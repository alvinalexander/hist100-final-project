Who would ever think that you would spread like mustard?
Shit got hot, you sent Feds to my spot
Took me to court, tried to take all I got

I sip the Dom P, watchin Gandhi til I'm charged
Then writin in my book of rhymes, all the words pass the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin, mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin time like
'Pappy' Mason with pens I'm embracin
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timb's on my feets, makes my cypher, complete
Whether crusin in a six-cab, or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin asleep
I keep fallin, but never fallin six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

To my man Ill Will, God bless your life ""It's yours!""
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip we box up crazy bitches aimin guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housin police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money gettin style, rollin foul
The versatile, honey stickin wild, golden child
Dwellin in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days, for broke days, we sell it, smoke pays
While all the old folks pray, to Je-sus' soakin they sins in trays
of holy water, odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinkin a word best describin my life, to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection
Born in correction all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction
How ya livin large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
You flippin coke or playin spit spades in strip poker

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down singlehanded
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside in a thousand miles from home
I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin my peeps, now the end could make my heartbeat skip
and I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana stabbin women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin big Willie style
Check the chip toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burnin dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks wit a bop, checkin Danes plus the games
people play, bust the problems of the world today

Dont try to fuck wit me yall
Cause you cant
Uhh, I stay way ahead of the game
Ya know, Catch me if you can nigga
Uhh, Haha

[Verse 1]
Throwback this, Throwback that
It aint where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
I rock the Reds Pete Rose when I'm in the 'Natti
And 4X, You cant see the semi-automatti
When I'm in the Chi' you think they aint that shocked
To see the kid roll through in the St. Pats Socks
So pull out the Chicago and the script to wear on Soul Train
The Bulls, When Mike had hair and a gold chain
I get the Spirit in St. Louis, How could the god lose
I do back flips in the Ozzie Cardinals
They love me in Cleveland, Everytime I travel there
I'm in the Indians or that Cavaliers
When I hit Minnesota, That kid from Brooklyn wear
The Vikings or the Timberwolves from Garnett's rookie year
And in Milwaukee I had to pimp it and go back
20 years with the Bucks and Brewers throw backs

[Chorus]
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It aint where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It aint where you for its where you wear ya throwback at

[Verse 2]
I might charge through San Diego with the bolts on my shoulder
Rock the Trailblazer warm-up, Cause Portland gets colder
And even the pimps be jealous
When I'm in the floor seat at the Forum in the M.P.L.S.
And they be askin' what teams on the kid chest
This the Rams before they moved to the Midwest
When I'm in the Bay with it, I dont play with it
Im in the Athletics with the matchin' A's fitted
This aint even for the minors
Cause they dont know nothin' bout the Joe Montana, 49ers
Seattle, Probally heard different rumors
Either about the Payton or the Griffey Jr.
I come through Denver like 4th quarter with Elway
Or the Nuggets that make them yell Ehhhh
In Pheonix I do the old Suns
Cause the new jerseys is cool, But nothings really like the old ones
Ya know

[Chorus]
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It aint where you for its where you wear ya throwback at
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It aint where you for its where you wear ya throwback at

[Verse 3]
In New York what I wear the the club may vary
Mets or Yankees like the Subway Series
When I'm in Boston I melt the bean
In a hot Red Soxs or Celtics green
In the city of Philly, I roll up on the biddes like feel these
In a size 56 Phillies
In Jersey I got the Nets on
That you can bet on
In D.C. I couldnt pull it
Without the Bullets
When I stop in Atlanta I cant talk long
Them birds know I got the Falcons or the Hawks on
That peach Tampa Bay dont hit the streets too often
Not even Miami could take the Heat of Dolphins
Aint no complaints on
When I'm in New Orleans with the Saints on
In Houston I pass hoes
In the Astros
In Dallas I always gotta have
The Cowboys or the Mavs
Tell Pete To keep it comin, And Imma keep it comin

[Chorus]
Throwback this, Throwback that
They even look better with the matching hat
All you gotta check is the players stats
It aint where you for its where you wear ya throwback at

Thrusted in a world that I don't know
from my mamas lips between my mamas hips
I'm cuddled by her hands because she understands
it's that bond that keeps the movement movin' on.
Life is surrounded with so many insecurities
back stabbin' is like breathing when in poverty.
I try to make my sanity, with the insane
God is secondary to most, when they scrap for money.
But, then again money can cause even more death.
when a African becomes a nigger step n fetch n all.
I dare say when price is right U can buy us all.
well not me, cuz I don't truly give a care about you.
I'll move in poverty, in wealth but I'll surely move!
Ain't syncopated with your beats or your wack grooves
my break beat is to break away from yo thang
All these things you put on me makes this brother sing...

Chorus:
I need some time to ease my mind.

Mind &amp;amp;amp; soul is even more important then body
money can put my body in all exotic spaces
meanwhile my mind &amp;amp;amp; soul remotely dwells
within that fine spot between all messed up &amp;amp;amp; hell.
And so I move on with confidence of harmony
And do my thang to resist this wack society
Cuz if you don't resist, &amp;amp;amp; I mean consciously
you'll fool your sub-conscious into accepting it.
I ain't acceptin' it - I keep my focus
I keep my focus - I ain't acceptin'it.
Give me a face pencil to draw a smile on me.
Answer my prayer to give my Earthly body inner peace
Answer my prayer to give my Earthly
body
inner
inner peace.
Until that day upon which my souls released!

It's that bond that will keep the movement movin' on

19,20,Chubb Rock,Treat  Em Right,Treat 'em Right,Chubb Rock,"Nineteen ninety
Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene
With a lean
And a pocket full of green
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
But RoboCop last year was a shock
The tone of the Popeye cut shook your butt
Kids are screaming; the media says, &amp;quot;What...
&amp;quot;Kind of music is this for you to dance to?&amp;quot;
The man with the plan and the man demands you
Leave the smack and the crack for the wack
Or the vile and the nine; keep a smile like that
Leave the knife and the gun in the store
And ignore temptation
Sent by the nation
Racial gain causes pain; need a new rep
In your hearts and minds never forget Yusef
Hawkins
And you're walking
You don't just run
Black on black; remember that; it's important
Anyway the shunless one brings forth the fun
No hatred; the summer's almost done
No time for sleep
Jump in your Jeep
And pump up the funky beat a whole week
Beeper goes off yo smash it and trash it
You're too young to be plumped in a casket
Just get your boys and bring the noise
And just swing it
And party people, sing it

Chorus:
Treat me right
I'll treat you good

Kids in the crib want dibs on the big man
&amp;quot;Can he come out? Can he come out and slam a jam?
&amp;quot;I'm his number one fan, yes I am&amp;quot;
All these kids realize that I'm the man
Six foot three and maybe a quarter of an inch bigger
Than last year, but still a unique figure
Rob Swinger, Doc No, Dinky, and Hot Dog know
That I'm a man who was born to have a mic on
Next to me at all time; ready to kick a rhyme
That will keep me out of financial bind
That's why when it comes to fans I'm never mean
Kids all see me between Gates and Green
Always say hello
Cause I'm a modest fellow
Never try and play a super star that's mellow
Cause if these kids don't go buy our records
We'll be has-beens and plus naked
So we owe them
So pull out your pen
Sign an autograph; you might make a new friend
So just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it
And party people in the house, sing it

Chorus

Party people in the house, listen up
I'm the man with the plan and the man rips it up
Peace to Howie Tee, good lookin', gee
Swinger, Hot Dog, Doc No, Bud, Ev Lover, Dinky
Fish and chips with the hippy hippy hips
Before the tune ends, give me some lips (ah!)
Sanity Crystal, my niece
And Lady Kazam, my homegirl, peace
And leave the guns and have fun; out!
And oh yeah, sing it

Chorus

Break

Well coming back
To nineteen ninety
Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene with a lean and a hardcore dream
The dream wasn't crafted to be pornographic
Decency started from the crib, plus kids
Don't need to hear all of that on the rap
The strength of my vibe placed Chubbs on the map
Cause authority, seniority goes far
My staff gives autographs plus gives nuff laughs
Read my mic, heed my sight, and definitely lead you right
Just treat me right
Peace

Treat me right
Treat me right
Treat me right",chubb rock

Woop-woop!
That's the sound of da police!
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of the beast!

[Yes, indeed]

Verse One:

Stand clear! Don man a-talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out! We run New York
Police man come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack, but you be doin' that
I'd rather say ""see ya""! Cause I would never be ya
Be a officer? You WICKED overseer!
Ya hotshot, wanna get props and be a saviour
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
Cause we be getting HYPED to the sound of da police!

Chorus

Verse Two:

Now here's a likkle truth, open up your eye
While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word ""overseer"" like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer!
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity?
Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off patroling all the nation
The overseer could stop you what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back to put a hole in your chest!
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've _got_ no choices!
The police them have a little gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

[Yes, indeed]
Chorus

Verse Three:

Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminals are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one PD
But just a mere Black man, them want check me
Them check out me car for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up til today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary Him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My GREAT grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great... when it's gonna stop?!

I'm not liven in tha Past, You wanna last
Be tha first ta blast, remember Kato

Ta bring me closer
To embrace an early death now there's nothing left
There was no mercy on tha streets
I couldn't rest
I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screaming peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' ta break free
They planted seeds and they hatched sparking tha flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just misery
Painting a picture of my enemies killing me in my sleep
Will I survive till' tha morning ta see tha sun
Please lord forgive me for my sins
Cause here I come...

Wonder why as I walk by
Broken hearted as I glance at tha chaulk line, gettin' high
This ain't tha life for me
I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me
I'm stuck in tha game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tangaray influenced me ta gettin crazy
Disillusioned lately
I've been really wanting babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady
Cause she's a product of this poison, i'm hearen noises
Think she's fucken on my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to tha floor
Beggin' for tha Lord ta let me in Heavens door

I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive on second hands

So then we moved to Shaolin land

Only way, I begin to gee off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rollin wit this one
And that one, pullin out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smokin woolies at 16
And running up and gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Stickin' up white boys on ball courts
My life got no betta, same damn 'lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
SO I GOT WIT A SICK ASS CLIQUE AND WENT ALL OUT!
Catchin keys from across seas
Rollin in MVP's, every week we made 40 g's
Yo nigga respect time, or anger the tech-9
Ch-chick-POW, move from the gate now

Verse 2: Inspectah Deck
It's been 22 long, hard years of still strugglin'
Survival got me buggin', but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world 'cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M.
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of 15
A young buck sellin drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not... could not...
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin -- going up state's my destination
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so ruff
But as the world turns I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Everyday I escape from Jakes givin chase, sellin base
Smokin bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed, and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the Old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
And stray shots, all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young black youth
But shorty's running wild smokin sess drinkin beer
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kickin in his ear
Neglected, but now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic

Verse One: Scientific Shabazz

Bear witness, as I exercize my exorcism
The evil that lurks within the sin, the terrorism
Possessed by evil spirits, voices from the dead
I come forth with Gravediggaz in a head full of dread
I've been examined ever since I was semen
They took a sonogram and seen the image of a demon
At birth the nurses surrounded me with needles
and drugged me all up with the diseases of evil
Grew up in hell, now I dwell, in an Islamic Temple
I'm fighting a holy war in the mental
Look deep into my eyes, you'll see visions of death
Possessed by homicide is what I'm obsessed
Giving niggaz brain dimples
Dragging they asses on my hook by they temples
The cause of death is unknown to the cops
Cause when I kill them, I'm not leavin one element to autopse
First I'll assassinate em
And them I'll cremate them
and take all of his fucking ashes and evaporate em
Or creep through the graveyard and hunt down your tombstone
Dig up your skeleton and stomp all your fucking bones
You try to haunt me nigga, I ain't trying to hear it
Buck Buck Buck, I'll give your ass a holy spirit.

Verse Two: Prince Rakeem/Rzarector

The year 84, November, day 10
Overwhelmed by the wicked inspirations of an evil gen
I realize my ideas has spawned for 400 years
Of blood sweat and tears
I saw the torture, brutal murder of my father
So my brain became stained with the horror
I'm having recurring nightmares
Of being soaking wet, strapped down to the electric chair
I got tackled with handcuffs
And shackled in restraint
At the bottom of a holy tabernacle
They gave me nothing to eat for two weeks
And sewed my eyelids open so I couldn't sleep
About to die from thirst, that's when the minister
quenched my jaws with a cold glass of vinegar
Upon my wounds they seasoned me with salt
And nailed my hands feet to the form of the cross
AHH!! I cry
As the blood drips inside of my eye
refusing to die
Visions of hell tormented my face
So I chewed my fucking arm off and made an escape.

Verse Three: Killah Priest

Enter the realms of understanding
And take good heed
And you could bleed
While I'm standing
Three stages of pure hell
Justications of red cells
*SHH* rain drops hits the pelv
Path is dull and narrow
You're stalked by a shadow
I pierced your skull with a fucking arrow
So narrow, only one could enter at a time
Stuck in the center, read the signs
A thousand doors to choose
You better hurry
Don't stop, shit is getting hot as a pot of curry
On your right side there's fire
On you left, deep waters
Watch your step, it's deep waters!
What's that coming through the floor?
It's a claw
*PSSH* took his fucking ass to the fucking core

Verse Four: Frukwan/Gatekeeper

Stroll through the dark conditions
I stone you till I see sparks of friction
I chop ya like a coal miner
Then combine the drug
And mix it with your blood
Some more
I give you some more
And watch you crawl
Guts hit the floor
Worms that dig your pores
I trick ya, ha, then I'm quick to syringe
Deep into my thoughts and bust out your skin
You scream, portraits of inflictable pain
You can't stand
You're up to your hands in quicksand
You're sinking and sinking deep into the earth
Thoughts was possessed since the first day of birth
My mental says it's my turn to possess the matter
Stab you with a dagger
Of Jacob's Ladder

I wrote these words for everyone
Who struggles in their youth
Who won't accept deception
Instead of what is truth
It seems we lose the game,
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules? We're so confused
Easily led astray
Let me tell ya that
Everything is everything
(Everything is everything)

After winter, must come spring

Possibly speak tongues
Beat drum, Abyssinian, street Baptist
Rap this in fine linen
From the beginning
My practice extending across the atlas
I begat this
Flippin' in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You can't match this rapper / actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti
MCs ain't ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of Sister Betty
L. Boogie spars with stars and constellations
Then came down for a little conversation
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum
Now hear this mixture
Where hip hop meets scripture
Develop a negative into a positive picture

Now everything, is everything
What is meant to be, will be
After winter, must come spring
Change, it comes eventually

Sometimes it seems
We'll touch that dream
But things come slow or not at all
And the ones on top, won't make it stop
So convinced that they might fall
Let's love ourselves then we can't fail
To make a better situation
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow
All we need is dedication

Let me tell ya that,
Everything is everything

Tchka-tchka-tchka-tchka Bubba

[Bubba Sparxx]
I ain't choose to rhyme; rhymin chose me
So I hit the track runnin - like a nosebleed
Life ain't great now, but it's much improved
Your album droppin this summer? That sucks for you
Cause this is Bubba's moment - I put my mother on it
I said my momma; it seems as if I love her don't it?
So buckle up, cause it's gon' get bumpy
I call my girlfriends Betty's, and my shits grumpies
That Bubba talk - gotcha open wide
I giggle outside the booth; but ain't no joke inside
This is complicated - at least to y'all it is
Just let me sell fifty million, then I'll call it quits
But until that day, y'all in deep doo doo
I never once saw you crank it cause I just sleep through you
What you need to do, is just admit you love me
The South has always been Dirty but now it's gettin ugly

[Chorus]
Uglyyyyyyyyyy - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get uglyyyyyyyyyy - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get uglyyyyyyyyyy, uglyyy, uglyyy
In here! Huh, in here!
It's gon' get uglyyyyyyyyyy - in here!
Huh, in here! Huh, in here - uh-ohh!

[Bubba Sparxx]
Though I am country, don't get the wrong idea
My ego's gettin bigger, with every song I hear
Cause y'all been bullshittin, spittin that booty chatter
Out here for two days and came with somethin that truly matters
On goes the saga - of Bubba's plight
She won't see tomorrah, if I don't cut tonight
That's just my mood now; I hate it came to this
How else can I say it I don't speak no other languages
I'm fairly ripped now, so this the jimmy talkin
You hear that beat don'tcha? That's just Timmy talkin
Go 'head throw dem bows - fuck it, break a bottle
Let's be honest none of us will ever date a model
So let's just cut it loose, ignore the repercussions
If you scared, then just forget what we discussin
This that new South - take a picture of me
Cause I'm a fuckin legend, and this is gettin ugly

[Chorus]

[Bubba Sparxx]
Now this thang is jumpin - ain't it somethin?
What makes it special, this whole moment came from nothin
Now you see it triples; I bet she slurp tonight
Lames hide your wallets hatin broads clutch your purses tight
If you ain't tryin to live, you with the wrong crowd
And if you feelin brave then better sport that thong proud
And if you finally breathin, then sing this song loud
I'm glad I got you wet I know you had a long drought
Don't worry about the law - they can't arrest us all
I had to crank couldn'ta done nothin less for y'all
Forget your inhibitions; I wanna see you whylin
And if Bubba dies tonight - know he was smilin

[Chorus]

Ha ha, it's gon' get (uglyyyyyyyyyy - in here!)

Uh, uh, uh, now let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step wit'
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't five-O, y'all know it's Nas yo
Grey goose and a whole lotta hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well dressed with finesse
In a white tee lookin for wifie
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive thru the city no doubt, but don't say my car's topless
Say the titties is out, newness here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot wit'
Push the pool stick in your new crib, same hand that you hoop with
Swing around like you stupid, king'a the town, yeah I been that
You know I click-clack where you and your men's at
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back

They shootin'! Aw made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?

They shootin'! Aw made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' big money, playboy your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

This ain't rappin, this is Street-Hop
Now get up off your ass like your seat's hot
My live niggaz lit up the reefer
Trunk� a the car we got the street sweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music diffuse all attention
Ballas convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers'ca move swift
Girls get close, you'ca feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phoney
Pull out my waist, the eagle fo-forty

They shootin'! Aw made you look

Gettin' big money, playboy your time's up

Make backspins, back seat, TV plasma
Ladies lookin for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is, show me love
Lemme feel how the head is
Females whose the sexiest is always the nastiest

And I like a little sassiness, a lotta class

Ah one two ah one two (repeat 6X)

Verse One: Posdonus

I was born in the Boogie Down catscan
where my building fell down on the rats and
people sorta super wanna trip to the penile (penile)
While I settle off the shores of the Long Isle
My father's clean not mean my mind is clear when I transmit
I am the man ner of the family cuz the pants fit
I want to let forensics prove, that I can mends
Groove wit the thread from needle outta hay, wanna say
salutations to the nation of the Nubians
We bout to place you in that +3 Feet+ of stew again
I got the frequency to shatter Mrs. Jones' perm
I gotta +Hey Love+ all the honies cause they're short term
Tallyin the score I'm for the shottie in the jacket
For the brother he's a nigga when he packs it
So get your butt out the sling, I stung Muhammad float a note
that means I'm def, so like the autographs you sign until the

""Breakadawn.. breakadawn..""
Ah one two, ah one two (repeat 4X)

Verse Two: Dove, Posdonus

Aiyyo groove with the mayor, hazard on the sayer
Wave the eighteen mill', eat a still
sack or bag of troubles, make the single double
Loop the coin and join the minimum wage
I had a plan if I was the man, I'd throw the J
Lay it low and late night I get sessed
Uncondition my ways, of the everyday sunset
Wagin my days, to the one bet
Cause your breaks'll have the carrot of cakes, whether mine
Out of line, I breeze into the early mornin
Freak the WIC call and get a tap on my shoulder
cause the days of the breaks, be just about over
The arts of the six won't play my bag of tricks
I got the sevens in my pocket somewhere
Reasons for the Cheer All Temperature here
I keep it to the rear, and then I'm EXPLODING

I be the fab I be the fabulous but see unlike the Chi
I got the flea up in the name ""ah one two, ah one two""
Can't no one bend my cousin from the Peter Piper like the others
latchin on to when I caught the fame ""ah one two, ah one two""
Pass the task to ask me bout the Native Tongue again my friend
I tell you Jungle Brothers +On the Run+ ""ah one two, ah one two""
I'm shakin hands with many devils in the industry
Believe the Genesis life fill with stills mean that I'm def
so like the autographs you sign until the

Ah one two, ah one two (repeat 4X)

Verse Three: Dove, Posdonus

We in the mornin at the end, but in the end I be the is
cause in the mix, man, it's alright
Momma got the rhythm to my daylife
My pops gots enough so best to leave or sail the waves
to the Long I laid the anchor in the 'Ville
And how I relate, the same side of my gates
Paper days, mess up my mind, ground zero degrees
and the weather feels fine
You opened my eyes man, thought I had a man
But how could I eyescan, I wasn't around
I seen the states and played the dates in the far-far
Gathered the new, from the zoas around
Grew up with Mikey Rodes and played the codes
Sometimes I don't budge, without my cous' Fuzz/fuzz
A simple, ""How ya do?"" Ah check it from my friends and my crew
makes it definitely special

Now there's no +Shiny Happy People+ in the crew we play the rough
I got the huff, and puff, to blow the house low
You know the neverending factor while I'm over, tell a squid
I know an Enterprising brother, so report to the bridge
I bounce a ball with my left, a squid with my right
(Cause a squid is just a punk) Yo he deserved to lose the fight
I might meander 'cross your dream, travellin up the stream
Plug Wonder Wonder Why you're lonely tonight
We see the girls scream as if we're shocked by the live shell
Let's round em up and get em back to the hotel
motel, holiday, inn-fact!
I'm gonna let you know, once again, that De La Soul
is sure to show you we will hit the charter harder

But you'd rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars
Tell me, who I have to be
To gain some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will

Is this just a silly game
That forces you to act this way
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you can't stay
Tell me, who I have to be
To gain some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will

Hook:
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't workin'
It ain't workin'
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy
This is crazy

I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else
See I know what we got to do
You let go and I'll let go too
'Cause no one's hurt me more than you
And no one ever will

Repeat Hook

Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me

There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me

Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me

Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me

I could get that dough, you know I'm with that yo
And the thing about the shit I came through, I haven't seen
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin dreams
All nightmares, the light dares to desert me
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me
Paranoid, so I strike out at what ever
The closest thing to me is gonna get it
but, never Will I, can I think death is wrong
So I'ma keep holdin on til, what's left is gone
You could put that on my nigga Boone
These other rap cats will give a nigga room
But if it ccalls for me to force my way in the door
Headhuntin mother fuckers,so stay on the floor

Four more, now all this is liquid rrrrrr

Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife
Scratch, shank, and hold all night
So when you hear the arf arf, start runnin
Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm comin
But I don’t like drama so I say to myself,
&amp;quot;Keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth
I want the money and give me the honeys with big asses
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses&amp;quot;
I'm broke so I'ma bash his head wide open
Beggin me to stop but at least he died hopin
Didn't get his wish,now he's a dish for the pack

Locks off the cage, gauge, With the buck shots, faggot
You've been lucky all day thats when your luck stops
One drops, and another and another
Gun pops, go into you and your mother
When does it all end, I found a friend in a dog
Cause fuckin wit these cats will send a friend to the morgue
Many questions, no answers, just stress
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed
If you curse and it gets worse as time goes by
Can't see straight cause I'm so high, Why ask why when you know
Nigga when its your time to go, roll

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me, mirror, what is wrong?
Can it be my De La clothes
Or is it just my De La song?
What I do ain't make-beleive
People say I sit and try
But whan it comes to being De La
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

POS:
Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No, we're not, that's pure Plug bull
Always pushing that we've formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
It's just me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Proud, I'm proud of what I am
Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please oh please let Plug Two be
Himself, not what you read or write
Right is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul, De La that is,
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of showbiz
De La Soul is from the soul
And this fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me myself and I

It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

Glory, glory hallelu
Glory for Plugs One and Two

By kizids and dookie eyes
People think they dis my person
By stating I'm darkly pack
I know this so I point at Q-Tip
And he states, 'Black is Black'
Mirror mirror on the wall,
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Please keep on up with the nuts
So I don't get in aftermath
But if I do I'll calmly punch them
In the fourth day of July
'Cause they tried to mess with
Third degree, that's me myself and I

The one that be dropping these albums, showing 'em how to come back
And you gon' respect me and appreciate where I run at
You ain't gone piss me off, cause you sorry that you done that
I gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious
You don't even much wanna see the rest
I'm coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set
I ain't even started yet

Stop that trippin', causin it ain't gone happin'

Two dollars means a snack for me,
but it means a big deal to you
""Be strong, serve God only,
know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits""
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr. Wendal, that's his name,
no one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum,
until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges,
still most of y'all come out confused

Go ahead, Mr.Wendal (2x)

Mr.Wendal has freedom,
a free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
for Mr.Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
and an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him,
but I just saw him
eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no?
Who are we to judge?
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
and killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
but we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far,
and we got too far, cause on him we walk

Mr.Wendal, a man, a human in flesh,
but not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride,
realize that all in all you stand tall

Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly cause hip hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue-suede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era?
Was fresh and fat since they started sayin audi
Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie

umbrellas, you won't be needing those today...
Look to the clouds with the most rain coming from it, for without the
rain there's no me and there's no you...
I said a drip-drop, a drip-drop, drip-drop
viva bum bum bum drip-drop ...

Let it rain, let it rain, let God's water feed me
The water of life, mentally rinsing me, physically drenching me
Most are frowning upon your arrival
but I need you for survival
And when you fall on my community
I run outside to properly
greet you
Let it rain, take my pain, I'm glad to meet you
Fill my eyes with a colorful rainbow
Every drop hits me, fills me
with an unmeasurable amount of security
knowing my God acknowledges me
as if each drop of rain is aimed toward me

It's raining revolution (7x)

I struttle strut thru the ghetto
The rain this time I feel is mental
The goal of this rain I feel is spiritual
Saw thru the eyes of the inflicted people
Their eyes are hard as a million thombstones
marked with the names of the millions of kin thrown
to the dust that gave them their colored skin
Fade to black is the scene they're embalmed in
The rain many nights have witnessed her
Receiving the sperm of a brother into a sister
and blessed that life to guaranteed existence
A conscious baby for a black resistance
I feel the rain enhances the revolution
and reminds us of a spiritual solution
and reminds us of an unnatural supernatural solu-lu-lu-lution

Raise your hands up high and let me see the colors of your beautiful skin

Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout.
I had nothing, and I wanted it.
You had everything, and you flaunted it.
Turned the needy into the greedy,

Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox.
Every dollar I get, another brother drops.
Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand,
God damn----you got me sinkin in quicksand.
But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned,
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn.

Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh.
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam,
Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block,
You wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot.

You don't come here much, and ya better not.

I gotta get more money than you got,
So what, if some muthafucka gets shot?
That's how the game is played,
Another brother slayed, the wound is deep
BUT they're givin us a Band Aid.

Raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro.

In mic fights I swing swords and cut clown
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
on some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was yo out the shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rollin smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played, like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
that attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton BOMBS more faster than you blink

Only under one circumstance is if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my ""Clan in Da Front"" want it

But when I swing my swords they all choppable

Lyrics are weak, like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
while your plan failed, hit the rail, like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by low, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
round the clock, that state pen time check it
With the pens I be stickin but you can't stick to crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells

Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels

Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

794,795,LL Cool J,Hey Lover,Hey Lover,LL Cool J,"I've been watchin' you from afar,
for as long as I can remember.
You're all a real man can need,
and ever asked for
This is love girl.
This is more than a crush, yeah.

It was Harlem at the Ruckers
I saw ya witcha man
smiling, huh, a coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the Coupe with my hat turned back
we caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
so i skated off, as you strolled off
looking at the legs, god damn, they look so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man, that's my mission
If this love is real, he's got to handle competition
you only knew him 5 months (that's right)
besides he drink too much, and smoke too many blunts
and I be working out everyday thinking bout you
looking at my own eyes in the rear view
catchin flash backs of our eye contact
wish i could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
i would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I ain't had a crush in years, hey lover

hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (2x)

I see you at the bus stop waitin everyday
your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
and i don't wanna violate your relationship
so i lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
still he can't stop me from having day dreams
tounging you down with, huh, vanilla ice cream
kissing on your thighs under the moonlight
searching your body with my tounge girl all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams could turn into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
we would walk down the isle of destiny
what your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
that seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
but there's a deeper level if you'd follow I'll lead
Hey lover

hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (2x)

Last week I saw ya at the mall
standing at the pay phone bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
we talked about traveling the distant lands
escaping all the madness out here in the world
becomin my wife no longer my girl
then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
i kissed you softly and you yearned for more
we experienced pleasure unparallel
into an ocean of love we both fell
swimming in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
fantasies interchanging with each kiss
undying passion unites our souls
together we swim until the point of no control
but it's a fantasy it won't come true
we never even spoke and your man swear he love you
so I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside
keep my dreams alive until the right time

hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush (2x)",ll cool j

Found the courage that can free me this time

We're playin' by a new set of rules
Baby these were not designed for some fool
See, I've taken all that I'm gonna take
It's the rest of my life that's at stake

So, don't you come around drinkin' high and thinkin'
I'm gonna lay down, 'cause you're wrong, you're so wrong
I'm through with letting you walk in, do the talkin'
Puttin' your hands where they don't belong, they don't belong
You can't just show up, use me, lie and abuse me
This time baby - stay gone, you can stay gone

I'm no longer falling apart
See, I finally got you out of my heart
And if I ever think of taking you back
You'll remind me how I feel about that

So don't you come around drinkin', high and thinkin'
I'm gonna lay down, 'cause you're wrong, oh yeah damn wrong
I'm through with letting you walk in do the talkin'
Puttin' your hands where you know they don't belong, no, no they don't belong
You can't just show up, use me, lie and abuse me
This time baby, you, you, you - you can stay gone
(You can stay gone...)

I don't need the smooth talk on a good night
Doin' just fine, doin' alright - stay gone
(I don't need you, no)

I don't need the false hope, or the bad dope
Or the rough love, had enough of it - stay gone

You can't be a no show, whem I'm real low
It's a no blow, it's a no go - stay gone, stay gone...gone

So don't you come around drinkin', sad and steamin'
Baby let me tell you
I won't work this time
It ain't gonna work no
Ain't gonna work no
I'm tired of letting you hurt me, scream and curse me
Baby, that pain is more than you're worth
Today is gonna be my day, find you a highway
Hear me baby, stay gone - you can stay gone

You can stay, out there, somewhere
I don't care, I don't care - stay gone

You can take a slow boat or a long road
To a fast plane, to a slow train

Frontin' in his ride with his home boys braggin'
Lying 'bout the Lyte how he knocked boots last night
But he's a ruffneck so that's alright
Triple o baldie under the hood
Makin' noise with the boys up to no good
C-low on the down low cops come around so ruffneck front like he gotta go
Evil grin with a mouth full of gold teeth
Startin' beef is how he spells relief
Actin' like he don't care
When all I gotta do is beep him 911 and he'll be there
Right by my side with his ruffneck tactics
Ruffneck attitude,the ruffneck bastard

To put out the spliff and get stiff
Boxer shorts and everything is fitting large
But he don't gotta be large to be in charge
Pumpin' in and out and out and in and here we go
He knows exactly how I want my flow and that's slow
Never questioning can he get buck wild
He's got smack it,lick it,swallow it up style
Drinkin' a beer ,sittin' his chair
Hands in his pants fiddlin' with his dick hairs
He's a rudeboy,a raggamuf
Ready to bag another brother that he ranks ruff enough
'Cause if it ain't ruff it ain't right
And if he ain't ruff,well then he's all wrong for the Lyte
I love my ruffneck and ain't nothing going down
Or going up if my ruffneck ain't in town

966,967,D.J. Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,Parents Just Don't Understand,Parents Just Don't Understand,DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince,"You know parents are the same

No matter time nor place

They don't understand that us kids

Are going to make some mistakes

So to you, all the kids all across the land

There's no need to argue

Parents just don't understand

I remember one year

My mom took me school shopping

It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister

All hopped in the car

We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall

My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose

I didn't say nothing at first

I just turned up my nose

She said, &amp;amp;quot;What's wrong? This shirt cost $20&amp;amp;quot;

I said, &amp;amp;quot;Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!&amp;amp;quot;

The next half hour was the same old thing

My mother buying me clothes from 1963

And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate

I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!

I said, &amp;amp;quot;Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep&amp;amp;quot;

She said, &amp;amp;quot;You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet&amp;amp;quot;

I said, &amp;amp;quot;Mom, let's put these clothes back, please&amp;amp;quot;

She said &amp;amp;quot;no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show&amp;amp;quot;

I said, &amp;amp;quot;This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer

Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers

But if you don't want to I can live with that but

You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks&amp;amp;quot;

She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same

Inevitably the first day of school came

I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick

But my mom said, &amp;amp;quot;No, no way, uh-uh, forget it&amp;amp;quot;

There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax

I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts

And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought

The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought

And those who weren't laughing still had a ball

Because they were pointing and whispering

As I walked down the hall

I got home and told my Mom how my day went

She said, &amp;amp;quot;If they were laughing you don't need the,

&amp;amp;quot;Cause they're not good friends&amp;amp;quot;

For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom

That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times

So to you all the kids all across the land

There's no need to argue

Parents just don't understand

Oh-kay, here's the situation

My parents went away on a week's vacation and

They left the keys to the brand new Porsche

Would they mind?

Umm, well, of course not

I'll just take it for a little spin

And maybe show it off to a couple of friends

I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood

Well, maybe I shouldn't

Yeah, of course I should

Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot

I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block

That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking

I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking

You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions

I honked my horn just to get her attention

She said, &amp;amp;quot;Was that for me?&amp;amp;quot;

I said, &amp;amp;quot;Yeah&amp;amp;quot;

She said, &amp;amp;quot;Why?&amp;amp;quot;

I said, &amp;amp;quot;Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy&amp;amp;quot;

She said, &amp;amp;quot;How do I know you're not sick?

You could be some deranged lunatic&amp;amp;quot;

I said, &amp;amp;quot;C'mon toots - my name is the Prince =

Beside, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?&amp;amp;quot;

She agreed and we were on our way

She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word

We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive

We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes

She kicked her shoes off onto the floor

She said, &amp;amp;quot;Drive fast, speed turns me on&amp;amp;quot;

She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas

We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast

The sun roof was open , the music was high

And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh

She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far

I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car

We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche

And to make this long story short - short

When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell

I said, &amp;amp;quot;I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer&amp;amp;quot;

I almost had a heart attack that day

Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway

I was arrested, the car was impounded

There was no way for me to avoid being grounded

My parents had to come off from vacation to get me

I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me

My parents walked in

I got my grip, I said, &amp;amp;quot;Ah, Mom, Dad, how was your trip?&amp;amp;quot;

They didn't speak

I said, &amp;amp;quot;I want to plead my case&amp;amp;quot;

But my father just shoved me in the car by my face

That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived

They took turns -

One would beat me while the other one was driving

I can't believe it, I just made a mistake

Well parents are the same no matter time nor place

So to you all the kids all across the land

Take it from me

Parents just don't understand",d.j. jazzy jeff & the fresh prince

Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in you confused things
Should I just sit out or come harder
Help me find my way

Messin' me up, my whole head
Teasing me, just like Tisha did Martin
Now look, at what you starting
School boy crush, and it ain't on the hush
The whole world, see it, but you can't
My people's they complain, sittin' rave and rant
Your name is out my mouth like a ancient chant
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant

Speaking of which, got a leash and a wish, just to rock you miss
Make a militant move, peep my strategy
End of the day you're not mad at me
Not dealing with nobody now, that's what you told me
I said hey yo it's cool, we could just be friendly
Cause yo, picture me messin it up
Her mind I corrupt with the ill C-cups
Shiiit, I'm on my day off
Bullshittin, hopin' that the day go slow
Got me like a friend, what confuses me though
It's kisses when we breeze, tell me what the deal yo

{Chorus} (2x)

Now why you wanna go and do that love huh
Making things for me towards you harder
Killing me, just when I think we there
You doubts the whole vibe and it floats in the air
Tellin' me, bout next man
But next man ain't the nigga wit the plans
Who, got your heart in mind
It's about time that you just unwind

And let it just happen, make it front-free
Just sweat me like money paney
Diggin' you, gettin inside of your stee'
It's the quest cat, keepin you company
Forever or however you want it

Word word
Now wait a minute ma, before you dead into the curb
Try to make impressions which is good, not the herb
But it, it it ain't me, and I, I ain't blurred
I'ma still just chill wit you
Maybe this'll change if you change your view
If not, then I guess it is cool
Just, keep to yourself and abide by the rules

Shake it out now (repeats)

Bitches high for a ride dependin who key startin
So f**k a Jaguar
Cop a Aston Martin, pardon
No talkin, Mr. say sparkin
Niggas can't understand
They still walkin

Chorus

Hot ass whips is what they see Boo in
We play down in C-A-C-U-N
Uh, nice wit the O flex outta line
Cut a bitch off like O.J.
Yall aint ready
That's why all yall niggas look hurt
When yall see me
More Franklin's than Kirk
And I'm spendin em wit GP
Thick tube socks I rock like I'm from DC
Cash Money as in Juvenile like BG

(Mr.)
Top down on the Cadillac Allante'
I get street stripes like Carlito Picante
Dog, I tax yall cause it costs to live
And still show no love like foster kids
I rent out homes in the hood and live across the bridge
My car hotter than the grill
While yall walk, I wheel
Oh, your Rolie go tick and tock? It's not real
And keep a piece around my neck I know worth ya deal, nigga

You can get crunk in the club
Roll wit your hood
Get stomped in the club

Get fucked up in the club
Nigga we don't give a fuck
But you don't want no problem (Problem)
But you don't want no problem (Problem)
But you don't want no problem with me
Cuz BME we be 50 deep

You don't wanna be dead in the streets
Mouth full of blood and soaked from the heat (Ooo)
Why you tryna act hard as hell
And you know damn well you don't wanna feel the shell
Nigga I been down by a lot
Gun to my head, pressed dead to the wall
I got big balls and bullets like baseballs
Split ya dome, put you straight, knock out all ya'll
Hell no them boys don't play
Straight nuts to ya face
Put your pistol away
And don't weed to my head
I pray for the folks in the club gettin scared

Hold em back, hold em back
Man fuck that nigga
Fuck that hold em back

Hold em back, hold em back

Keep poppin in my face and get popped in the dome
Learn to rush mothafuckas
It's gonna hurt
If a nigga fall
That's when shit gets worse
The problem with you niggas is
You just talk too much
Man swang on a nigga and fuck his ass up
And you can walk on by with your nuts in a tub
I'll be your ? if you really won't get crunk
In the A we don't play them games
We just stack and slang and load up them things
Gettin buck if you wanna and catch a bow
Keep your pretty ass gull, beat your ass, and take your hoe

Hehe, cause you boys ain't with you
Little do they know, your girl roll harder than
Some of yo niggas

Now what the hell is you lookin' for?
Can't a young man get money anymore?
Let my pants sag down to the floor
Really do it matter as long as I score?
Can't my car look better than yours?
Can I have a bad bitch without no flaws
Come to see me without no drawers
In a stretch Lex with about ten doors?
How is murder?
P. Diddy name me pretty
Did it for the money, now can you get with me?
People wanna know who is he, he get busy
Spray so much izzy, girls get dizzy

Cuz on the real, look at me

Dissin' every gear, but they better listen here
You cats keepin' it real, you cats is on yo own
Cuz bein' broke and alone is something I can't condone
Plus it won't be long till they send me the dome
Sit gently, while I'm on the Bentley phone
Why you don't like me?
Cuz I'm mad fly and icy?
And why you can't satisfy yo wifey
And if it wasn't for this Bad Boy exposure
CD, TV's, really would I know ya
Now me and blink float in the gold Rover
So it's only right you get the cold shoulder
And if you got a girl, don't be real committed
Cuz Mase will hit it, you got to deal with it

Who looked good enough to be Miss Miami
But say, since some her peeps call her Candy
Than she starts to ask about Aaliyah and Brandy
Tellin' me how she met Puff down at the Grammy's
He ain't tell you I was the one with no panties?
Boo, you know how many he meet with no panties?
Please, tell me something that I don't know
Like if we have sex, you don't want dough
And if it's not a problem you can meet me at 10
I'll be in room 112 and bring four friends
And if you gon' hit me, it gotta be a quickie

And the birds are offering up their tunes
In a shack as remote as a mansion
You escape into a place where nothing moves

But I can't begin to face up to the truth
I wait so long
For the walls to crack
But I know that I will one day have you back

And the hills
Are as soft as a pillow
And they cast a shadow on my bed
And the view
When I look through my window
Is an altarpiece I'm praying to
For the living and the dead

Twin valleys shine in the morning sun
I send a message out to my only one

Yet I've been locked out
And I know we're through
But I can't begin to face up to the truth
I wait so long
For the walls to crack
But I know that I will one day have you back

Yo for now we on the run, yo if that ain't clear
Weak niggas wanna stick, you but that ain't fair
You we down in vegas, money, skies too courageous
And yo, I'm on the run, but still rip stages

Hold hands, slow-dance while the record spins,
Opened up your heart 'cause you said I made you feel so comfortable,
Used to play back then, now you all grown-up like Rudy Huxtable,
I could be your bud, you could beat me up,
Play-fight in the dark, then we both make love,
I'd do anything just to feel your butt,
Why you got me so messed up?
I don't know, but you gotta stop trippin',
Be a good girl now, turn around, and get these whippings,
You know you like it like that,
You don't have to fight back,
Here's a pillow - bite...that,
And I'll be settin' seperate plays,
So on all these separate days,
Your legs can go they separate...ways...

Turned her round, gave her bottom a smack, smack
She's a woman from the block with the best of weed
But I won't stop till I'm pullin out tracks, tracks
It was lust at first sight
And she couldn't help sayin that she wanted to get with me
And my style was just right
'cause she wanted a man with a little sec-ur-ity
Said I been around the world twice
And my name ring bells from Atlanta to Sic-i-ly
Said she wanted it all night

Sweetie you look so incredible
So delicious and so damn edible
All I need is some honey or syrup
With a lil' butter to rub down all your curves
And no need for the lemonade
Just a twist of lime and some grape Kool-Aid
Can I call you Caramel?
'cause I'm bout to go coo-coo to taste your Coco Puffs
One bowl ought to fill me up
But that milk gotta be cold enough
So supper time that'll hold me up
I might choke myself if I don't slow it up, but
Honey, you look like a honeydew melon
Or strawberry with the whipped cream filling
Of the top part of the peach cobbler
But uh, the fruit platter ought to do me better

Uh, uhh, listen
First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got a problem with Hov'
Whassup y'all niggaz all fed up cause I got a little cheddar
and my records movin out the sto'?
Young fucks spittin at me, young rappers gettin at me
My nigga Big predicted the shit exactly
""Mo' Money, Mo' Problems"" - gotta move carefully
Cause faggots hate when you gettin money like athletes
Yung'uns ice-grillin me, ohh - you not feelin me?
Fine; it cost you nothin - pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind cousin, ain't got time for frontin
Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs
Damn though mans I'm just tryin do me
If the record's two mill' I'm just tryin move three
Get a couple of chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll menage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, fuck I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggaz I don't mean to ruffle y'all
I know you waitin in the wing but I'm doin my thing
Where's the love?

""Ain't no love, in the heart of the city..""
I said where's the love?
""Ain't no love, in the heart of town..""
Yeah..

And then the Fugees gon' break up, now everyday I wake up
Somebody got somethin to say
What's all the fuckin fussin for? Because I'm grubbin more
and I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
Niggaz pray and pray on my downfall
But everytime I hit the ground I bounce up like roundball
Now I don't wanna have to kill sound bar
Don't wanna have to cock back the four pound bar
Look scrapper I got nephews to look after
I'm not lookin at you dudes, I'm lookin past ya
I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper
Can I live? I told you in ninety-six
that I came to take this shit and I did, handle my biz
I scramble like Randall with his
Cunning-ham but the only thing runnin is numbers fam
Jigga held you down six summers; damn, where's the love?

""Ain't no love, in the heart of the city..""
Niggaz, where's the love?
""Ain't no love, in the heart of town..""
Holla at me!!
""Ain't no love"" (take 'em to church) ""in the heart of the city..""
Uh, uh, uh - my nigga where's the love?
""Ain't no love, in the heart of town..""
Fuck
Then Richard Pryor go and burn up, and Ike and Tina Turner break up
Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful you'll pull this shit
Nigga I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin to alla y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
Whatchu mad cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy a bigger place
Hehehe, and more baggies, why you all aggie?
Nigga respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me shit - where's the love?

Where's the love?

Let me begin
I came to win
Battle me, that's a sin
I won't tear the sack up
Punk you'd better back up
Try and play the role and yo the whole crew will act up
Get up, stand up [come on!]
Come on, throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling, jump up touch the ceiling
Muggs lifts a funk flow, someone's talking junk, yo
I'll bust him in the eye
And then I'll take the punk's ho
Feelin', funkin'
Amps in the trunk
And I got more rhymes than there's cops that at a Dunkin'
Donut shop
Sure 'nuff I got props from the kids on the Hill
Plus my mom and my pops

Chorus

I came to get down (2x)
So get out your seats and jump around
Jump around (3x)
Jump up Jump up and get down.
Jump (17x)

I'll serve your ass like John MacEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the ho
Word to your moms I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son, I've returned
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned
Cause I got lyrics but you ain't got none
If you come to battle bring a shotgun!
But if you do you're a fool, cause I duel to the death
Tryin' to step to me you'll take your last breath
I got the skill, come get your fill
'Cause when I shoot to give, I shoot to kill

Chorus

I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a terminator
Like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Tryin' to play me out like as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and you know I might switch
It up up and around, then buck buck you down
Put out your head then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie I'll wet ya

With so many things to do
I want to go again I want another ride
This time should see it through

We never realised as the years rolled by
No we never really had a clue
But we knew one day we'd come alive
And in the end there's me and you

My babe, she gives me everything
She gives me everything I need

When the winter comes and the cold sets in
As this city's prone to do
They forecast heavy seas and gale force winds
that's really nothing new

When I'm falling down
Deeper than the underground
My thoughts race back to you
Again and again

My babe, she gives me everything
she gives me everything I need

And if you think us fools
And you criticize
Then my friend the joke's on you

And drive cars so big you can't reach the pedal
Never had a glass of purple juice for breakfast

To my thick chicks down in Texas
All the way to New Orleans where da girls cook catfish
And in LA every chick's an actress
Hollywood status with the shaded glasses
To Detroit, yeah the place that I rest
Where the ladies got ass to sell a lot of sex
And Hot Atlanta y'all is one of the best
Where they speak southern and slang and smoke la cess
And New York women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine it's so selfish
Maybe I'm feelin myself too much I guess
But, to my ladies all across the globe
In small towns that I don't even know
To all local international codes
Whether you see me in streets or catch me at shows, I'm callin...

And for them fake boobies I payed them Benjies
Get your own, I got Paris he got Nicky he tried to get em a clone
He said yeah you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus' niece
Can I please, say my peace
If y'all fresh to death, then I'm deceased
And this one here, is a heat rocks
Spit like a beat box, the way the beat rocks
New version of Pete Rock!
But for that Benz I get CL love
So I switch my girls around like 3LW
I'm calling

Hope he feels better, and thanks Jonetta from Cleveland

You sealed with a kiss and you send it with Chanel
You lookin good in that one showin off your body
Had a Beverly Hills mami that would buy me Cardi's
Take me to after parties her name was Carrie
And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch I'm sorry
But, hey Kim how's Minneapolis?
You so pretty hate to show off your titties for silly classes
Cause I love you girls though you ain't mine
I wish my arms was long enough to hug you all of the same time

1837,1838,Digital Underground,The Humpty Dance,The Humpty Dance,Digital Underground,"Verse One: Humpty Hump (Shock G)

All right!
Stop whatcha doin'
'cause I'm about to ruin
the image and the style that ya used to.
I look funny,
but yo I'm makin' money, see
so yo world I hope you're ready for me.
Now gather round
I'm the new fool in town
and my sound's laid down by the Underground.
I drink up all the Hennessey ya got on ya shelf
so just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a Umpty.
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee.
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee.
I'm steppin' tall, y'all,
and just like Humpty Dumpty
you're gonna fall when the stereos pump me.
I like to rhyme,
I like my beats funky,
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy.
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
but sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat.
Look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from gettin' busy
I'm a freak
I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy.
Allow me to amaze thee.
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me.
I'm still gettin' in the girls' pants
and I even got my own dance

{Chorus:}
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Verse Two:

People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin""
that's all right 'cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
but ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B,
all the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really bein' sincere
'cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear.
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still gettin' paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge,
both how I'm livin' and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid,
I use a word that don't mean nothin', like looptid
I sang on Doowhutchalike, and if ya missed it,
I'm the one who said just grab 'em in the biscuits
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write.
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
and now I'm gonna do my dance.

{Chorus}

Breakdown:

Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

Verse Three:

First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'
Crazy wack funky
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
That's all right 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humpin', funkin', jumpin',
jig around, shakin' ya rump,
and when the dude a chump pump points a finger like a stump
tell him step off, I'm doin' my Hump.

{Chorus}

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doin' the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Let's get stoopid!

{Chorus}

Oh, yeah, come on and break it down

Outro:

Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world,
keep on doin' the Humpty Dance,
and to the ladies,
peace and humptiness forever

I'm on my grind, grand hustle
Got the mind and the muscle
50 carrats in the crown just to shine on you suckas
I still tote the Glock 40 for the haters and the bustas
Fuck probation, if a nigga try to play me I'ma bust him
Ion't need no security, reaching for my jewelry
Get you niggaz popped quick, filled full of hot shit
Fresh out the box Tip hot than a drop 6
Made a quarter mil' in the penn givin' stock tips
Haters wanna stop Tip, mad 'cus they not Tip
Ball every summer so your baby mama jock Tip
You don't no drama pimp, I promise I do not slip
Chrome 4-5th, hid well if the cops trip
Bought my girl a Hummer with the chrome right in front of dat

[Verse 2]
I know alota rappers don't like me, but they won't fight me
Feds swear I sell dope, well why they won't indict me?
Advances on the throne, I ain't never take it lightly
But all that tongue-wrestlin' hatin' while I'm gone don't excite me
How many rappers you know that could hold they own on Rice street
East steady talkin' on the cell phone nightly
Normal population, half the jail just like me
Polices think I'm crazy, scared a nigga gon' strike me
Contrarily, a nigga tryin' me is unlikely
They barkin' don't bother me, I'll be bombin' 'for they bite me
They just shocked to see my rap's exactly how my life be
Shiesty, with a conversation quite pricey
My fist so rocky and and wrist so icey
Might be, thrown off my rocker just slightly
Fiesty, claimin' hot temper don't ignite me
I'm only gonna ask ya find the exit once politely

My plan is to keep you atleast 2, levels under me where I need you
I'ma take advantage of my chance to defeat you
Your true colors done shown, now it's on when I see you
I'm grown nigga, so let it be know we ain't equal
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' I can't reach you
Beat you, to a fuckin' pulp if I need to
The very spot ya standin' in then is where I'll leave you
Seen on the scene white T and evisu's

Lookin hot in them heels, I think I want that

Bounce, baby feel the incline
So geniune, everytime, Busta redefine

Makin ya'll press rewind
Hope you feelin fine
Watch me combine and intertwine
The bounce rock skates make you cross the foul line
Shine a nickel nine
On all kinds of little swine
Stick the worst of porcupine
If you tryin to take mine
Yo, pick up my nigga Splif
In the blue 5S's
Sportin out tan, interior blue head restses
Move, baby no time for second guesses
Been articulate the right bounce as the flow finesses
Yo we gettin papers spreadin love and happiness's
Shit blazin so hot DJ's scratch the test presses
Like make it mo hot baby *chorus comes in*

Chorus:

Turn it up, I wanna hear it real loud, just
Turn it up, so we can party in the loft, baby
Turn it up, we need to tear the roof off, so just
Turn it up, I need to make it mo hot, baby

Yo, word is bond

Let me put it in your spirit like the holy Kyron

Sweet like honey chicken dijon

Yo, honey body look real strong
Watch your ass swing
Hangin like a medallion
Exercise baby let me see you spread on the floor
What you askin for?
Relax, I'm bout to give you some more
Where the liquor store?
Hit you with some more metaphor
The raw, hot to def shit you never seen it before
Hit the deck, on your mark, get set, we bout to jet
Spark it like ingelet, chickens breakin their neck
Yo we play to win
Such a shame, shit is a sin

Everytime I flow speak

Just like the body guard Les straight walkin the street

A lot of hot ones ready for niggas that act brave
Chill son, you better off if you behave
Flip money while broke niggas tryin to save
Lay low, I say so, my pesos
Import my cheese stack by the castros
Make clothes
Or stay fly a chase hoes
Equatorians soft lips and straight nose
Makin dough
When we rippin the paid show
Get the money and dip, we in the Range Rove
Now we makin grands
We name brand
We make plans, change plans
Then we expand across land
Do it properly
Yo, I said open sesame
The recipe, be the hot shit, it's got to be
Yo, landscape
We arrange a whole shape
Rock the fly tape
Then I continue to skyscrape

I gotta dedicate a rhyme to you girl c'mon, c'mon

I don't care where you're from
The first time that I saw you girl, you had me sprung
Just the way that my name rolls off your tongue
Damn near knocked all the wind out my lungs
Baby girl, you the one, you the maximum
You got every man diggin for scraps and crumbs (I CANT FRONT)
I want it all in one lump sum
But girl you got me sittin on my hands and thumbs (I AINT DONE)
Girl you got the magic touch
You seen every man now you passed him up -except one-
Baby girl that's whats up I CAN'T WAIT
For the thing when we hangin tough

I'm not sure what you did to me
But I like it, I love it -- Oh
I'm not sure what you did to me
But I like it, I love it -- Said

When God made you, y'know he made a work of art
Wanna be with you girl from the finish to the start
From dusk til dawn, from morning til dark (OH MY GOD)
Whenever we apart, its like a poison dart shot through my heart (REAL TALK)

Wanna drive it on home like a nail through wood

Wanna say so much, could you make a little time?
Girl you look so cute

In the Tahoe on 24's, I'm the truth, I got that glow
I'm out that Swisha House with Archie Lee and Couda Bang
Sittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame
You see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts

Slanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks
A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills
I'm in the club posted up with some gang bangers
Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank
Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Trying to find some ""Honey Love"" my macking game is top rank
These ho's peeping me, ill hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, trying to figure which car I drive
I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping
Look at that cold grill and woman
The trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped
I'm the undisputed king of the parking lot, I'm sittin' sideways

Sittin' sideways on them 24's
Watch ya ho, watch ya money, watch ya clothes

Motor like a snot nose
Suicide drop doors, mono blocks, chop mold
Customized deck, cause the mono block stock lows

Heads up when you see us, we gon' put it in ya face

Boys smell lemon haze, I ain't the nigga to settle
I'm that dude with the metal, that get hot as a kettle
From messing 'round with some cat that ain't got it together
Flossing, breaking of the intersection, crossing
Three-wheelin' acting a iz-ass on them Bosses

Tell the nigga one thing that you need yo space
Selling niggaz is one thing you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between yo knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you makin, get yo knees to shake

I gotta mansion and a gate, you wit me you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck wit 23's the case
600 Gz in the safe, how much cheese it take?

And it feel like faith, make a mistake
How the same thing making you say I'm making you stay

Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it yo chest
Take advantage of what your concealing in yo dress
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best
Compliment you on your hair and legs and treat you wit respect
Give you sex till you sweat, tongue kissing on yo neck
It's been awhile since she got it like this I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet

One day like the phoenix rose from the ashes
That a boy will be born unto a family in the slums
This boy will go on and use the knowledge that he gains
While fighting for survival in the streets
To become a great leader
And in time that boy will grow to become King!!!!!!

Time to ride nigga (Just Blaze!!)
I welcome you and get acquainted with the youngest in charge
Respected from East to West like he was running the mob
Dictating, ain't taking orders from no one but God
I know you niggaz is broke 'cause I know what you charge
Them niggaz wishing for a Phantom it's one in my garage
It's black as legary right next to the black Ferrari
You niggaz ain't getting money off of rapping I'm sorry
Fuck the rep went and spent 60 large on a Harley
'Cause where he stay 10,012 feet not hardly
Now you see that we ain't able to compete, now arewe?
And pardon me I'm giving you the Westside story
Of the A, where I stay and niggaz stay down for me
You want to play, have you gay niggaz lay down for me
And get a order for killers to spray rounds for me
Competition, you ain't considered; you rapping, you bore me
You reppin the A horribly
Must I say more importantly

You need to get familiar with Dope Boys and see where
all these niggaz got they style
See where that trap shit came from
Then you need to graduate to mother fucking In Da Streets Vol.1-3
Then you need to go to Trap Muzik, I got locked up for a second
Then grab Urban Legend and now to bring you up to speed

Who knew you could fit on your wrist a whole pound of diamonds
I'm number one on the list while you clowns are climbing
Wishing to be in positions that you found that I'm in
Since you niggaz do what it say I'm world renowned than sign me
If Jay handled the clay and around the time
I delivered a bad day when 4 5's were spiraling
I care the least about police and the fireman siren
Ambulance ain't gon stand a chance in reviving
DOA amend the beef will cease upon my arriving
Paramedics yell clear and your flat line silent
You ain't ready for out here 'cause the lifestyle violent
You think you is, you must be living on Fantasy Island
Your mammies mad, get your ass wiped out like Thailand
Hit my phone and got what left and hit the three while you following
You say you want to release and go to war with the finest
Need you be reminded, want it with Your Highness?

Ay man I know y'all niggaz still in the trap everyday
Still man I know y'all don't see nothing but the projects nothing but grits

And come see 'bout niggaz you understand

[Verse 1:]
In some secluded rendezvous
That overlooks the avenue
He stepped into the streets and walked up to this girl
He had a cap tooth made of gold
He had an earing in his nose
And her looks, that a night he liked to twirl
And he says:
�I love the way you look at me, I love your smile
Why don't you come and talk to me just for a while?
Give me your love, oohhh give me your love
Why don't you come and talk to me, give me your love?
And we can move it like this�

Aaahhhhhhh (baby thats a what I like)

[Verse 2:]
And now the hours go by fast
And memories come from the past
As he tells the girl the story of his life
You see a long long time ago
He fell in love, but let her go
And if he had the chance again, she'd be his wife
And he sings to her nightly, he says
�Lydia, oh Lydia, I wish I didn't get ridda ya
Lydia I miss your rose tatoo
There's some things I can't forget
Oh hunny why did I dis ya? (you can learn alot from Lydia)
I gotta move it like this�

[Verse 3:]
Now take a cup and walk away
To this secret hideaway
And our lonely man is at a loss for words
She says �How far do you want to go?�
He says �How far is to Moreau?�
And when they make love, this is all that can be heard
Silence, and then you hear
Aye aye aye aye aye, make sweet love to me
Aye aye aye aye aye, give me ecstacy
Aye aye aye aye aye, make sweet love to me
Give me all those things I miss
But start is off with a kiss
And move a little something like this

My thoughts are thundering tumblin
Sons of bitches switches from yelling ta mumbling
You ain't a pal of me my family ties but not wit Mallory
My analogy ain't for salary as I roll reality thru galaxies
Four centuries it's sent to me with the scent of oiu
Witta chain representing penitentiaries
from Roman town to Borentown
From Newark to Illtown
And all you know from
lifers, Rikers ta foesome
Wasn't driving to fast, I was flying to low
You think I'm rocking too quick, I think you're listening to slow
I'm abrupting construction, a pumping assumption
You diss while your family say I'm the best shit since fucking
Struckin 'bout an obstruction or turning something of nothing
From more things to more things, it's the rip in every function
Funking it up, pumping it up, chumping the ducks
Looking ta hump Ms. Junk in the trunk, pump pumpin me up

My lyrics be laced with 40 ounces of funk and stuff, you get rushed, you

You call yourself callin my bluff, enough's enough
I'm puttin it down on the real end
This one goes out to all the people who be questioning
my skills, niggas I been rockin since lee twillz
and we feel that we build careers of steel
So all the rest come up and test but only stress is what you'll find
thinkin
Vinnie don't write and Vinnie can't rhyme shrinkin
The sleepin MC I eat like good 'n' plenty
Lyrically spankin ya that's why they call me Uncle Vinnie
And oh yes, I just appeal to the masses
young to old folks, the upper, lower, middle classes
They don't begin wit no lying professor
they begin when Vin pick up the pen and pad up off the dresser
Lesser, a man should never challenge a clan
wit thirteen years experience of rippin mic's put in our hands

Verse 3: Treach
I got barbarians to bogard me in
at a club that barred me when
a broad got thrown like barbarnigan born again, thrown aboard

Da boots word ta-burr-bam-boo break the loot
Blowing up brain cells BOOM like Beirut

Gives last name ain't Suzuki but still my sidekick
Whip that hide quick if ya slide quick, blood clot ya Blood clique

Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under
Their noses, I hate those motherfuckin posers

And with my unique skills nag you can't compare me
And no we don't make wack tracks

Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it

2571,2572,Ice-T,Colors,Colors,Ice-T,"I am a nightmare walking, psychopath talking
King of my jungle just a gangster stalking
Living life like a firecracker quick is my fuse
Then dead as a deathpack the colors I choose
Red or Blue, Cuz or Blood, it just don't matter
Suckers dive for your life when my shotgun scatters
We gangs of L.A. will never die - just multiply

You see they hit us then we hit them
Then we hit them and they hit us, man
It's like a war, ya know what I'm sayin'
People dont even understand
They don't even know what they dealing with
You wanna get rid of the gangs it's gonna take a lotta work
But people don't understand the size of this
This is no joke man, this is real

You don't know me, fool
You disown me, cool
I don't need your assistance, social persistance
Any problem I got I just put my fist in
My life is violent but violent is life
Peace is a dream, reality is a knife
My colors, my honour, my colors, my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
Tell me what have you left me, what have I got
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My home boy got jacked
My mother's on crack
My sister can't work cause her arms show trax
Madness insanity live in profanity
Then some punk claimin' they understandin' me
Give me a break, what world do you live in
Death is my sect, guess my religion

Yo my brother was a gang banger
and all my homeboys bang
I don't know why I do it man, I just do it
I never had much of nuffin man
Look at you man, you've got everything going for yourself
and I ain't got nuffin man, I've got nuffin
I'm living in the ghetto man
just look at me man, look at me

My pants are saggin braided hair
suckers stare but I don't care
my game ain't knowledge my game's fear
I've no remorse so squares beware

But my true mission is just revenge
you ain't in my sect, you ain't my friend
wear the wrong color your life could end
homocides my favorite binge

Listen to me man
no matter whatcha do don't ever join a gang
you don't wanna be in it man,
You're just gonna end up in a mix of dead freinds and time in jail I
know, if
I had a chance like you,
I would never be in a gang man
but I didn't have a chance
You know I wish i did

I'll just walk like a giant police defiant
you'll say to stop but I'll say that I cant
my gangs my family its all that I have
I'm a star, on the walls is my autograph

You don't like it, so you know where you can go
cause the streets are my stage and terror's my show
phsyco-analize tried diognising me wise
It wasn't your brother that brutaly died

But it was mine, so let me define
my territory don't cross the line
Don't try to act crazy
cause shit don't faze me
if you ran like a punk
it wouldn't amaze me
cause my colors death
thou we all want peace
but our war won't end,
till all wars cease.

See the wars of the street gangs will always get to me man
But I don't wanna be down with this situation man
but I'm in here, if I had something betta to do I think I'd do it but
right
now I'm just down here boye
I'm trying to get money cause I'm smart
I'm gunna get paid while I'm out here
I'm gunna get that paper, ya know what I'm saying
If I had a chance like you,
maybe I would be in school
but I'm not, I'm out here living day to day surviving
and I'm willing to die for my colors

Yo'll please stop, cause I want ya all to live.

Like all the doubts When love sent shivers down my spine

And what's come over me
Are chills of another kind

One emotion wrapped around me
One emotion I can hold on to
Wherever it's going is exactly where I want to be
One emotion's got a hold of you and me

There's nothing left Of the useless things I used to feel
Only love now As everything else just fades away
It's all around us

It's just as real as the wild horses
You would have to have to drag me away

Want tips by the clock

And settle for crumbs and croutans
I'm out for armored bucks and armored trucks, with armed killas
Bitch niggas get swallowed by the armadillos
Ain't no harmin me, the army full honary niggas you can't see
So while you pace bitches and saturns livin jenky

This is why I’m hot
I don't gotta rap
I can sell a mil sayin nothin on the track
I represent New York
I got it on my back
In this state that we lost
So I’mma bring it back
I love the dirty dirty
Cuz homies show me love
The ladies start to bounce
As soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest
They love to take it slow
So when I hit the club
I watch them get it on the floor
And if you need it hyphy
I take it to the bay
Frisco to Sac town
They do it any day
Coppin a Hollywood
As soon as I hit LA
I’m in that low low
I do it the cali way
And when I hit the Chi
People say that I’m fly
They love the way I dress they like
They like my my attire
They love how I move crowds from side to side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply

This is why I’m hot
Catch me on the block
Every other day
Another person another drop
16 bars, 24 pop, 44 songs
Gimme what you got
I’m in there driving cars
Push them off the lot
I’m into shutting stores down so I can shop
If you need a bird I can get it chopped
Tell me what you need you know I get ‘em by the flock
I call my hommie black meet me on the ave
I hit wash heights with the money in the bag
we into big spinners
See my pimping never dragged
Find me with different women that you people never had
For those who say they know me know I’m focused on my cream
Playa you come between you’d better focus on the beam
I keep it so clean the way you see me lean
And when I say I’m hot my homie this is what I mean

(Chorus)

Verse 3:
This is why I’m hot
Shorty see the drop
Ask me what I paid and I say yeah I paid a guap
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way they call me cream of the crop
They hop in the car
I tell them all about
We hit the studio they say they like the way I record
I gave you black train and I did you wrong
So everytime I see them and they tell me that’s their song
They say I’m the bomb
They love the way the charm hanging from the neck
And compliments the arm which compliments the ear then comes the gear
So when I hit the room the shorties stop and stare
Then homies start to hate rearrange their face
Little do they know I keep them things by waist side
I reply nobody gotta die
Similar to lil weez cuz I got the fire

business as I kick up the treble tone
on my radio tape player box, right
just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see ?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating
investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease
until a group of brothers started bugging out
drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
holding their crotches and being obscene
At first I ignored them cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
and they see a young couple having a time that's good
and their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do
and the loud bright colors that I wear [Boo !]
I was a target cause I'm a fashion misfit
and the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggaz leave me be
but they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me ?
Cause if I start to hit this man they'll have to kill me

[CHORUS:]
I am everyday people (2x)

I told the niggaz please let us pass, friend
I said please cause I don't like killing Africans
but he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
but I had to take the brother out for being rude
and like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African

That I think it won't take too long
Maybe it's because I can see you laughing
That I think you've got it wrong
Maybe I could be like Robin Hood
Like and outlaw dressed all in green
Someone said what's he gonna turn out like
And someone else said never mind
Well I was big and bold and more than twice as old
As all the cats I'd ever seen
I grew my hair and bought a suit
Of shiny white or was it cream
I shook and shivered danced and quivered
And stood on a mountain top

No one came from miles around and said
Man your music is really hot

Well I knew what they meant because I was a freak
My throat was tired and worn
My pretty face just looked out of place
As they poured on the scorn
I wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the king
He said my boy we'll have some crazy scenes
There weren't any scenes at all like he was talkin' about
He must've been the king of queens
Well I could write a million songs about the things I've done
But I could never sing them so they'd never get sung
There's a law for the rich and one for the poor and there's another one for singers
It's die young and live much longer
Spend your money and sit and wonder

No one came for miles around
And said man your music is really funky

I believe that I must tell the truth
And say things as they really are
But if I told the truth and nothing but the truth
Could I ever be a star
Nobody knows who's real and who's fakin'
Everyone's shouting out loud
It's only the glitter and shine that gets through
Where's my Robin Hood outfit
Well I've come and I've gone before you wink an eye
No one ever cared enough to say goodbye
The money's good and the time you have
Fun and games galore
But you spend your money and lie in bed forgotten
And you wonder what you did it for

From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you be harmed
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough?
Against wrong, choose right and be standin up
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just to get the car-seat in right
People drivin' all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your basonette
That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
Cause I knew I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you

Wait an see gonna be tall
Makes me laugh cause you got your dad's ears an all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be
A General, a Doctor, maybe a MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, trudat
Uh-uh-uh why you do that?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can
Show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor an
I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
An you can cry, ain't no shame in it
It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove
You was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back

Verse 3:

It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM
See me-I'm
Tryin to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nuthin' promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust life does go on
But just in case
It's my place
To impart
One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams come true

Clap your hands everybody, if you got what it takes
Cos I'm KRS and I'm on the mic, and Premier's on The Breaks

Verse 1

If you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper,
girls go Illlll!
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, that's to leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or natty dread
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember You Must Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player
But make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer

Verse 2

This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it

Verse 3

Some MC's don't like the KRS but they must respect him
Cos they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
Just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine?
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tangle with the likes of these
Cross your t's and dot your i's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like artefacts
On the wrong side of the tracks, electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
As I spark mad iszm
The 1996 lyrical style's what I give 'em",krs-one

Trying to get into my building
Thinking, ""Why in the heck won't somebody kill them?""

They vowed that no one would ever
Come on our block, and terrorize us

You shook, cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cop's control
They better have the riot gear ready

by the mac one-double, I touch you
and leave you with not much to go home wit

if I'm not at home, puffin lye relaxin

So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul, before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
And to the drama I built, and all unfinished beef
You will soon be killed, put us together
It's like mixin vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin, takin my enemies with me
and if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me

[Havoc]
I'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin to get dough y'know
When the dough get low the jewels go, but never that
As long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin countin my stacks
No doubt, watchin my back and proceed with caution
Five-oh lurkin, no time to get lost in -- the system
Niggaz usin fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I-llegal world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged, that fucked me up God
But shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples when you're upstate bleedin
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid witchu
Hit wit a 2 to 4 it's difficult
Wild on the streets I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, cause hoes like to run game
Some niggaz like to trick but I ain't wit that trickin shit
I'm like a Jew, savin dough so I can big whip
Pushin a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get I'm stayin in the projects, forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never seperate and pull together
When worse comes to worse and my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot
Fuck lookin cute, I'm strictly Timb boots and army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin the smell
In the Bridge gettin down it ain't hard to tell
You better realize

Low profile, rap style

every time we cover them grounds
still surviving but there's a few down
back in the essence

with jail adolescence
crying confession, the system's supplying the pressure
my mind is guessing
Is living and dying a lesson
but not to be obliged with the mirage
of cars taking you off track
from with the gods focus on hard
Laid up smoking cigars
motioning maids to bring me toast and eggs
kosher, Ice chokers and wolves to smoke ya
my wisdom culture lives in ultra madness
devoted coach bag bitch
broke the average nigga's hopes to get mad rich
But what's the purpose
only the gods can watch the Earth twist

pushed my luck
yo they had a brother put in cuffs
Luckily, made it out of court comfortably
judge said I need a job ain't nothing coming free
could've got a one to three

but they can't see
From life to death
so know we back to where we never left the ghetto
It's a damn shame


knowing it's a man's game
shorty thinks it's time to make ya plans change
all that running round trying to chase
what's already here - been there
it's going no where
pops told me knuckle up - no fear
I wish some of these killings
they could be prevented

subtract the weak links about the chaining
rise it start raining
Blasphemy using Nas name in vain
some plain supreme being
yet they lied in his name
I tried to learn the game
and the only thing I found incredible
everything I tried to learn
see, I already knew
And it's embedded in my heart now
so I can sit back, count a stack
and play my part now
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
he wore disguise
put a gun to me hungry he
went on to chastize
That's Nas ain't it
made it rich from entertainment
fresh wally's painted
as he told the kid he came with
my first thought was how the game flip
Yo perhaps it was somebody I smacked
drunk in a party on yak
or was I marked for a contract
for some foul act
a little while back or beyond that
you got me laying face flat
saying my grace black
woke up in a cold sweat

[Marvin Gaye]
Music is the soul of the man
Music makes a, happy day
Music makes a, cloud flow by baby
Your music is my tears in-side my eyes (just like music)
Your music makes me want to sing
Girl music, is a joy to bring (just like music)
Music is my heart and soul, more precious than gold
(Turn on some music, I got my music)
Happiness for days, justice all the way
(Turn on some music, I got my music)
I love your music baby (I got my music)
(Turn on some music, I got my music - just like music)

Cuz my bills coming too soon,
My son gone be two soon,
Royalty checks come like once in a blue moon,
But I'm getting my dough from doing shows,
I made more dough on the grind than going gold,
That's why I stay fly I'm flogin' on hoes,
Flossin' so cool in a austin no shoes,
Just a rubberband on my wrist no jewels,
I ain't got to prove I'm rich, I'm no fool,
I know the rules and I got time for it,
But the nigga will shine when it's time for it,
And they will hate you deal with the real cake,
And they on the corner from morning till real late,

[Verse 3]

To get paid you got saved dont be spending the change,
In 5th grade i was hustling my genesis games,
I was dumb young, selling chewing gum to my classmates,
On the cash chase, moving at a fast pace,
Never been a dummy, never did what the dummys do,
So I had to mil to burn before I turned twenty two,
More money more problems is true,
Cuz the more money I make the more problems for you,
Yeah I use dude voice, props to the boy sean,
He made it a hot line, I made it a hot song,
So stop drawn man you gotta respect it,
I'm the best swizz got it perfected,
Dont mess with C-A double S-I-D-Y,
Cuz I became the best when B-I-G died,
The kid do it big like P-U-N,
Cuz I'm nice like P-A-C with the P-E-N end

First time I caught her s***, she ain't even know how to throw it back,
Now she an animal, I got her s** game right,

&amp; opened her up &amp; showed her what a real dude like,
I told her I don't usually do this, I don't f*** on the first night,
cause after I beat ya baby I'm liable To mess up ya whole life,
I gotta train her, now she s*** me with ice,

somethin' real smooth
you can just ride to
tell me how you feel
here we go...
The day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright
Went to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight
I was loced out Kris Kross shirts and khakis
Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac
See the bell rang and I got my dash
Fellin' good cause it was the last day of school and I passed
No moms trippin' so me and my mom went dippin'
To celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'
The downtown scene was packed
People screamin' from they ride to my ride and to the Mac
I says ""What I am is what I am is who I be""
And yall should have seen how they was tryin' to get to me
Cool, cause dissin' and no pay
They're the reason why we are who we are to this very day
And all that love keeps me and Chris tight
Long as we give some love back everything's alright.

Now everything feels alright when I'm rollin' through my hood
And I see the one that used to do the dirt then turned good
Little kids try to be like me with the braids, the shades, some pants,
and some Nikes, G
And yet more letters, and the letters sayin'
""I'm your number one fan could you write me back man?""
Yesssss.....
I try to pass 'em my autograph
I try to do as many as I can
Now it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood
Ain't nobody dissin' and a nigga thinks he's too good
Cause I'm down like four flat tires
Just a little nappy headed kid from the proj.
Showin' I can do right and not do wrong
Rappers and the Beejees comin' up strong
And we ain't got no love for the side
We only love those who love us back
Right?

Now people seem to think what I do is a blast
Cause I'm always on the road and I'm makin' some cash
But they don't know
Really know
The pressure it is for some kids tryin to make it in this here biz
Early mornin' interviews then we step to school
Step from school
Back to interviews then it's on to other dues
So, warm it up Chris

That's what I was born to do
Now throw your hands in the air and wave from side-to-side
If the feelin' thatcha feelin' is the feelin' of pride
See, I ain't come out wack I come out right
Unlike those 'mose who tried to pass the mike
It's the Daddy Mac
Big thing
Everything is real but you wanna dis cause a nigga sold a couple mill.
Look here, ya can't say nothin' if ya last in a line
So when you dis it just lets me know I'm on your mind

Nigga we from the Bronx, New York... shit happens,
Kids clappin' love to spark the place,
Half the niggas on the squad got a scar on they face,
It's a cold world, and this is ice,
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga this is life.
Got the phantom in front building Trinity Ave.
10 years been legit they still figure me bad.
As a youngin', I was too much to cope with.
Why you think, mo'fuckers nick-named me, Cook Coke shit.
Should've been called Don robbery, extorsion or maybe grand larceny...
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle,
This long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble.
Came out the gate, no I didn't flow Joe shit.
Fat nigga with shotty was the logo kid.

Said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up the pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.
I said my niggas don't dance,
See we just pull up the pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.

M to the whizz-i [Y],

The Don's stay fizz-i,
Got a date at 8, the day I was in the 740'fizz-i,
And I just bought a bike so I can ride til' I die,
With a matchin' jacket,
Bout' to cop me a mansion,
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'.
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance- we boogie,
So nevermind how we got in here with the burners and hoodies.
Listen we don't pay admission,
And bouncers don't check us,
And we walk around the metal detectors.
And there really ain't no need for a VIP section in the middle of the dance floor,
Reckless, check it, said it?!
Like my necklace, started relaxin' now, that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction.
See, money ain't a thing nigga, we still the same nigga, flows just changed
now we 'bout to change the game nigga.

Said my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up the pants and,
Do the Roc-away.

Now we livin' better now,
Gucci sweater now,
And that G4 could fly through, any weather now,
See niggas get tight, when you worth some millions.
That's why I sport the chincilla to hurt they feelin's.
Your can find Joe Crack at all type of shit,
Out at Vegas front roll on all the fights and shit,
If I visited Compton, they'd prolly squeel.
'Cause half these rappers dead broke like dirick fa' real.
If you cross the line damn right, I'm gon' hurt you,
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercials.
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up,
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up.
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about rucker,
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the rucker,
Not even Pee-Wee Kirkland could imagine this,
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship.

my niggas don't dance,
we just pull up the pants and,
Do the Roc-away.
Now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back.

Thirty six twenty four thirty eight pretty fine brown
Bad lil broad I ain't seen her in a minute
Since the All-Star game and I'm still tryin to hit it
Got a baby for this nigga that I used to sell things
He caught a fed case and he ain't leave her no change
She sold all his jewels she sold all his cars
Now she dancing in the shaker club stripping for the stars
Sliding down the pole slow drop it to a split
Pussy popping on a handstand man she the shit
She still looking tight though
Still built right though
Run my game right and after the club
She might go back to the telly with me
Shake her jelly with me
Let my people bust on her face and her belly with me
I got Lil Webbie with me and he ain't hating
We some players in this bitch so baby stop hesitating

[Chorus - repeat 4X]
Girl give me that pussy
Girl give me that
Girl give me girl give me that there

[Lil Webbie] - Verse 3
Now I can tell from your size that that pussy is fire
So I'm here and willing to give you whatever it require
For you to lay down on your back and then open your thighs
Long sharp deep and wide have you rolling your eyes
You a big fine horse I had no choice but to try it
Look like it's worth a couple g's but ain't some shit I buy
Let me whisper in your ear again I ain't gon lie
I might share a lil meal just don't tell nobody
Look you know you want it
Girl don't act like you don't want it
Girl you want it just as bad as I do
But check this out
You gon be wishing that you been gave me your money
By the time I finish rumbling with you
While rhymes get loose let's take this shit to the room
And you just keep yourself excited til we get to the room
Cuz I've been rocked up since I met you
I'm ready to give you the blues
Don't stunt now take off your shoes
Don't act confused you know what time it is

[Chorus - repeat 4X]
Girl give me that pussy
Girl give me that
Girl give me girl give me that there",webbie featuring bun b

Standing there with my nappy hair and my dirty gear, awww yeah

5218,5219,Crucial Conflict,Hay,Hay,Crucial Conflict,"Sittin on a quarter 'p of hay
Thangs is feelin good today.
I'm tore up,from the floor up
Sippin on some crown royal.
Trippin,in a circle of wood
Where everybody smoke they own bud.
Good ole' hay
How you feel today?
Fine,blowed and dandy.
Silly like i'm hype off candy.
Gotta big,thick chic named sandy.
In the farm in the middle of the barn
Where everybody's feelin crazy.
I went to visit granny's house.
Now i see why don't nobody leave.
We constantly,constantly,constantly smokin b's.
Too blitzed to even shake it off
But i still got my head up.
Coldhard finna go in the back of the barn
And get my big black peter sucked
Pass the hay you silly slut,
Blaze it up so i can hit that bud.
Git me zoned and i'll be on.
Cuz i love to smoke upon hay.

(chorus)
Smokin on
Haaayy in the middle of the barn.
Smokin on
Haaayy in the middle of the barn.

The hay got me goin through a stage
And i just can't get enough.
Smokin everyday
I got some hay
And you know i'm finna roll it up.
Make a cloud
I'm gonna take my mind away from all the
Bullcrap.
Bump my sounds
Lay back and roll
Mack to the freaks that's on the road.
Sometimes i wonder
When i was blowed on the streets.
Anybody wanna step to me,
I'ma see how rough they be.
In this session,manifesting
On myp's and q's
Never snooze cause i refuse.
Inhale,exhale the smell.
Smokin hay all by myself.
Wildstle,laughin loud.
Wit my homies by my side.
If somethin jump off let it ride
On my square when time is live.
Everybody throw it up
Go to the barn and get some hay.
When i get my choke on.
Fool you know i'm smokin on......

Hay now hay
We smokin up hay in the middle of the barn
And i'm lit up
Can't get up
My eyes are red
And my head is spinnin.
Took another pull
Ridin red bull
Got the goofies, can't stop grinnin.
Got a posse full of hoes playin in my braids
And we bout to get in em.
Over yonder is the barn where the pals be at
And everything funny.
Gotta pause some nigga tryin' to blow my high
Smokin all that hay with no money.
Now truly this bitch wanna do me
So i hit the 151bacardi
She high like the sun
Thick like cornbread,and i'm ready to party.
That hay got me so gotdamn horny
But i don't like that tramp.
The only reason I'm poppin that coochie
cause the hoe had a book of foodstamps.
And i got the munchies
I need soul food.
Collard greens or pinto beans.
If you smoke hay like the conflict do,
Then you know what the hell i mean.

(chorus)

Rollin down the block
Car full of flies and the flies tried to rise up out dat dorr crack.
Got my niggas in the barn smokin on that
Hay stack
Back up on the scene from smokin herb,
I creeped up on the wall and all i heard.
Was a bud of mine who dropped a needle in
The hay
With a funky dime word.
Couldn't be myself
Couldn't smoke wit nobody else
If i didn't pass it to the left.
Nigga would have lost my breath.
Open up the window 'fore i fall and faint
But i can't
Cause i roll around in dat barn ride.
Rollin up the hootie hoo
Roughest skin roller on dat west side.
Nigga come on in
I got some hay
Won't you close dat barn door
Nigga what you let them flies out for?
Ain't nobody to rich, we poor.
Lettin all the contact smoke up in the barn
The flies keep us chokin.
Thank you jesus christ
For all the hay you're givin us
Cause we'll keep on smokin'.

Hush baby, wanna let ya know
This is how its gonna go

[beat starts up]

[Chorus - 7 Aurelius]
Hush baby, wanna let ya know
This is how its gonna go
If u wanna come and play
Gotta do it my way
Hush baby, dont talk so much
Just wanna feel ya touch
Everything will be ok
If u do it my way (my way, my way)
Hush baby [echoes]

[Verse 1 - LL Cool J]
U feel so good
Rest of my life i wish i could
Hold u tight and take a flight out the hood
Was i foul or just misunderstood?
Mind-mannered or up to no-good
It really doesnt matter, either way i should
Maximize the moment and hold ya close
Jump in the drop spider and cruise down the coast
Who loved u the most?
I was never ghost
When lives was on the line
Confusion in ya mind
Runnin outta time
Drama of all kind
But theres faith in our mind
We spiritually inclined
Sometimes i flip
Sometimes u flip
Sometimes we wild out and act like lunatics
We movin too fast, the whole world's in a rush
Everybody just hush...

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 2 - LL Cool J]
Its all a test; the pain, the drama
The villa in the bahamas
The highs, the lows
The hoop-t, the Rolls
The money flowin
Certain doors that we go in
The people we meet, the hands that we shake
Whether its Mortans or Sizzla steak
But everything will be okay
[w/ 7 Aurelius] if we do it my way
Cuz i believe in romance
Kissin while ya slow dance
Me bouncin baby? no chance
No matter the circumstance
Whatever it takes gurl, ill swim to France
Cuz ya beauty's unmatched
Such a great catch
Unconditional love, forever we are attatched
Deal with the drama, we can find our way back
With or without the Maybach...

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 3 - LL Cool J]
I can feel ya pain
Like we simese twins connected by our brains
Walkin thru the desert in the ice cold rain
Want u in my life and nothins gonna change
God willin, we still be doin our thang
When my six-pack's faded
Raps outdated
But thats many years from now so dont rush
Little mama just hush...

[Chorus x1]

[7 Aurelius]
Hush baby
Hush hush darling
Hush baby hush hush
Dont talk so much
Wanna feel ya touch

Nastier than a full grown German Shepherd; motherfucker keep steppin
They don't fuck with me and they don't

Pay ya fare, fix ya hair, throw that pussy
Got Prada for my boonapalist, and (??) from Debussy(??)
You think I'm trickin? Bitch, I ain't trippin

Drinkin Henn and actin like it do somethin to me
Hope this indecent proposal make you do somethin with me
Fuck a dollar girl, pick up fifty

I'm chillin with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
and my man Op', you know he's dope (yo)
But right now y'know we just maxin in the studio
We hailin from East Oakland, California and, um
sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill

[1]
Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a forty, swig it, y'know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali; gettin weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration

[2]
I get inspired by the blunts too (too)
I'll front you (you) if you hang with a bunk crew (chump)
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm done; take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this (nahh)
A-Plus is famous - so get the anus!

[3]
Hey miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight
You look great - let's grub now
A rub down sounds flavor; later there's the theatre
We in the gut, the cinema, was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

[4]
Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
close range, I throws game at your dip like handball
cause the man's all that
All fat - I be the chill from 93 'til

[Chorus: S.O.M.]
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til

Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill, from 93 'til

This is how we chill.. from 93 'til

[5]
Huh, my black Timbs do me well (yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (what?)
another person's business, I cause dizzyness
Until you - stop acting like a silly bitch

[6]
Yo, crews are jealous cause we get props
The cops, wanna stop - our fun, but the top
is where we're dwellin, swell and fat, no sleep
I work fit and jerks get their hoes sweeped
under their noses, this bro's quick
yo hit blunts and flip once I'm chillin cause my crew's close, kid

[7]
I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit, cause I'm an exception to the rule
I'm steppin - to the cool spots where crews flock to snare a dip
or see where the shit that's flam B
Blam leakin out his pocket
So I got tons of indo and go to the hoe in's
basement, my ace spent
Fattenin up tracks, Time to get prolific with the whiz kid

[8]
Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
who got the fat sacks we can max pumpin fat tracks
Exchangin facts about impacts, cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers brothers can't hack.. it
They lack wit; we got the mack shit
93 'Til Infinity - kill all that wack shit

[Chorus]
Hah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill.. from 93 'til
Yeahhh this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill, from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 until
This is how we chill from 93 'til

[9]
I be coolin; school's in session but I'm fresh in
rappin so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit with my own click
Roll many back roads with a fat stog' and blunt, folding runts
Holding stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber, zestin
Niggaz is testin my patience; but I stay fresh and

[10]
Restin at the mall, attendance on 'noid
But I am shoppin for my wish to exploit
some cute fits, some new kicks
I often do this cause it's the pits not bein dipped

[11]
Flip - the flyer attire females desire
Baby you can step to this if you admire
The ex..traordinary dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main squeeze before I tap her

[12]
I'll mack her; attack her with the smoothness
I do this, peepin what my crew gets (huh)
loot, props, respect and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face they kiss my ass (smak!)
They bite flows but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't ya signed yet?
But I get - my loot from Jive/Zomba, I'ma bomb ya
You will see - from now 'til infinity

[Chorus]
Ah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill, from 93 'til
Huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
Yo, this is how we chill, from 93 'til
Aww yeah this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Yeah this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how.. we chill, from 93 'til

[Outro]
Hah-hah, just coolin out, y'know what I'm sayin
But, but who's chillin around the land y'know?
Yo, who's chillin? I think I know who's chillin
Yeah tell me who's chillin then then Plus

In my apartment I begged her please stop it

And that girl ain't nothing but a crab
Educated no stupid yep

I'm not James at 15 or Chachi in charge
I'm Adam and I'm adamant about living large
With the white sassoons and the looks that kill
Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville then
I met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie
I liked the little cutie but I kicked her in the bootie
Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
You be listening to my records' a number one sound
Just step to the rhythm step step to the ride

Tune in tune on to my tune that's live

She'll show you a good time then she'll show you the door
Break up with your girl it ended in tears
Vincent Van Gogh go and mail that ear
Call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin'
The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinkin'
Said come on over it was me that she missed
I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed
Your old lady left you and you went (girls girls girls) insane
You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 train well...
Take my advice at any price a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak man
Sucking down pints till I didn't know
Woke up in the morning at the one Ton Ho
Cause I announce I like girls that bounce
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
Girls with curls and big long locks
And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks
Walking high and mighty like she's number one
*She thinks she's the passionate one*

And consider ridin she'll kick the blahzay spleen
Plus, you got a man but he ain't quite me
The type of man that try to give you what you need
And, he wanna know where you are where you be
Where you going where you today where you started to be (Damn)
If I was him I wouldn't even leave
I would trust you what you say that you are where you been
Say, he the type of nigga that's still cheap
Take his girl on a date and they go to Mickey D's

Try to take you out to see things and occasionally creep

Don't sound too good it sound tainted to me

Scandal love, cause love full of scandal
Too much chick for that ass she couldn't handle that
Well it's the same tainted love in the music business
People they lose thet brain just to get up in this
Let's be a star for day, everything in life is just ok
People say things they don't really wanna say
Hey but it's ok cause your a star for the day
People a smile at you when they really wanna frown
Well a that's just the way tainted folk get down
Just keep it real and, we'll see
When the situation is tainted love is always free
Love is always free love is always free

You say you love me but is it really real
Would you, fix me green tea if I'm feelin ill
Would you, give me a back rub to sooth after a long day
Dinner by candlelight but your the main entree
And if so I do the same with other treats to give you
Trailin rose pedals from your door to beneath your pillow
With a bucket of champagne on your night stand

How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
(It's like I can't believe you gone)
My best friend's gone
(Sometimes I feel like I can't go on)
And I'm so all alone
(Everytime I see something you done left
I really miss my homies
(It just remind me, more and more of you, dawg)
Even though they gone away
(I just keep reminiscin)
I know you in a better place
(Cause I know you alright)
And I hope to see ya soon someday

[Pimp C]
We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys
But I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy
Off in the club smokin weed til 3, hollerin at the hoes
Spendin $4000 on me on gators and clothes
When I turned to rap, he had to chase the game
Nigga told me, ""C, leave that dope, cause rappin is yo thang""
I ain't gone even lie, some nights I ride and cry
Wonderin why the real niggas always the ones to die
So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind
I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time
I wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs
For all the niggas in the game that be sellin keys
I keep my memories, try to keep my head strong
But baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone

[Sons, Mo B. O'dell]
Even though you gone away
(Even though you gone, you ain't never gon be forgotten)
I know you in a better place

You gon live through me and other TRU playas)

Even though they gone away

I'm just sittin here dazed thinkin bout all the times we had
Thinkin the past, some was good and some was bad
Remember Dante?
It was a group of us, just a group of five
Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive
To all my soldiers before me, may ya'll rest in peace
When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies
He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me
Wishin I could rewind time like demos
Me and you gettin girls, writin down numbers like memos
Makin million dollar bets, makin all our money stretch like limos
Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry
But if I close my eyes and visualize me together
Then I suddenly wanna smile
To see you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up
You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us
Even though you was wrong, I never could belive that that was true
You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos
See me and C and P forever gon be ridin and thuggin
Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it
And rest in peace to my brother
We gon miss you

(I love these fools)
I know you in a better place
(Every time I get on my knees)
And I hope to see ya soon someday

Ain't no more fights, and ain't no more tears)","master p featuring silkk the shocker, sons of funk and mo b. dick"

Sittin at the ghetto thinkin bout
All my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!)
Candy painted cadillacs and triple gold
That's how me and my boys rolled
How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me

I used to hang with my boy even slang with my boy
Used to bang with my boy, goddam I miss my boy
We started out youngstas in the park throwin birds
In your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt
The game got me workin, got me perkin, never jerkin
Still blowin dolja fo ya cause I know you up there workin
Ya little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight
But today's a sad day to see the t-shirt with ya face
From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall
In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall
In the projects you's a legend on the street you was a star
But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin in that black car
A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried
You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire
Why soldiers ride for yo name leave it vain
Some Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change

Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
In the hills where the trees grow wild with weed fields
The fucking pigs with shields holding the blue steels
Greenhouse effect with the weed connect
(Doctor) DEA can't keep Greenthumb in check (Doctor!)
HPS, God Bless the whole crop
Please God, don't let me see no cops
Trunkload, ready to hit the highway
Don't let the eye in the sky fly my way
or we gonna have big trouble, that's no shit
Can't be growin without no permit
but fuck that, I study the 215 trip
That way when they come they can suck my dick
Weed can't grow without attention

People can't live without the herb man
If not they'd be drinkin and drivin and swervin
but thanks to Dr. Greenthumb weed grow
in the backyard or inside with hydro
To the cush plant brushin a tangerine dream
Tasty, blowin a fuckin smokescreen
Cycles of weed are constantly grown
Somebody give me the razor to cut groves
I'd like to stop, but it feels so good
Horny plants stinkin up my whole neighborhood
Sticky angel, I wanna leave it alone
but never ever ever got a warrant for my home
What that funny sound knockin at the door (Open up it's the DEA!)
Sorry Greenthumb can't talk no more
Please don't follow me into the sun
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Chorus 1/2

[B-Real]
Out from the lab, no need for rehab
If I can't drive then call me a cab (ese!)
In my closet the weed is dried out
Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out
I don't wanna buy no weed from no cop
Get locked up and they close up my shop
That's why I buy no weed from no one
That's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb
The scientifical, mystical one
Growin my crops with the rays of the sun
Come one come all and see how it's done
If you see the pigs there's no need to run
Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb
But you never know what be the outcome
You see the photo in the album
The weed is growin like my erection
Look I never told you where I was from
Some call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb

And the wheels look flat, trunk so heavy in the back
Got the speakers in the front, they be sitting on my lap
Got a bumper to the back, with the trunk weighing it down
Look they think it's a lowrider when they come from my town
That's a King Kong, in the trunk, that's the gorillas behind me

You can hear me from the next block
When I'm on the next block, when I'm headed to the next block

6074,6075,LL Cool J,I Need Love,I Need Love,LL Cool J,"When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
and in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
For the first time in my life I see I need love
There I was, giggling about the games
That I had played with many hearts and I'm not saying no-names
Then the thought occurred, tear drops made my eyes burn
As I said to myself ""Look what you've done to her""
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
All I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal
Playing make believe pretending that I'm true
Holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Sayin' amour kissing you on the ear
Whispering I love you and I'll always be here
Although I often reminisce I can't believe that I found
A desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
One half of me deserve to be this way 'til I'm old
But the other half needs affection and joy
And the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy

I need love

Romance, sheer delight how sweet
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
Kiss you on the cheek and say ""Ooh girl, you're so sweet""
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could go on forever tellin' you what I do
But where you at, you're neither here nor there
I swear I can't find you anywhere
Damn sure you ain't in my closet or under my rug
This love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen
Take a chance with my love you'll find out what I mean
Fantasies can run, but they can't hide
When I find you I'm a pour all my love inside

I need love

I wanna kiss you, hold you, never scold you, just love you
Suck on your neck, caress you and rub you
Grind moan and never be alone
if you're not standing next to me You're on the phone
Can't you hear it in my voice? I need love bad
I got money, but love is something I never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man who's ten feet tall
I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes
We're so in love when we hug, we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ectasy unreal
You're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
It's like a dream-land I can't lie, I've never been there
Maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something I'll never forget

I need love

See what I mean I've changed I'm no longer
A playboy on the run I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust, honor, respect, admiration
This whole experience has been such a revelation
It taught me love and how to be a real man
To always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you, you're my lady and you mean so much
my body tingles all over from the slightest touch
Of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time
'till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you girl, I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands
I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
I'll search the whole world for that special girl
When I finally found you, watch our love unfurl

I need love

LL Talking:
Girl, listen to me
When I be sitting in my room all alone
Staring at the wall
Fantasies, they go through my mind and I've come to realize
That I need true love and if you wanna give it to me girl
Make yourself seen I'll be waiting

I build an empire on the low the narc's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that coco leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the door
O after O, you know, homey I'm just triple beam, dreamin
Niggaz be schemin, I'm fiendin to live a good life

Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see

I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me
Man my cold days, they called me chef boy are 50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed shit
Send me them seeds I'll grow 'em what they need
Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib thats chronic
And I'm sellin them 500 a pop god damn it
I sold everythin I'ma hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes put in water and tell you its wine
If you analyze me, what you'll find is the DNA of a crook

What goes in my mind, it's contagious
Hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If the rap was the block or spider, I'll be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin money man

It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
In the jewels with your chains
I upgrade from 30 BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped procedes from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Played it perf and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin
I make plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender and make a protein shake

Found me outside, clowned me outside
'Til I popped the trunk and they found me outside
Bustin' at the bitches screamin ""off to they rides!""

And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth

Okay rolie polies everywhere [*horse naying noise*]
Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere
Obesity's glarin and she got me fearin
She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literal [*crunching noise*]
-ly, like a box of Cheerios
Carrot cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls
I'm outta order cause I gotta big girl disorder
So better cover up that blubber or I'll split [*feet running away noise*]
And I ain't got time to play
Let's investigate another place to date
Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape
Dresses pettite, no window drapes

Got ya Oprah in jeans
Seems to me a little lean cuisine
Wouldn't hurt much, I don't touch

I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me

Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
Cuz you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncles crazy, ain't he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream

[Chorus]
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise momma's gon' be alright

It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T. V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment

[Chorus]

And if you ask me too
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you
I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'mma break that birdies neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat don't fuck with dad (haha)",eminem

But baby you know the game and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game so bat me down in the paint
'Cause I can't wait no more
'Cause it's about a quarter-past three and shorty's eyein me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I love to see that ass in Gucci shades
Hold down on the bed while I'm yankin your braids

While I'm smackin your ass and fuckin you all wild

And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirk with Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparantly fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share [with Ashanti] somethin so rare, but who cares, you care

Oh I'm, feelin like ya livin a, double life
'Cause you don't be comin home, sometimes
Baby, but you're always, on time, checkin for one time
You and I, got a special bond together
We go back like bombers boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play you play the same way you freak me baby I fuck you crazy
Then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness

Where's my snare
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo yo

Have you ever been hated, or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid thats behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin', and takin' names in the evenin'
Leaving with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigga me, but they'll neva figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probley sick of me now
Ain't you mama, I 'ma make you look so ridiculous now

Chorus:
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
Ha!

I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a coupla months
My faggot father must?ve had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed my goodbye
No I don't, on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side,
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work
Wit her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cause I'd of killed 'em shit I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show

[Chorus]

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through hear purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
' Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, MA?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, MA?
But guess what, ya gettin' olda now and it?s cold when yaw lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that yaw phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your FUNERAL
See whets hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yaself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take when you didn't help me to get,
you selfish bitch
I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!!

I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggaz recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close..
.. to the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely

There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side..
There is a light, that shines,
special for you, and me..

Yo, yo, check it
It's important, we communicate
and tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray everyday more than anything
friends will stay as we begin to lay
this foundation for a family - love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side, oh darling
There is a light, that shines,
special for you, and me..

Yeah.. yo, yo, check it
It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
and I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh
Suggestin beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right, I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace

There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side..
There is a light, that shines,
special for you, and me..

(I'll) take my chances.. before they pass..
.. pass me by, oh darling..
You need to look at the other side..

got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..

Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
but anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Stan

[Chorus: Dido]

[Eminem as 'Stan']
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
four hours and you just said, ""No.""
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you
you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither;
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.
We should be together too

Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me
See Slim; [*screaming*] Shut up bitch! I'm tryin to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?

.. [*brief silence*] .. [*LOUD splash*]

[Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin dogg,
c'mon - how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this (MC on this)... Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter
To not come and speak to me (speak to me)..
I don't know you and no,
I dont owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
I'm not Mr. N*Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin'
I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me

[Chorus]
And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content -
That song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)..
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty
Havin this happenin (this happenin)..
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way (rap this way)..
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin and I have returned

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
To cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)..
To deal with these cocky caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk
With an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin
The same fuckin questions (fuckin questions)..
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out
Cause they drivin me crazy (drivin me crazy).. I can't take it
I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for ev-ery fan that I get
But I can't take a SHIT, in the bathroom
Without someone standin by it
No I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole but I'm glad

Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door

Look at him, walkin around grabbin his you-know-what
Flippin the you-know-who,” „Yeah, but he's so cute though!”
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse, than what's goin on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips”
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel don't they?
„We ain't nothing but mammals..” Well, some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like cantaloupes {*SLURP*}
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope

Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?

things you joke about with your friends inside your living room

in front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
and whether you like to admit it {*ERR*} I just shit it
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can

Pinchin nurses asses when I'm jackin off with Jergens

Screaming ""I don't give a fuck!”
with his windows down and his system up

I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings
At least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jam
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion

I might win much more but lose all that is mine
I could be a lot but I know I'm not
I'm content just with the riches that you bring
I might shoot to win and commit the sin
Of wanting more than I've already got
I could runaway but I'd rather stay
In the warmth of your smile lighting up my day
(the one that makes me say, heh)

'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened - so don't go away

I might be a king and steal my peoples things
But I don't go for that power crazy way
All that I could rule but I don't check for fools
All that I need is to be left to live my way
(say listen what I say)

I could chase around for nothing to be found
But why look for something that is never there
I may get it wrong sometimes but I'll come back in style

6685,6686,Lost Boyz,"Renee (From ""Don't Be A Menace..."")",Renee,Lost Boyz,"Verse One:

Here's a tune about this honey named Renee
That I met one day
On my way back from John Jay
I'm peepin' shorty as she's walking to the train
I tap her on her shoulders
Excuse me Miss, but can I get your name
She said my name is Renee
I said I got a whole lot to say
So may I walk you to your subway
She said if you want
So yo, we started talking
I brought two franks and two drinks
And we began walking
I had to see where that head was at
Because the gear was mad phat
So we must chat about this and that
She told me what she was in school for
She wants to be a lawyer
In other words shorty studies law
I'm telling shorty I'm a writer
And as she's looking for the token
She drops a pack of the EZ-widers
Covers her mouth with her name ring
I said, yo don't sweat the technique shorty rocks
I do the same thing
But yet I use Philly Blunts
She said I never dealt with Philly Blunts
Because I heard that's for silly stunts
I said, nah they burn slower
Right now I really don't know ya
But maybe later on I can get to show ya

Chorus:

A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminice over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty, shorty(x2)

Verse Two:

So now we sittin' on the train
Besides the fingernails
Now shorty got the hairdo of pain
Now I understand she got flava
A tough leather jacket,with some jeans and a chain that her moms gave her
Got off the train about 6:34
She wasn't sure she had grub for the dog so we hit the store
Went to the crib
And turned the lights on
A mad magazine stand
From Essence to Right On
A leather couch
Stero system with crazy cd's
Understand cause she got G'z
She said cheeks do what you want
She said I'm gonna feed the dog
I said alright well I'm gonna roll this blunt
She came back with stretch pants and a ponytail, a t-shirt
A yo, Fam I got a tender-roni girl
We're sitting on the couch chattin
We're smoking blunts off the balcony
We're stearing at Manhattan now
She started feeling on my chest
I started feeling on the breasts
And there's no need for me to stress the rest
A yo, I got myself a winner
We sparked a blunt before we ate
And a blunt after we ate dinner
She had a tattoo she only wanted Bo to see
But first dim the lights and turn up the Jodeci
I'm like whatever shorty rock
We can swing it like that
Cause on the real this is where it's at.

Chorus (2X)

Verse Three:

I woke up the next day on the waterbed
A letter's on the pillow eh
And this what the letter said
It said cheeks, I'll be home around two
You was deep in your sleep
So I didn't want to bother you
I left my number for shorty to call me later
Got dressed
Smoked a blunt
And then I bounced towards the elevator
I got a beep around three
I'm asking shorty what's up with you
She's asking what's up with me
And now we been together for weeks
Candlelight dinner with my shorty
Crack a 40 with my naughty freaks
Hey man, I never been in love
But everytime I'm burstin' in and outta state
It's shorty that I'm thinking of
I'm hanging out with my crew
I get a beep from Renee
Because Renee uses code too
But yet I'm chattin' with her mom dukes
She said Renee has been shot
So cheeks, meet me up at St. Lukes
I jumps on the Van Wyck
I gotta make it there quick
A yo , this shit is gettin' mad thick
Not even thinking about the po nine
I'm doing a buck, who gives a fuck
I'm smokin' boom and the whole nine
I gotta see what's going on
But by the time I reach the hospital
They tell me Mr. Cheeks
Renee is gone
I'm pouring beer out for my shorty who ain't here
I'm from the ghetto
So listen
This is how I shed my tears

Now this one dedicated to the man them call MacGuyver
And all 007 James Bond spy man inside the area
Maximum amount of respect to the man them call Ice Cube
And he bust no deuce deuce, no trey eight, but four four WICKED

Verse 1:

One, two, three and I come with the wicked
style and you know that I'm from the wicked
crew, act like you knew
cos I got everybody jumpin to the voodoo
Pick it, wicked rhymes, picket signs
While me and the mob gotta trunk load of 9's
Play ya and I'll slay ya
I got thug-made dough by the hey-a
Ready to BUCK BUCK BUCK and it's a must
to DUCK DUCK DUCK before I bust
Lookin for the one that did it
but like En Vogue, no you're never gonna get it
Cos I'm the one with the fat mad skills
and I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills
Sittin at the pad just chillin
cos Larry Parker just got me two million, oh what a feelin
So shake that nigga and pass me the pill
and I'll slam dunk it like Shaquille O'Neal
Like it, dig it, maybe and like that test tube baby-
Kick it cos I get wicked

Chorus:
You know them wicked, Ice Cube and Torture Chamber sound
Yes them wicked, him pick up the mic and bust up the ground
Yes them wicked, all of them gyal with the sound
My name is Don Jaguar and Ice Cube we run the town

Verse 2:

Punk say nuttin, just listen
Got me a plan to break Tyson outta prison
Come my way and get served
Still got a duece that'll bunny hop the curb
Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin
Never seen with a happy grin
Show the fat frown cos I'm down
Take a look around
and all you see is big black boots, steppin
Use my steel toe as a weapon
Kick ya and flip ya, now they want to
label this nigga's tape with the sticker
Diggin' out girls that's nicety
Plus I gotta body count like Ice-T
From here to New York
I get skins and ain't talkin bout pork
Swine, pig, dig
Listen to the flow of a so-called negro
who didn't know I was funky as Wilson Pickett
Dig it cos I get wicked

Chorus

Verse 3:

People wanna know how come
I gotta gat and I'm lookin out the window like Malcolm
Ready to bring that noise
Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys
April 29th brought power to the people
and we might just see a sequel
cos police got equal pay
A chazzer's a pig that don't fly straight
Doin' Darryl Gates, but is Willie Williams
down with the pilgrims
Just a super slave
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave
I'm wicked enough to pull this
Cos now it's on to the fullest
Gorilla straight from the mist
But I don't miss when it comes to this
Bring the yellow tape
The white cape, cos I'm so straight
Thru with the picket signs, take his job and stick it
Bigot, cos I get wicked",ice cube
7430,7431,Ice Cube,It Was A Good Day,It Was a Good Day,Ice Cube,"Just waking up in the morning gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl wanna dig out
Hooked it up on later as I hit the do'
Thinking will i live, another twenty-fo'
I gotta go cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all
Which court, are y'all playin basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking niggers everyway like M.J.
I can't believe, today was a good day

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin, didn't even look in a niggaz direction
as I ran the intersection
Went to $hort Dog's house, they was watchin Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Roll em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break em
With the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.
Today was a good day

Left my niggaz house paid
Picked up a girl been tryin to fuck since the twelve grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep so deep so deep
put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
she didn't hesitate, to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting
Took another sip of the potion hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off, then I chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
Two in the morning got the fat burger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read Ice Cube's a pimp
Drunk as hell but no throwing up
Half way home and my pager still blowing up
Today I didn't even have to use my A.K.
I got to say it was a good day.

Hey wait, wait a minute fool
Stop the shit
What the fuck am I thinking about?",ice cube

[LL Cool J]
I just want you to fantasize with imagination
Know what I'm saying, uh yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah I like that
Give me some more, some more of my vocals
You know sex 'em up a little bit
You know what I mean?

You're the honey that I see when I'm riding by
The one giving me a feeling that I can't deny
You got the Prada boots on suede hitting your thigh
Acting like my chrome twenties ain't catching your eye
Sometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror
Turn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer
You're turning me on, keep me standing up
I wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough
I come up to your job and handcuff your boss
Throw that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off
Then sit you up on the copy machine
Make copies of your kitten with my chin in between
Then I'll take you to the window so the world can see
Baby I'm down on my knees let your world be free
Pearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me
Multiple orgasms is your destiny
Wet dream, ride like you're going to Queens
Like I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18
To hell with your boss
Let that nigga hear you scream
Sounding like that screech on the fax machine
Then we can take it to the ladies bathroom
Make your mascara run till you look like a racoon
Touch yourself baby tell me it's wet
Squeeze tight so I'll never forget, here we go

[LeShaun](LL Cool J)
I'ma get you for your paper
Make you leave you girl
(Imagine that)
Make you trick on me around the world
(Imagine that)
Have you calling me your ultimate thrill
(Imagine that)
I got you whipped tell your niggas to chill

[LL Cool J](LeShaun)
I'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide
(Imagine that)
Me and my fold got my broads collide
(Imagine that)
Knocking girls off two at a time
(Imagine that)
Disrespect you and still make you mine
(Uh-uh)

Uh, imagine I'm your teacher and you stayed after school
You've been a bad girl you broke all the rules
Forgot your homework, chewed gum in class
And the only way to fix it is to give me some ass
I got a three piece suit on sitting at my desk
I kinda need a shave but my body smell fresh
You're wearing a plad skirt and long white socks
The vibe is thick baby, we both red hot
I kiss your neck unbutton your blouse
Let my fingers make circles on the edge of your mouth
Your apple's so ripe I'm your tutor for life
Got your beggin' me to put you on detention tonight
You could read the Iliad and the whole Odyssey
But no Trojan soldier scold you like me
Match the calculus then measure my frequency
But when you blast on my lap that's the highest degree
Put your hands on the chalkboard scratch it with ya nails
Give me goose pimples when ya put yo tounge on my dimples
Baby feel me now you got yo ass suspended
Got a letter for your parents but I didn't wanna send it
I stopped by the crib you invited me in
You convinced me somehow to sip some juice and gin
Then you take me to your parent's room and laid me on my back
You twisting, kissing ya fist like that
Rubber meets the road till the tire goes flat
I filled it up with air again baby hold that
You a bad girl look you got your sheets all wet
Squeeze tight so i never forget the teacher's pet

You was laughing with your girlfriends, sippin' a drink
When I came up from behind you and wrapped you with my mink
Guided you to the dance floor and held you tight
We in the Tunnel in the back with the dim red lights
I'm rocking the tank top baby nothing but ice
You rocking the baby tee and mini skirts and spikes
The club is so black we can't see our own hands
I know you feel that bulge through them Fubu pants
You bold huh, wanna feel it in your hands
Rub your ass all up on it cause you know that I want it
God gave you beauty and you love to flaunt it
Life is a song, you were born to perform it
Drink the Cristal at the same time
Get intoxicated till we lose are minds
The crowd seperated as we start to shine
I lift you in the air your skirt starts to climb
We tongue kiss deep in front of the whole crowd
The lights start to flash the music is too loud
We hit the back door and jump in the limousine
You pull up your skirt I put some ice in between
You're tired from the dancing so I kiss your feet
Even though we outside I hear the bass from the beat
Funkmaster Flex chop it up for the freaks
DJ Enuff make the mommies wanna creep
No problem uh mi spouse no aqui
Tu muy caliente tu vamos con mi
Si mami I'm the chaffer make it whip
Take a ride bet you never forget
Here we go

When I twist her in the gold sedan
Like I'm goldie man, you're bitch chose man

Recognize a pimp, open your eyes
Hop in the passenger side of the ride
Damn bleek, can't speak
Uh-huh, okay, what's up, shut up
And close the door
Act like you been in the drop top
On the open road before
Fix your weave, then fix me
Ever gave head doing 160?
Ever seen a pair of kicks this crispy
How you love how the white wife beater fit me
M-dot, him hot, them not

Gone while I'm leanin' smoking

Your bitch on the passenger side of me flashing your money
Why you acting so funny?
You know she been flirting while your working
Behind the curtain knuckles jerking for certain
Poppin' that pussy
Sweatin' till no fluid is left
When I come in the party with j we gonna do it to death
You gon' ruin your rep
Trippin' while we pimpin' these hefers
Playa lectures got me shining like a new gator stepper
Must have been mad
When your ho put my stuff in the dash
Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab
The game don't stop
Legit ballers bending up the block
Niggas rushing, coming at us cause of status and props
Sucking and f**king, loving it when I put tha dick up inside her
Can't help it if she yellin' with a ridah

I thought this was America people!
Uhh, yeah, guilty until proven innocent huh?
That's how we workin huh? Okay
Before me there was many; after me there will be none
I am the one
Uh-huh, okay, I see how we playin

Yeah, I get it down - anxiously the public can't wait
Niggaz had to have it way before it's release date
Jigga get irate, press get it fucked up
Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight
Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape
Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate
I get it down, get it krunk when I get in the state of mind
that what's mine is mine, nobody get to take
I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down
My mental rolodex see these words? I just don't know
I know stress, drama, niggaz upsettin my mama
Arrested, put in the lineup, tryin to put dents in my armor
But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most
Out on bail, fifty thou', still ridin with toast
I ain't tryin to collide with folk,
but I don't want folk takin Jigga for joke
I guess you niggaz just woke - good morning!

[Chorus - R. Kelly]
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me

Try to charge me but I'm not guilty

Tell me.. what y'all want from me?
I'm not guilty

I see how you comin at me now, I'm cool

I'm not the snitch I don't go to the cops to get rich
.. I go to the block and pitch
I go with the glock and click, I go with the pop I'm sick
I go with you hard; I ain't gon' stop for shit
Look in my eyes dog, right in my pupils
If I'm your rival, why would I have to do you?
Press try to throw dirt on my name, disturbin my game
Seemed happy when they heard he was arraigned, glad he's indichted
Got big money, big lawyers to fight it
Just like Cochran, cocksuckers you never see me boxed in
Y'all all knnow it, Jigga's a fighter
Plus I'm clausterphobic, back on the streets before you know it
And my word niggaz, I heard you niggaz
I'm address each and every one of you cocksuckers
Fuck the white press, the block love us, hip-hop forever

Uhh, okay, you on my radar, I got you too bitch

Got lame bitches tryin to fuck with my case
Same lame bitch I bust in her face
Honey just mad I got her fuckin replaced
Plus a birthday pass without me even touchin my safe
But I ain't gon' lie, the head was sick
But what we need to do, is put that mouth on a betta bitch
You heart the rhetorhic, Jigga hit me over the head
with a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?
Naw, how do y'all equate your pain
Would it all go away if I bought you a Range?
I got one or two of those, nothin gon' change
For nothin else, you gotta live with yourself
Try and lie on Hov' cause I ride on the road
in what, most would describe as a Rolls
NO, that's that Continental T
The only car that fit intercontinental me, not guilty

Everybody's like, ""He's no item! Please don't like him.
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!""
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin along
with a flashy nigga braggin on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in ""The Matrix""
But fukkit, let the +Fish-burne+

It's ninety-one son, so somethin's gotta change

Gettin paid to peddle sneakers and soda pop (pop pop pop)
Pop goes the weasel as drawers drop (drop drop dop)
Why not take your top ten pop hit
fix the music and make senseless ryhmes fit

[MC Serch]
I guess it's the fact that you can't be artistic
Intricate raps, becomin so simplistic
I gotta strong mind it doesn't have to be spoon-fed

the second a record was number one on the pop charts

lookin like the same old Klan
Same old theives that skeez so we gotta make sure
that real rap has got to endure

Appearin in complex structure like a pyramid
The paper for the media presence
Ya learn lesson from the face of false legend
Stop vexin on the skills, ya ain't originate
The thin ice you skate upon will break and set ya straight
Ate up on the plate, now who's diesel
Not the weasel, not the weasel, pop goes the weasel

[Pete] But now you're getting sued kinda stoopid

Boosted tracks get slaps, ya got no haps
to reach all four corners of the map

Doin crazy damage so the wack gets banished
Can't manage the truth until you buy a way
Ya ain't quick so ya switch off the exit from my highway
to rest but a crook, had to take a second look
Ever heard of a chef who can't cook?
But the Minister Prime can lay laws
Hey yo, Pete Nice, rip the mic and go for yours

Goes for mine, I goes for mine
Find the Prime won't eat the green eggs and swine
On line like the Serch, in the hoody with the woody
Get a disc or tape, at Sam Goody
Why'd ya run through the doors some left open?
Ropin off the scenes of the crime smokin

Blowin up, like I'm throwin up a beef patty
Sell-outs run a bout like the measles
No cures, cause pop goes the weasels

Twin Benz's, you ride hard, I ride drop
And to make it better, baby got the nina' Beretta tucked low
And I'm two cars back with the four-four
And it freaks you out, on your momma's couch, that's what us thugs be 'bout
You know me
And when I pray for love, baby pray for us, who celebrates the thugs?
My lady
Got me seekin capital game when I spit sixteen
Whether bars or sixteens in the doors of cars
A star is born
In the hood, made a name live on, R-U-L-E, ladies, feel me

(Chorus)

(Charli Baltimore)
Now I'm show you blood or love, there's no belly you bounce from
Blow sellin, dough amounts to no tellin
There'll be no tellin, snitches get it back
Those gats to your backs for my boy
What part of the game is that, huh?
Niggas and they feelings 'cause I handle your dealings, keep your name in tact
My fame's in tact so cops won't know what it's hittin for
Now hoes wanna know what you shittin for
'Cause I'm your bitch, the Bonnie to your Clyde
It's mental, mash your enemies, we out in the rental
I'm your bitch, niggas run up on ya, shift ya lungs, who's your organ donor?
What they know about, extreme meausures I'm a ride with you
And my baby three-eighty at my side
And we lock the town, I'm as down as any thug
My love, they gotta take us in blood, what

(Chorus)

(Ja Rule)
You could die from love, at any given time I could die from slugs
But that's what this life is capable of
The death and the life of a bitch and a thug, is what I'm scared of
But I got a woman that ain't afraid to, tuck the toast in the Escalade
Pop on niggas that showin me shade, but only for the Rule 'cause that's my baby
Got me a down ass bitch with red hair, that don't care
Blazed by the shots and flares
Girl c'mon, follow me, and bust back at police, conceal ya heat
It's a bit much to blaze up, Rule and Chuck, N-I-G, the Murderous, I-N-C
With one on the hip, one in the holster, nigga will toast ya quick
Especially a down ass bitch

(Chorus)

(Ja Rule)
Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, ladies
Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, baby
Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, ladies
Thug on, 'cause you my down ass bitch
Thug on, baby

Yeahhh, well we're back with another one
Comin hard and got suckers on the run
You say, &amp;amp;quot;You guys are known for havin fun&amp;amp;quot;
Yeah well we'll do what has to be done for us to be number one
And you ain't never heard nuthin this funky son
You ain't never heard nuthin this funky ever, it's too clever
Rhyme goes through your mind like a guillotine severs
the head, my friend
And you will never hear nobody rap like this again

[Big Money Odis]
You ain't heard nuttin this funky brother, it's like no other
You feel the bass bouncin off the walls like rub-bah
The real McCoy this ain't no toy or another
How do we do it? (Shock G: Yo go ask your mother)
The freak needers, the beat leaders
Let me tell you somethin, you ain't heard nuttin this funky Peter
So listen up as we begin
Aiyyo Fuze rub the record in

[both] cause you ain't heard nuttin this funky (4X)

[Big Money Odis]
The definition of a rhyme breeder, beat needer
We're the cold party heaters, comin through the woofers and the tweeters
Funky dope MC leaders
Rhyme hungry hip-hop listener feeders

[Shock G]
The definition of a rhyme sayer, beat layer
Mothersucker perpetrator slayer
Layin down the law like the Mayor
You're out of luck, Hucklebuck, I'll suck you up like a Now or Later
You say that you're a trooper, then I'm Darth Vader
You're a Cowboy, then I'm a Raider

[Big Money Odis]
You can't compete cause you're incomplete and need to be completed
You're style is weak you're obsolete and need to be deleted
Short on the things that you needed
So what you got a top ten song, cause you cheated

[Shock G]
If you worked in a kitched, it'd be sweeter
From the rappin that I hear, you'd make a better egg beater
A teeter totter, or should I say, totter teeter
You're through, you're a court and we're leaders
We got the style you admire, the rhymes you desire
Well you ain't heard nuttin this slick you trick
cause you're a flick from a Bic and we're a bonfire

[both] cause you ain't heard nuttin this funky (4X)

*some scratching by DJ Fuze*

[Big Money Odis]
Cause I roll up fast, like a cheetah, get out the two-seater
Walk up on a girl named Anita, or Rita
Ask her for change to put money in the meter
Didn't really need it just a smooth way to meet her
or a fly way to treat her
She said, &amp;amp;quot;I'm hungry&amp;amp;quot; so I took her out to feed her
She was a pocket feeder chicken, fajita pita eater
I said, &amp;amp;quot;Yo, eat how ya like&amp;amp;quot; then took her home and G'd her

[Shock G]
The definition of a funky rhyme master
Clevely put together but not necessarily sayin it faster
Ya see, that style isn't hard at all
The object of the game is to have a ball y'all
And to see who can come the funkiest
Lot of MC's think it's just a speed contest
They wanna brag about the neighborhood, oh you wanna boast?
We come from different cities and we're coast to coast ya see
but right now we're based in Oakland (Odis: Oakland)
Everywhere we go we leave the microphone smokin
Yo bro I'm not jokin
Leave MC's standin still with their mouths hangin open
Walk offstage and leave the next act scratchin his head like a monkey

You constantly frontin' until you confronted on
If you don't like what's goin' on gwoin to another song
Cause I keep a haa guilty
My cars and my money all alike man, both them filthy (get it?)
From skimpy and empty to fuel on full
See I be high when my car go Bulls

And we all push it, but me I push it real good
Brains blown out, chromed out, wheel real wood

Now they ask how I talk what you know about that
Dominated '06, now I'm going right back
See me reign hell, lettem show me like that
Even Denzel say ""damn, I ain't know it like that""
Nigga yea, still bankhead you can tell
Ain’t nothing changed but the name on the mail
I still kick in doors with them thangs in the air
Up in Benihana, see me slang in da chair

I suggest you adjust the bass, except for when it going down
A-town, west side, Club Crucial, catch me,
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro &amp; Mac be
Jackers lying say they caught me slipping how could that be
I’m something like a stalker I be everywhere the strap be
The trap be, jumping with that 100 dollar slab
If I wanted nigga I could get 100 on the tab
Sell em all double down Nigga do the math
Think I won’t pull up in something with 200 on the dash?

Got a pocket full of change and they C-note stacks
Bustin dominoes, spades, cee-lo, craps
We shootin pool at the Luda-plex; I slap a hundred on the table
just to see if any fools wanna do it next
I got games galore, I got game for sure
And when I win I spit game to whores (yep)
Or double it back, I'll double the stacks
Throw a dub, a big face or double the stack (boy)
And we can 'bout anything that you wanna do
But come up short and OH THE THANGS that the gun'll do
Throw in the towel cause I'm makin 'em sweat
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet
So hurry up and come get some, if you want some
You know the phrase - scared money don't make none!

Countin green in the DROP, because whether legal or illegal
all my people bring the strength to the block
Yessir, I thought you knew it, we loco
We'll bet on anything, just to see if anybody's gon' do it

8046,8047,Biz Markie,Just A Friend,Just a Friend,Biz Markie,"Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, 'Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof'
I asked her her name, she said 'blah-blah-blah'
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, 'How do you like the show?'
she said, 'I was very amused'
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, 'Do ya have a man?' she tried to pretend
She said, 'No I don't, I only have a friend'
Come on, I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing

You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jacq
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', getttin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Everytime that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, and then I called again
I said, 'Yo, who was that?' 'Oh, he's just a friend'
Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust this

You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
'Yo, could you tell me where is door three?'
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in the mouth,
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend",biz markie

8194,8195,Young Jeezy Featuring Nas,My President,Let's Impeach the President,Neil Young,"Let's impeach the President for lying
And misleading our country into war
Abusing all the power that we gave him
And shipping all our money out the door

Who's the man who hired all the criminals
The White House shadows who hide behind closed doors
They bend the facts to fit with their new stories
Of why we have to send our men to war

Let's impeach the President for spying
On citizens inside their own homes
Breaking every law in the country
By tapping our computers and telephones

What if Al Qaeda blew up the levees
Would New Orleans have been safer that way
Sheltered by our government's protection
Or was someone just not home that day?

Where - ""All that I can tell you is that Osama Bin Laden is a prime suspect.""
Lie - ""I don't know where he is... I don't spend that much time on him.""
Where - ""I want him held...I want justice...dead or alive""
Lie
Where - ""Saddam Hussein aids and protects terrorists...""
Lie - ""...Including members of Al Qaeda.""
Where - ""I know I didn't say there was direct connection between September 11th...""
Lie - ""...and Saddam Hussein.""
Where - ""War is my last choice.""
Lie - ""We're gonna smoke 'em out...bring 'em on.""
Where - ""When you think Patriot Act.. constitutional (q)Guarantees are in place.""
Lie - ""A wiretap requires a court order""
Where - ""Saddam Hussein has got weapons of mass destruction""
Lie - ""Although we have not found stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction.""
Where - ""And it is true that most of the intelligence turned out to be wrong.""
Lie - ""No one can now doubt the word of America.""

Let's impeach the President for hijacking
Our religion and using it to get elected
Dividing our country into colors
And still leaving black people neglected

Thank God he's cracking down on steroids
Since he sold his old baseball team
There's lots of people looking at big trouble
But of course our President is clean.

Maybe it will sound like something they've never heard

And drank till I was full, I drank till I was full
I was thirsty but I drank till I was full,
I drank till I, till I,till I was full

I keep my head low low low to avoid the swell

Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again, coming home again


I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I love most, she had so much soul
She said ""Excuse me little homie, I know you don't know me
But, my name is Wendy [windy], and
I like to blow trees"" and
From that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tell 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she show me how to go downtown
And in the nighttime, her face lit up, so astound
And I told her, in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers cause they always leave
She said it felt like they walked and drove on me
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV, and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said ""keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me""

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm coming home again, coming home again

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Ohh
Oh, now I'm coming home again
Maybe we could start again.

But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport, to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you, and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do, just not new""
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'till it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that, when I was back home
Every interview I'm representing you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall you land on a cloud
Jumpin' a crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around

Yo, a day in the life of a player named Quik
I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow with a head like a brick
And just because I drink the 8, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc-est
Now this is how we do it when we checkin a grip
Teddy Bear's in the house, so don't even trip
We're bustin funky compositions as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick it to this funky ass rhythm
It's Friday morning, the phone is ringin off the hook *brrrrrring*
And AMG is puttin down girl rhymes in his notebook
Or should I say dope sack, because we don't bust wack *brrrrrring*
I pick up the phone and it's the D (whassup nigga?)
He said he's comin down at about two on the dot
So I'm about to rush the tub while my water's still hot
And now I'm soakin, a brother like the devestatin DJ Quik ain't jokin
Fuck with me on DSP and you'll get broken
My name is Quik, but you can call me Daddy
Yo open up the door, they think I'm Freak Man in a Caddy
Now Freaky's in an El doggin shabbies in at Alco
And everybody's sippin on a quart (here we go)
D just came with a forty and a quart
In addition to the three that Greedy just brought
But I don't wanna start early, so I just might
put my forty in the freezer cause I wanna get bent *tonite*

Tonight is the nite *tonite*
Tonight's the nite (yo when we gon get bent) *tonite*

And now I'm out of the tub up in a fancy freak
Spray on some serious and put on my Girbaud jeans
Sweatsuit, the gray one with the burgundy trim
And it's a medium, fit me proper cause I'm nice and slim
Five thirty on the clock and the sun is steadily sinkin
And I am steadily thinkin about the 8 that I'll be drinkin
You know I ain't ashamed and you know I ain't bashful
So go on and pop the forty so I can pour me a glassful
Ham is in the bedroom rollin up a stencil
Fatter than a pinky and the length of a pencil
Freakie lit it up and hit it one two three
Shabby took a hit and then they pass it to me
It's the bomb!!!
Yo I can feel my senses Get numb!!!
Yo fuck the forty ounce I need some rum!!!
I'm chillin like a villain Here I come!!!
And that's how I'm livin
Tonight is the nite and I'm lookin real sporty
Proper Friday evening and I'm ready to party
Crusher came in with a handful of snaps
Fuck it, let's shoot some craps

Wake up Saturday morning and I got a headache
I can't believe that I'm sick from all the shit that I drank
*last nite* Soon as I felt it comin on
I should quit, it's true that a drunk ain't shit
To the man up above, the whole thanks I give
I'll never drink again if you just let me live
Mike P spoke to me and I said I couldn't call it
Call it Earl like a mother while I'm grippin the toilet
I need a 7-Up, because my head is spinnin
Round and round I think I better sit down
My homey Shot is alright, but I'm feeling faint
I guess he's used to it, but a nigga like Quik ain't
K is on the phone, and Teddy's at the door

Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did

Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin 'em up
Some powder cake shit that's about to erupt
Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?

Wear a vest for the killers, nuttin less cause it's reala
In the Big Apple, where it's quick to get your shit tackled
Enemies spit at you, best friends kidnap you

Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse then my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Ummmm...)
And Dr. Dre said, ""Slim Shady you a basehead!""
Uh-uhhh! ""Then why's your face red? Man you wasted!""
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!)

My english teacher wanted to have sex in junior high.
The only problem was, my english teacher was a guy.
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Owwwwwwww!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, killin' pedestrians, rapin' lesbians,
While they're screamin': ""Lets just be friends!""
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin drugs, and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush the stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans (Aaahhhhhh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE!'

I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive(Huh yup!)
Am I comin or goin? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM? (WAH!)
YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS! (WAHHH!)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (BANG!)

But the very best (Klaka, bo bo, BDP crew, bo bo bo bo!)
No MC can test *cut and scratch of KRS saying &amp;amp;quot;but one&amp;amp;quot;*

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on!

Verse One:

I'm bout to hit you wit that tradional style of cold rockin
Givin options for head knockin non stoppin
Tip-toppin lyrics we droppin but styles can be forgotten
so we bring back the raw hip-hoppin
Just like the records and tapes you be coppin
Cop some breakdancin, boogie poppin, and lockin
Tic tockin, guaranteed to have you clockin
We only get better and only better we have gotten
This type of flow don't even think about stoppin
Beware, the length of the rhyme flow can be shockin
All music lovers in the place right now
That never understood the way that KRS got down
Yo I'm strictly about skills and dope lyrical coastin
Relying on talent, not marketing and promotion
If a dope lyrical flow is a must
You gots to go with a name you can quickly trust
I'm not sayin I'm number one, uhh I'm sorry, I lied
I'm number one, two, three, four and five
Stop wastin your money on marketing schemes
and pretty packages pushin dreams to the beams
A dope MC is a dope MC
With or witout a record deal, all can see
And that's who KRS be son
I'm not the run of mill, cause for the mill I don't run

until I recite, in black and white what's right
Let me take flight, my style is TIGHT AN GOOD
TIGHT AN GOOD, come is it TIGHT AN GOOD
Old styles I pass dat, slow down on fast rap
All in yo' ass crack, old King go Blast dat
Conjure to ask dat, hyper type of flashback
I publish like ASCAP lyrics for hand clap
No past rappin, youth trackin, talent lackin
MC's more worried about their financial backin
Steady packin a gat as if something's gonna happen
But it doesn't, they wind up shootin they cousin, they buggin
I appear everywhere and nowhere at once
I know my style is bumpin, even though some people front
It's the God of rap, you heard of it
The one that rhymes toward the sky givin airplanes mad turbulence
In rap tournaments, I reign permanent
Don't you think by now the number one spot I'm not concerned with it
The course of rap I'm turnin it
Back to that good old fashioned way of getting cash money by earning it
No bogus hocus pocus, I bring back to focus
Skills if you notice my position is lotus
Now quote this, MC's are just hopeless
Thinkin record sales make them the dopest

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on!
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on!

I was so used to being next to you
Life for me is not the same
There's no one to turn to
I don't know why I let it go too far
Starting over it's so hard
Seems like everywhere I try to go
I keep thinking of you

I just had a wake up call
Wishing that I never let you fall
Baby you are not to blame at all
Remember when I pushed you away
Baby if you knew I cared
You'd have never went nowhere
Girl I should've been right there

How do I breathe, without you here by my side?
How will I see, when your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go, when your heart's where I lay my head?
When you're not with me, how do I breathe?
How do I breathe?

Yes I made a mistake
I thought that you would be mine
Guess the joke was on me

I wish I knew where you could be

Seguro que han oído que yo soy educado
Soy un caballerito un chico bien portado
Un joven responsable y siempre bien vestido
Yo no se quien ha mentido
I don't drink or smoke ain't into dope
Won't try no coke, ask me how I do it, I cope
My only addiction has to do with the female species
I eat 'em raw like sushi
No me gustan ternos, mi estilo es moderno
Si me enterno, you me enfermo
Mi apariencia es dura, vivo en la locura
No me vengan con ternuras
So please don't judge a book by its cover
There's more to being a latin lover
You got to know how to deal with a woman
That won't let go
The price you pay for being a gigolo

[Verso 2]
There's not a woman that can handle
A man like me
That's why I juggle two or three
I ain't one to commit, you can omit that bit
You pop the question that's it
Haber uno, dos, tres, cuatro mujeres
Y la situación ahi no muere
No es un delito calmo mi apetito
Con un llanto o un grito
So again don't let my lyrics mislead you
I don't love you but I need you
Would you rather have me lie
Take a piece of your pie and say bye
Or be honest and rub your thighs

Le digo ¡Hola! Pero no me para bola

Y usted señor? Why's your chin on the floor?
Cierra la boca por favor

but I'm out for the night, so pass that dro

Trick car alarms, then bend them curves
Chop chop, chunk it up fat man herb

Y'all know me, still the same ole G, but I been low key
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all fulla tracks to add to the walls fulla plaques
Hanging up in the office and back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my doe freeze, hoe please, you betta bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees? Who you think brought you the Oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes and D.O.C's,
The Snoop D-O double G's and the group that said mother fuck the police
Gave you a tape full dope beats to bump when you stroll through in ya hood
And when you albums sales wasn't doin' too good who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely, all you niggas that said that I'd turned pop
On the firm flop, y'all are the reason Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all
If y'all don't like me... Blow me
Y'all gone keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me

{Eminem} {Chorus} (2x)
Nowadays everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips,
Jus a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act, like they Forgot About Dre

{Second Verse}
So what do you say to some body you hate? (What)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve thing's in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of NWA
One day I was walkin by, with a walkman on, when I caught a guy
Givin me an awkward eye so I strangled him off at the parkin lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not I'm harder than me tryna park a dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck right next to a humongous truck in a two car garage
Hoppin out with 2 broken legs tryna walk it off, fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin barkin dogs
And when the cops came through me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches and still weren't found out (Right here)
So from here goin out it's the Chronic Two, startin today and tomorrows the new
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death wit a Charleston chew
chikka-chikka-chikka Slim Shady, hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up when the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin men ladies
Sorry doc but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's OK go with him Hailey (Da Da?)

{Chorus}(2x)

{Dr Dre} {Third Verse}
If it was up to me you motherfuckers would stop comin' up to me with ya hands out
Lookin' up to me, like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I gots a lil company everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me cause I'm from the streets of Compton!
I told 'em all, all them lil gangsters who you think help mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talk about guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all?
Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin Dre fell off?
What Cause I been in the lab with a pen n a pad tryna get this damn label off?
I ain't havin that
This is the millennium of Aftermath and ain't gonna be nothin after that
So gimmie one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So wheres all the mad rappers at? It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats when you were cuddlin' a cabbage patch

All I heard were shells
Fallin on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm tryin to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene
You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem
Yo, I'll solve it

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed
This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast
Other DJ's say, ""Damn""
If my rhyme was a drug
I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem
Yo--I'll solve it!
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it.

But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
He'd betreated like a punk, you know that's unheard of

I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the stripes
So I gotta be down with the hoodteam

Got my tin in my hand and a gleame in my eye

And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger, fool

If I'm wrong love tell me, cause I get caught up
and the life I live is Hell see, I never thought I'd see

When I was young me and my mama had beef
17 years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mamas place
Suspended from school, scared to go home
I was a fool with the big boys, breaking all the rules
Shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies
The same drama, when things went wrong we blamed mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary
One day, running from the police that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend mama
You always was a black queen mama
I finally understand for a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man
You always was committed, poor single mother on welfare
Tell me how you did it, there's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

(Chorus)
LaAAAAdy, don't ya know we love ya
Sweet laAAAAdy, place no one above ya
Sweet laAAAdy, don't ya know we love ya

Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy 'cos the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cos my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless
But all along I was looking for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cos even though I sell rocks
It feels good putting money in your mailbox
I love paying rent when the rent's due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cos when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone 'cos you cared for me
And I can see you coming home after work, late
You're in the kitchen tryin' to fix us a hot plate
Just working with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgiving
But now the road got rough, you're alone
Tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

(Chorus)

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cos through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I got to thank the Lord the you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle, everyday gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Verse One:

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, if don't nobody else care
And uhh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin to gas ya up, I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy (what's that)
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up

Verse Two:

Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up
You know it's funny when it rains and pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
They say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
there ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up

To all the ladies havin babies on they own

Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man, feelin helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things don't all down this week
Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's getten older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders

Before 99 I was born again
5 years later and I'm on again
Man I think I'm born to win
Mase broke, that's a oxy moron
Forget a bus, I bought a drop to tour on
G-4's What I soar on, uh
You thinkin I ain't hot you so wrong
Sorry for the prolong
But now life goes on
Long list of hits and it goes on
I wake up, and I don't even feel like a star
And man I'm getting a million a bar
Indeed I need not take no lie
Man, ya'll gone make me cry
It's kinda eerie when you hear me
Ya hairs stand up

Rip your old plan up

And I don't chase money man
Money chase me

I give a little bit, and she fiend for more (lets go)

Put up a good fight

Hate the game, but it made a man a man
Gone for a while, its like I ran away
God tI'me now, and I don't plan to play

Save a horse, ride a cowboy.

Well I don't give a dang about nothing
I'm singing and Bling- Blanging

Or your freak parade

I'm a thourough-bred
that's what she said
in the back of my truck bed
As I was gettin' buzzed on suds
Out on some back country road.
We where flying high
Fine as wine, having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go.
But her evaluation
of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation
all night long
So I took her out giggin frogs
Introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Willie Nelson song I could think of

And we made love
And I saddled up my horse
and I ride into the city
I make a lot of noise
Cause the girls
They are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway
on my old stud Leroy
And the girls say
Save a horse, ride a cowboy.
Everybody says

Hey little suckers i know you hear me callin you
Cause you wanted some but i see that you ougta do
Frontin ain't no future and you're frontin so let's get i on
Like marvin gaye, take the cash and siti it on
The hood of ya wick-wack low-ridin cadillac
Back up ya boys and let's start the battle
Act like, ya know, the masta ace don't play when it come to my bass, aahhhh

Chorus:
Check it out baby, check it out y'all
I was born to roll (repeat several)

Drivin down the block like what else should a brother do
It's saturday, it's saturday, the heat might smother you
Rollin down my windows yeah i have a air-conditioner
But i got the sound i want the whole world to listen ta
Waitin at a red light, kentucky fried chicken in
Low end theory tape in, bass crazy kickin in
See this puerto rican latin chico rico suave
In a red corolla eh yo does he wanna play
Pullin up beside me, lookin like he want it
Show me what ya got then watch me get up on it
Holdin up traffic but we can't hear they horns
Cause he music a grande yeah he got it goin on
Bit i think i better school him cause he don't know the time
So i'm turnin up the boom cause he cannot mess with mine
Brothers hear me hittin from like 50 blocks away i
Wanna turn they heads so you know i gotta play
High decibels passin through a residential district
See a few cuties and i turn it up like this quick
Mira, mira man don't sleep, i got tha, i got tha, i got tha woofers in my jeep

Black boy, black boy turn that shit down
You know that america don't wanna hear the sound
Of the bass drum jungle music go back to africa
Nigga i'll arrest ya if ya holdin up trafffic
I'll be damned if i listen, so cops save your breath and
Write another ticket if ya have any left and
I'm breakin ear drums while i'm breakin the law
I'm disturbin all the peace cause sister souljah said war
So catch me if ya can, if ya can here's a donut
Cause once ya drive away, yo i'm gonna go nut
And turn it up to where it was before nice try
But ya can't stop the power of the bass in ya eye
I wonder if i blasted a little elvis presley
Would they pull me over and attempt to arrest me
I really doubt doubt it, they probably start dancin
Jumpin on my tip and pissin in they pants and
Wigglin and jigglin and grabbin on they pelvis
But you know my name so you never hear no elvis
Strictly the hardcore dirty street level hits
God's on my side so watch what the devil gets
Positivity hittin 50 levels deep
Comin out, they comin out the woofers in my jeep

Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
Hey, baby my nose is gettin' big
I noticed it be growin' when I be telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's getting weaker
Probably cause my lies just started gettin' deeper
And the reason for my confession is that I learned my lesson
And I really think you oughta know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for
I admit that I have been a little immature
Fuckin' wit your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies I was the editor and the author
I forged my signature
And I apologize for what I did to you,
'Cause what you did to me I did to you

Tryin' to maintain but the feeling won't change

Caught up in living my life in the fast lane
Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things
And I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie
And now her emotions are drained
Cause' I lie and I lie and a little lie lie
Now your emotions are drained

Oh, that'll work
Be funky
You know what I'm sayin?

(Cars ride by with the boomin systems)
(Cars ride by)

Funky
For all the cars out there
And all the brothers
That like to front in their rides
Check it out

You know it's funky, funky, funky cos you heard it from hear-say
A jam that you love that don't be gettin no airplay
Strictly for frontin when you're ridin around
12 o'clock at night with your windows down
Headlights breakin cos your batteries drain
Armor all on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin outside of all the hip-hop spots
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots
Leanin to the side, people everywhere
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
Cos they don't understand why I act this way
Pumpin up the funky beat until the break of day
It's because I want attention when i'm ridin by
And the girls be on my jock cos my system's fly

Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
Cos they be hear me gettin funky frequently
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this
Mind your business
Now pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin my head
While I'm checkin out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
I'm frontin, and I don't care if you know
The backseat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise - it's 3 o'clock
The girlies, they smile, they see me comin
I'm steady hummin, I got the Funky Drummer drummin
My trunk be shakin, vibratin and rattlin
Pumpin so loud, all the shorties be battlin
A right-hand man's here without the swing
Every chance I get I'm showin off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
Cos I'm frontin in my ride and my word is bond

Sun roof open, so I can feel the wind blow
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the o to the o to the l to the i to the n
To the f to the r to the o to the n to the t to the i to the n
That means I'm chillin
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back, so I can get real cosy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say: I want bass
I want a hit, I want a dose
You're rollin up smilin, but you can't come close
Cos my system is pumpin loud
Like Rakim said: I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE
Tell the cops: you gots to chill with EPMD
This is something devastatin that'll break your trunk
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk

You know what i'm sayin

So next time you're in your ride pumpin it up

And I come from the darkside, so I'm havin a hard time stayin on track man,
My mind be racin', and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet
Been in and out of relationships, I'm startin to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin back, prayin' that, you get that piece of mind of me
I thought I was right, but really I'm wrong, but again I was too blind to see,
I was in the fast lane chasin my dream,
And then it seemed when the fame and cash came, they just got me,
Goin crazyyyy, (lately, lately) lately I been so faded trying to erase it,
But I just can't cause the drama just grows greater,
And I been in so many collisions by puttin shit off till later.

I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

It's like I'm takin five steps forward, and ten steps back
Tryin' get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin away the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close? And uh,
I just don't know but I be out here fightin demons and
It's like the curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland and
Lord, would you help me? And stop this pain
I keep inflinctin on my family (family)
Hustlin and gamblin, drinkin' and scramblin'
And losin sight of what I supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage cause every days a challenge and man
And I'm slippin can't lose my balance and tryin not to panic

Verse One:

I came to bring the pain hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
Find out my mental's based on instrumental
records hey, so I can write monumental
Methods, I'm not the King
But niggaz is decaf I stick em for the CREAM
check it, just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad fish accept it
In your Cross Colour, clothes you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Kross
Who da boss? Niggaz get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and comin for the head piece protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket, niggaz want the ruckus
Bustin at me bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild

Verse Two:

Brothers want to hang with the Meth bring the rope
the only way you hang is by the neck nigga poke

Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga you can bet your bottom dollar hey I bomb shit
And it's gonna get even worse word to God
It's the Wu comin through sickin niggaz for they garments
Movin on your left, southpaw em it's the Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test realize you're no contest
Son I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four
nine three eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin 90 proof
Huh vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me aiy, give it to me raw
I've learned when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a hoe
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay da mo'

What is it? Niggaz think they bigga
Because they got the finga on the trigga of a pistol
They don't know I'm wicked, when I start to kick it
With the raw sound, wash it down with a Mystic
Then I add a Snapple, nigga want the juice but he don't want the hassle
Then we try to overthrow the castle
Better yet the tent when I'm comin to your town
Black man, the rental, God, the pistol
YAH! If you don't want a burn from GLOCK then beware,
I buck shots, we move up, the buck stops here,

Unless it's being made by hoes

The club was far from empty
It was crowded at the entry (Woo!)
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me (Uh-huh!)
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)

Oh hell, there he go again talkin' that shit
Bend, corner's like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
you got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
Cause when we step up in the party, like I'm out-you-scurry
So go get your fuckin' shine box, and your sack of nickles
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy fat sacks, B-I-G B-O-I

Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone
The alienators cause we different keep your hands to the sky

No drugs or alcohol so I can get the signal clear as day

He's more than a man
and this is more than love
the reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in
because I'm gone again
and to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
to know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna be... a murderer

as I'm doing my hair
preparing for another day
A kiss upon my cheek
as he reluctantly
ask if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
where I'm about to go
and we know it very well

I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be... a murderer

His trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with

so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If you're a stripper named Porscha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because

[Chorus]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more could you ask for?
The international assholes nah
Who complains about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,
When he came, in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kane
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic

You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&amp;amp;amp;R's lookin' like &amp;amp;quot;pssh we messed up&amp;amp;quot;
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog &amp;amp;quot;Yo, where Dame at?&amp;amp;quot;
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
&amp;amp;quot;What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?&amp;amp;quot;
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......

Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)",kanye west

Put the key under the mat
And you know I'll be over there
(Yup) I'll be over there
Shawty, I'll be over there
I'll be hitting all the spots that u ain't even know was there
Ha. And you ain't even have to ask twice
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustom to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chilling with no make up on
That's when your the prettiest
I hope that you don take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one to Never get confused with Cause.

We can do it real big.
Bigger then you ever done it.

Baby I be on that tank shit
Buzz so big i could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop
Bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl
But money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee
Cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make yo pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on
double cup love
You the one i lean on
Feeling for a fix then you should really get yo pheen on
Yea just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there repping like a mascot
Get it from the back
And make yo fucking bra strap pop
All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots

Baby you my everything you all i ever wanted.
We can do it real big.

Forget all the MC's who like to mingle

I bet your fret, sweat, and regret you met

Straight from a page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy,

She in the mirror dancing so sleazy,
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a ‘Oeur de Whopdee’
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggaz got me,

Fronting though, yo I wouldn’t wanna know
If somebody would’ve told me a year ago

Feeling like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory’s museum,
I’m just saying, Hey Mona Lisa,

I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
Cuz lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
Cuz I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrased to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self destruct

Baby smile today
Cuz I been on that journey always
I'm gon' luv u better

Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' luv u better

[Verse 2]
When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL's, bigets and rings
Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'ma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don't say no
Cuz I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow

I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I'll never be the same

Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You can have it your way, how do you want it
You gon' back that thing up or should i push up on it
Temperature risin, okay lets go to the next level
Dance floor jam packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby it's simple
If you be a nympho I'll be a nypmho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental,
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin you 'bout how sprung I gotcha
Wanna show me how you work it baby, no problem
Get on top then get to bouncing round like a low rider
I'm a seasoned fit when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat you can play with the stick
I'm tryin to explain baby the best way I can
I melt in your mouth girl, not in your hands (ha ha)

[Chorus]

And where we do (and where we do)
The things we do (things we do)
Are just between me and you (oh yeah)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Give it to me baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in the rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door she get to pullin on my zipper
It's like it's a race who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic how erotic it is to watch her in thongs
Had me thinking 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she winds
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
As Long as she ain't stoppin, homie I aint stoppin
Drippin wet with sweat man its on and popping
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle its on
And we gon' sip til every bubble in the bottle is gone

All emcee's falled when I heard the albums droppin'
Nuttin but the hottest hip-hop rap concoction
Rap's in a state of emergency, it's shockin'
I produce joints that loosen up the socket
Crowd surf through the mosh pit on some rock shit
Bang your head to this, pump your fist if your feelin' it
Ride the fuck out, bust a clip for the fuck of it
This is as good as it get, who you rollin' with? (You)
Who the ultimate? (Wu)
Stay commited, sold my soul to this rap shit
Slow your roll, strike a bowl, you get glapped quick
I roll with, ghetto bastard with biscuits
And grab my dick and flick it, get the picture

The next step'll bomb on where your car alarm was
Chikens that'll run in, burn the barn up
Shots'll tear Sean John and Phat Farm up

Never lost to emcee's as lame as y'all
Never, trick a bitch car payment off

Leavin' stains of blood on your Rolie Glass
When im in your hood nigga throw me bags

Im flexable, they used to call me plastic
These big butt bitches get they ass kicked
It is what it is, shittin' on y'all kids
Couldn't live where we live
I can't be defeated like nobody used to wizz
Like, when daddy's home can't nobody beat the kids
Right? You know the clan and you know the fuckin' man
Meth rock a mic without a kickstand
Two blunts, and razors in his wristband
Slap you and your bitch man
Lookin' in your lobby, call me stick-man
When it's goin' down, call me quicksand
Zero to sixty in a second, pack a Smith &amp;amp; Weston
And if the price is right, you can be the next contestant

And drop heat on the streets through zero degree storms
And keep the ghetto, pop your metal
Smoke it like a cigarette till ya optic yellow

With diciton, they in thick, when I put fire to the stakes

Instinct leads me to another flow
Everytime I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Trying to make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be getting mad, when we playing, it's cool
But don't you be calling out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talking, one day I was walking down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath
Then the little one said (Yeah me bitch) and laughed
Since he was with his boys he tried to break fly
(Huh) I punched him dead in his eye and said
""Who you calling a bitch?""

Chorus (2x)

I hit the bottle There ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work and they gave you an attitude
then you were rough
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me
All that I knew was you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go, even though you treated me bad
But I don't want my kids to see me getting beat down
By daddy smacking mommy all around
You say I'm nothing without ya, but I'm nothing with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not taking it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gonna come to ya til you do right by me
Brother you ain't that sick? (Who you calling a bitch?)

Chorus

What's going on in your mind is what I ask ya
But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though
You wear a rag around your head and you
Call yourself a ""Gangsta Bitch"" now that you saw Apache's video
I saw you wilding, acting like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe...hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you trying to jump in front of the bullet (Young lady)
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type (yeah)
Ain't none of this worth getting your face sliced
Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right?
(Bucking with nobody)
She got to wear that for life (Who you calling a bitch?)

I sets the party off just like Tanqueray
The Funk Lord, nobody else could swing this way
I put the loc to the motion, drop the funk coast to coast and
I Buck like Shot, cuz I know I Got Cha Opin
Check the soup, I Dogg the mic like Snoop
I get swift like H-Town, when I Knock Da Boots (daaat's right)

I Show like Doug E. and I rock the mic lovely
The afrodesiac, bringin the do-wah-diddy
to your city, on the Zapp side with the vibe

I'm on a mission of just hitting
now it's written and kitten hittin wit mittens
I'm missing wishing man listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishing.
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded I said it word
Damn, you nerd man, you heard
Coming from the town of Illy and alleys are
full of Phillies and Rallys suckers get
Silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really

Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow

Never mixing with tricking brothers bitching
Over fixins that ain't fittin to be hittin.
On nothin splittin things that's bitten
And gettin written off
Like a fatter bad bladder boy ya pissing me off
Before you even started so what
So long see you fly by my try how else
Could I say it when you play it try boom bye bye.

The flow pro poetical with skills only
A vet'll know better know where's
The wetter flow that'son point like
Decimals manhandlin new crews
Partying with the Zoo Crew
Looking for the pink in poo poo.
I thought you knew too stone style is of stamina
Jammin ta while we plannin ta jam
We bust plus we're the party
Amateur damager managin damagin mics
Men and even mannequins.
You're a fan again now I wanna know whose the man again?

The way I show you pray I flow
Steady breakin to the boogie so bang time
To slang bang and watch all the poo tang tangs hang

Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
The beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully chase bass lines like bullies
All we wanna know is if your body wanna party
It's nuff poo tang tang for everybody
So hip up and split up get up
Get up your wit up souped up put your dukes up
No guts set up for sit ups flip up watch us rip up.
Shakes shows until they fizz up
RZA like your with us if not zip up
You lip up whip up.
Hits with ransom's foul styles get and ones
We come back cause we heard
Hip hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah in fact and for ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flowers
Bevin these since the seventies
Find me so we went crazy in the eighties
So we won't kiss heinies in the nineties
Oops the Naughty's troop in sections of forties
So clap your hands and hold your shorty I'm Naughty.

Hello what's happening world?
Yo this Big Gipp I've been called down
By Lil' Jon &amp; The Eastside Boyz
To tell you what's really happening
On these streets in the A-town man
Cause you know a lot of shit going on
A lot of flaw, a lot of people moving up
A lot of people moving down
You know what I mean, but after this
I'm a tell you the truth now

Now after these 12 bars the world is gonna know a few facts
And after these 12 bars you might get your shoulders in your laps
See the neighborhood boys and the economy getting worse
The candy lady jumping fifties outta Easter purse
Bill Kammer gone, Shirley Franklin in
The GC closed down, Mike Chiles got ten
The feds locked the pimps up for pimpin in the south
You may control her mind, but you can't control her mouth
And these R&amp;B stars having sex with the kids
Need to be chopped up and castrated and served to the pigs
Oh yeah homeboy, you big time in yo state
But around here sucker, you get squeezed like grapes
This a word to the wise, the gravy get chunky
Somebody will pull that steel, throw it up an get funky
I got that Wayne rims, Winnie the Pooh and Mr. Miyagi
And horse tranquilizers that will fuck up your body
The wolves out hunting they looking for new meat
Better gather up your guns and keep yo chillin out the street
I said the mutant's out hunting, he looking for fresh meat
Better gather up your guns and keep yo chillin out the street, nigga

Step into a world (Klaka klaka, klaka klaka!)

But the very best (Klaka, bo bo, BDP crew, bo bo bo bo!)
No MC can test *cut and scratch of KRS saying &amp;amp;quot;but one&amp;amp;quot;*
Step into a world, where hip-hop is me
Where MC's and DJ's
Build up their skills as they play every day
For the, rapture

Yeah, what what!
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on!
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on!

Verse One:

I'm bout to hit you wit that tradional style of cold rockin
Givin options for head knockin non stoppin
Tip-toppin lyrics we droppin but styles can be forgotten
so we bring back the raw hip-hoppin
Just like the records and tapes you be coppin
Cop some breakdancin, boogie poppin, and lockin
Tic tockin, guaranteed to have you clockin
We only get better and only better we have gotten
This type of flow don't even think about stoppin
Beware, the length of the rhyme flow can be shockin
All music lovers in the place right now
That never understood the way that KRS got down
Yo I'm strictly about skills and dope lyrical coastin
Relying on talent, not marketing and promotion
If a dope lyrical flow is a must
You gots to go with a name you can quickly trust
I'm not sayin I'm number one, uhh I'm sorry, I lied
I'm number one, two, three, four and five
Stop wastin your money on marketing schemes
and pretty packages pushin dreams to the beams
A dope MC is a dope MC
With or witout a record deal, all can see
And that's who KRS be son
I'm not the run of mill, cause for the mill I don't run

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on!
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on!

Chorus

Verse Two:

Yeah, yeah
Everybody on the mic in the party sound alike
until I recite, in black and white what's right
Let me take flight, my style is TIGHT AN GOOD
TIGHT AN GOOD, come is it TIGHT AN GOOD
Old styles I pass dat, slow down on fast rap
All in yo' ass crack, old King go Blast dat
Conjure to ask dat, hyper type of flashback
I publish like ASCAP lyrics for hand clap
No past rappin, youth trackin, talent lackin
MC's more worried about their financial backin
Steady packin a gat as if something's gonna happen
But it doesn't, they wind up shootin they cousin, they buggin
I appear everywhere and nowhere at once
I know my style is bumpin, even though some people front
It's the God of rap, you heard of it
The one that rhymes toward the sky givin airplanes mad turbulence
In rap tournaments, I reign permanent
Don't you think by now the number one spot I'm not concerned with it
The course of rap I'm turnin it
Back to that good old fashioned way of getting cash money by earning it
No bogus hocus pocus, I bring back to focus
Skills if you notice my position is lotus
Now quote this, MC's are just hopeless
Thinkin record sales make them the dopest

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on!

Hey, don't miss out on what you're passing
You're missing the hootah
Of the funky buddha
Eluder
Of your fucked-up styles, I get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaws stridin'
While suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when you see me drivin'
By
Hanging out the window
With my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kind of loco
I'm just another local
Kid from the street getting paid from my vocals

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand

I'm ignoring all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothing is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fuckin' around my gat straight humming
Hummin', Coming at ya
Yeah ya know I had to gatt ya
Time for some action
Just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance
To run the interference
Into your satellite
Shining a battle light
Sen got the gatt and I know that he'll gatt you right
Here's an example
Just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome
I said, ""Yo, it's on!""
Take cover son or you're assed-out
How do you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did anyway
That young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I had to establish
To lite
My spliff ignite
You with insight
So if you ain't down, bullshit!
Say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would you call the One-time and play the role model?
No! I think you'll play like a thug
Next you hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming coming at ya
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gatt ya!
How you know where I'm at when you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm coming from
When you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome
Just for a bucket
Or a fast duck it
Just to stay alive, yo I got to say ""fuck it!""

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Check the fool or kick it in the tub
Cuz we kick much ass at the Playaz Club
I got a hoe named Real de Real
She got a buddy named SP-12 now you know the deal
We getz freaky in the studio late night
That's why the beats that you hear are comin real tight
Somethin to roll to somethin to stroll to
If you's a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script don't slip in the nine-fo
A lot of fools put salt in the game
Till these women get the notion that they runnin the game huh
I run my own and I'm my own self person
No respect make the situation worse then
Fillmoe, H.P., and Sunnydale
There's a playaz club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
A different part of town a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on the remote at the playaz club

(more champagne, Mr. Forte?)

From day one I had to get my money right
Me, Fly, and Franky J we took a airplane flight huh
They wanted to hear a rap I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote
a check
A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
Words out 4-Tay's out rappable
Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case
Suckas try to stop me from pursuin my paper chase
Cuz the chase is on because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop
So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way just in case you never heard
Rappin 4-Tay I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin off them suckas poppin off at the lip
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank bro

Leave the gat at the house bring some dominoes
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
And shoot your mackin at these women at the playaz club

(chorus)

You can't resist it but don't get it twisted
V.I.P. that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
Now homie what you all about?
I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's
Some got a nine-to-five some drink a lot of keys
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
Some of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer
A lot of people get a misconception
And start driftin in the wrong direction
Miss goody two sure see you later
I ain't got time you ain't nuthin but a playa hater
I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show another flow a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts
So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
Or else us and fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the playaz club

Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the playaz club

11846,11847,Lighter Shade Of Brown,On A Sunday Afternoon,Tuesday Afternoon,Jennifer Brown,"It started on a Tuesday afternoon
Josie was one of those easy girls who had wide eyes
And she was drawn in by the incense at the Mission Room Bar
You know, once she got in the boys attacked her like a movie star
And as soon as she got nervous she was drinkin� and smokin�
Like a lover caught chokin� on another man's bone
But clicking her heels wouldn't get her home
She called me laughin� from a pay phone

ON THIS TUESDAY AFTERNOON
JOSIE GOT CAUGHT IN THE MISSION ROOM
WHERE THE MEN ARE CRAZY AND THE WOMEN ARE,TOO
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT�S WEDNESDAY IN THE AFTERNOON
IN THE AFTERNOON

Just before 2:15 in the morning
Josie was doin� the Hustle with a ruffneck named James
And they were bumpin� and grindin� and grindin� and bumpin�
You know once you get there it's hard to stop the bass from pumpin�
And as soon as she was willing, Jimmy�s jeep was rollin�
And her lips were swollen from the fat shit she was tokin�
By 4 o'clock his waterbed was broken
She called me nervous from his cell phone

CHORUS

It ended on a Wednesday afternoon
Josie arrived at my apartment with mascara running down her cheeks
She was crying like a baby, saying, �What a mistake!�
I had to sit on my hands to keep them from slapping her face
'Cause as soon as I asked her if she used protection
I saw Josie�s complexion turn a shade of gray
Now what am I supposed to say?
Just don't party on a weekday

I'm puttin' in your face and U won't say 'Nada'
Vatos cholos you call as what you will
You say we are assessins si U wanna kill
Is it my brother be a nastyboy and go
Si en da street hold all betters
Chicanos and a brand I proud
Guantes chingazos simon se desquitan
Rigth now in the dirt
What's da matter? Are you afraid, you gonna get hurt?
I'm with my homeboys, --- my camaradas
Keepin' back my millaje, y pa mi no vale nada
Yo soy chingón ese

Crusin' en la calle, I hate for the bolo
No want to go with me, so I have to go solo
And when I go out alone... attack
I touch all that cheladas when I don't wanna absttrack
Everytime that I pack my piss, I pull all that quick
All the nazis desease
Just like a song when the 18 bullet
Got my finger on a triker, I'm not afraid to pull it
If this bara had a not say 'mafiosos'
When you pull it away, no seas stupid, eres baboso
Si en then don't you know what's happenin' que pasa... yeah...

11967,11968,New Boyz Featuring Ray J,Tie Me Down,Drag It Down,New Model Army,"They started work this morning down at city square
They're pulling down the statues of our great grandfather's hero
The new books said he wasn't such a great man after all
And anyway remember that the times they are a-changing

Ch: Pull it down, drag it down
Till there's nothing to look up to
But the brand names on the posters all around

They proved on television last night that God was just a lie
He never made the world at all
It was just some sweet old fashioned rite
So melt down all the ornaments, move out all the graves
And let us build the disco that we need for our young braves

Ch: Pull it down, drag it down
Till the hopes and dreams of all the ages
Past are shattered on the ground

We think we are so clever killing heroes, killing magic,
Until everything that's sacred is brought down to our level
for Mammon is a jealous master, - leaves no room for any other
All the questions left unanswered, all the answers gone forever
So bow to the woman in the finest fur
Bow to the man with the ace street cool
Bow to the woman with all the power
Bow to the man with all the money
In whose sight are we equal now?
Now that we've killed God",new boyz featuring ray j

Look at you like fuck you

Said I was gone but im still here
And all you bitches that left me here
Its mighty strange how you right back here

I wonder why love is about money
And why wou wanna take it all from me

Yall bitches don’t know
Money aint a thang

Girl im pitchin quarters
Closest to the arches but live in a fortress
New benzes new porsches
New cases new lawyers
im becoming the infamous notorious rule
Niggaz couldn’t walk a mile in my shoes
Niggaz don’t possess the heart that I do
And it’s a wonder that im still here
Thought I was gone but im still here
And all you bitches that left me here
Its kinda funny how you right back there

Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the 8th wonder of the world
The flow of the century.. oh it's timeless.. HOV'!
Thanks for comin out tonight
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with me
I appreciate that.. uuunnnh..

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was hurtin 'em in the home of the Terrapins; got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof -- vamoose, son of a bitch!

Holla at me...
I do this for my culture
To let 'em know what a nigga look like, when a nigga in a roaster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me I'm raisin the status quo up
I'm overchargin niggaz for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks so talk mo' bucks

[Jay-Z]
Yeah...
Hov' is back, life stories told through rap
Niggaz actin like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov' did that
so hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the pro-jects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back, sellin they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?
Cracks in my palm, watchin the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed in this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude, I gets bu-sy

God damn she's fine but she parties all the time

She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model

We all fall down...

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
Now the Ja shit i tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' Shug
Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it i understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cuz

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cuz once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his ressurection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cuz one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runion Avenue Soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
There ain't words that I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the virdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
If ya'll can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin'
Cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cuz

*Tuning TV*
*Eminem Snortin Crack

Tv Presenter:
Hello boys and girls
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy?
I'll bet you do

*Door opens*
who's your daddy?

Hailie:
Daddy, what're you doing?

Beat starts

Eminem:
Haha

Eminem &amp; Hailie:
Ok then! everybody, listen up!

Eminem:
I'm goin' to hell, who's comin' with me?

Hailie:
Somebody, please help him!
*giggle*
i think my dad gone crazy!

Verse #1:
There's no mountain i can't climb, there's no tower too high,
No plane that i can't learn how to fly
What do i gotta do to get through to you, to show you
There ain't nothing i can't take this chainsaw to
*Hailey Makes Chainsaw Sound* Fuckin' brains brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, then got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autograph,
Sunglasses with Elton John's name, on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fucking with hats off

Dr Dre:
Suck it Marshall

Eminem:
Tell laura and her husband to back off
Before i push this motherfucking button and blast off
And launch one of these russians, and that's all
*Hailie Makes Explosion Sound* Blow every fucking thing, except Afghanistan on the map, off
We wanna stop, we wanna knock the crap off
*Knocking* Haley, tell 'em baby

Haley:
My dad's lost it

Chorus:
Eminem:
There's really nothin' else to say ha, i can't explain it
Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!
Eminem:
A little help from Hailie jade won't ya tell em', maybe
Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!
Eminem:
Theres nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!
Eminem:
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
Hailie:
I think my dad gone crazy!

Verse 2:
It's like my mother always told me
*Eminem Impersinates His Mom* Rnrnrnrnrnrrrr, n codeine
n goddamit, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
Er.. Fuck that shit, bitch,
eat a motherfuckin' dick Chew on a prick, and lick
a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring
in my nose then quit bringin' my flos,
Quit giving me my ammo Can't you see why i'm so
mean? if y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man i don't know no more
Am i the only fuckin' one who's normal any more?

Hailey:
Dad!

Chorus

Verse #3:
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
And at the same time, make you dry your eyes
with the same rhyme - so what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinter-
pret it at first, cuz when i speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
before i'd ever bite my tongue I'd slice my gums,
get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as vanilla ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time i sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as bump n' grind comes on
More pain inside o' my brain,
than in the eyes of a little girl inside of a plane
aimed at the world trade, standin' on Ronny's grave,
Screaming at the sky, the clouds gather its Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter, heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, i wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

Chorus

Poppin' and moving your body all night long
My jewels get bigger when you giving me dome
And I get a little crazy when its time to bone
My life made you think I was one of a kind
And my ice made you think that love was blind
Seperate the great, from the weak freaks
I would never hate, I love all my freaks
But I never love a hoe, never let a hoe know that
That I gotta lot of dough, she ain't gotta know
Take it to the room, I don't need your voice

She got one of yo kids got you for 18 years
I know somebody payin child support for one of his kids
His baby momma car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was s'pose to buy you shorty TYCO with your money
She went to the doctor got lypo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Should of got that insured GEICO for your money
If you aint no punk
holla 'We Want Prenup' 'WE WANT PRENUP! Yeaah!'
It's something that you need to have
Cause when she leave your ass she gone leave with half
18 years, 18 years
And on her 18th birthday he found out it wasn't his

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Now I ain't sayin you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You got out to eat and he can't pay, ya'll cant leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But why ya'll washin' watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look in his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So, stick by his side
I know his dude's ballin, but yeah thats nice
And they gone keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right girl
And when you get on, he leave your ass for a white girl

Chorus

You just came home from doing a bid
Tell me what you gonna do? Act a fool
Somebody broke in and cleaned out your crib
Boy whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
Just bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes
Tell me what you gonna do? Act a fool
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues
Boy whatcha gonna do? Act a fool

Verse 1

Talkin' about gats, traps, cops and robbers
It's 911 please call the doctor
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
Since everybody wanna piece of me, we gon split ya wigs
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped their boundaries
You about to catch a cold, stay the f**k around from me
Ya peeps talkin' 'bout what kinds of shits he on
You dissapear like poof bitch be gone
You think you gon catch me, gimmie a break
I'm super-charged with the hide-away licence plate
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimmie some years
They'll only get 1 finger while I'm shifting gears
I got sued on my roof, wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug, golde grain on the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride
We go front, back and side to side, what

Chorus

Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink
Tell me what you gonna do? Act a fool
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
Boy whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me what you gonna do? Act a fool
If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob
Boy whatcha gonna do? Act a fool

Verse 2

Let's take it to the street cause I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With the pedal to the floor, radar in the grill
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in my trunk than my ride can handle


Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I roll up to da club, I get all the affection
Cause the women love the paintin they can see their reflection
I'm about to take off, F what you heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a f**kin' bird
And the fools, we gon clock one and we'll pop one
Cause my folk ridin' shotgun with a shotgun

Chorus

You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
Now them girls up the block still running their mouth
Boy whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
If anyone talk bad about the dirty south
Tell me whatcha gonna do? Act a fool

Verse 3

I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the street still smokin'
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
Off the off ramp doin' about 250
Rollin' through East Pernium, on way to Ben Hill
Slide a 5 to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin' some shit
I even got a trailer hitched with the barbeque pit
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is fabio cause we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees and bees, that's fantastic
So girls hold ya weaves while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
You'll be like Lil' John Q and get a change of heart
It's 1 mission, 2 clips and some triple beams
I'm about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens

Chorus

The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
Man, that ain't sticky, that's just sticks and steams
Boy whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
Catch a man with another bitch up in ya bed
Ladies whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
If the bottles all gone and your eyes are red
Boy whatcha gonna do? Act a fool

All the fans, I'd like to thank, thank you really though

Cause I remember yesterday when I dreamt about the days
When I'd rock on MTV, that be really dope
Damn, It's been a long road and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know.

A lotta them be wishin' that they was in my position
A lotta niggas be cowards and most chicks be chickens
Fuck 'bout the CLUCK! CLUCK! Eve ain't trippin'
Most dudes is okay, half of the rest ain't
Talkin' 'bout what they wanna do, reality they can't
Ask 'em what they life worth, watch 'em draw a blank
I really ain't got no interest if it don't involve the bank
Most of the time I'm nice to 'em, half the time I'm not
It ain't nothin' new though, learned it from off the block
People think I changed much 'coz I'm livin' good
Now they get my voicemail, hear them callin' me rude?
Sometimes I feel bad, most of the time I don't

Stressed when we in the same places 'till I leave
Whisper to they friends what they wanna do to me
Wish they could erase me, take away the air I breathe
And I feed 'coz that shit only give me hunger pains
Never let you muhfuckas put out my flame
Ready for whatever, was trained to maintain
And I always been a savage 'bout the fame
Separate the girls from the women and the winnin'
Always knew the thrill was worth it from the beginnin'

I caught you on that cut with Wyclef man you were boomin
But I caught these foul slouch ass niggaz youknowmean?
Talkin foul bout you the other night
on the corner of the boulevard man I wasn't with that
but I ain't know you well enough to defend you though right?
But you seem like you got true game
But.. peep game man, they've been playin me all my life man
You know I won the title a couple of times, did right, youknowmean?
But they can't hurt us man, we gon' do it
Get up in this ring man put on these gloves
Let me show how to handle yourself man
You don't got nobody out there with you
I gots to show you man, get up in there move that head man
Come on to me man, but when you come man you gotta come for blood man
Come up to me man, come on bust that nigga whole man
Niggaz talkin that shit about you..

Hey Mike Tyson here speakin with the Canibus man over here
Yo Canibus your main objective out here is to do nuttin but
eat eat eat eat MC's, for lunch, breakfast
Hey man they been playin me all my life man
You know I won the title a couple of times did right
No but they can't hurt us man
We gonna do it, get up in this ring man, put on these gloves
Let me show you how to handle this yourself man

[Canibus]
So I'ma let the world know the truth, you don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, somethin that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you +Platinum+, you only droppin +Clue's+
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes, bout how you used to sniff coke
Frontin like a drug-free role model, you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showin off your body cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me cause I kick that shit real niggaz feel
While 99% of your fans wear high heels
From Ice-T to Kool Moe Dee to Jay-Z
Now you wanna fuck with me? You must be crazy!
You drippin with wack juice, and you can't get it off
You betta be prepard to finish what you start, nigga

[Referee]
Hey hey hey hey, you just hold it right there
(Yo, get off me man)
We got an illegal low blow on the fighter in the blue trunks
(Yo, yo get the fuck off me man)
If I see one more of those, you're outta here brotha
(Yo get out my way man, yo he started this shit)
You understand? (Fuck you!)
You'll be disqualified (I'll bite that nigga again!)
Stop bein a bitch (Get the fuck off me man!)
We came to see a fight

[Mike Tyson]
Yo Canibus man you gotta hit harder than that man
You don't want no bitch ass niggaz hangin out wit me man
We're warriors man, when we go into battle
we come out, or don't come out at all

[Canibus]
Yo
You better give me the respect that I deserve or I'ma take it by force
Blast you with a 45 colt, make you summersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk
It's about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first
That's why I laugh when I hear that wack ass verse
That shit was the worse [pause] rhyme I ever heard in my life
cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th
God bless his soul rest in peace kid
It's because of him now at least I know +What Beef+ is
It's not what I would call this (nah) see this is somethin different
A faggot nigga tryin ta make a livin offa dissin
Somebody that he gotta know is betta than him
but he feelin himself, cause he got more cheddar than him
Well lemme tell you somethin, you might got mo' cash then me
But you ain't got the skills to eat a nigga's ass like me
And if you really want to show off, we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll let you kick a verse, fuck it, I'll let you kick em all
I'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud [cheers]
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom your 1st, 2nd and 3rd born
Make your wife get on the horn call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it, I saw naw he started it
He forgot what a hardcore artist is
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man, such as myself
trained to run 20 miles in soft sand
On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars off hand
from a lost and forgotten land, you done did it man
You done spitted some wack shittit
And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'll forget it
Fuck that, cause like Common and Cube I see +The Bitch In Yoo+
and I'ma make the world see it too, motherfucker

And I think everyone's got a fuckin' problem with me, dude ...
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because

But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

So I get off stage right? and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
What's up ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12, baby
They're all like ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh, my fuckin' God, it's Eminem
I swear to fuckin' God, dude, you fuckin' rock
Please won't you please let me suck your cock""
Now by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think you're trynna steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
Because I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me

Hey dad how come we don't rap off Pro Tools?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, yous a liar
And no, I'm Swift (""Oh, I thought you was Kuniva"")
What the hell is wrong with that dressing room?
Cause our shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, (uh-huh) it's simple but,
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, trynna get on the map
Doin' jumpin' jacks while get whipped on my back

(Verse 4- Proof)
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Once we sold out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gonna let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Eminem: Ay, yo what's....)
Ready to stap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear,
(""Hey dude, I love your band"")
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
And these guys they can find every area code
(Eminem: Proof, carry my bag)
Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(""Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!"")

(Verse 5- Bizarre)
God dammit, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Till Kon Artis slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video, I was in the back
Superman video, I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like ""Who's D12?"" ""How we get started?""
(""But what about Eminem?"")
Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Bigass stomach, bitches think I'm cute
(""Hey sexy"")
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and then I couldn't get up (Uhh!)
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

(Eminem)
Girl why can't you see you're the only one for me
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my name

(Chorus- Bizarre - {Bizarre also})
Man, fuck this
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (ha ha)
But they all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)
Cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man (yeah)
All because I'm the lead singer......

I'm the lead singer of my band, I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa(wooo ohhh), look out for my next single, it's called ""My Salsa""
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa

And take off their underpants

Let's get up, let's get down
Roll wit the hardcore funk, the hardcore sound
Let's get wit this, mackadocious funk material
So simple, when I rock wit the instrumental
Who am I (E-D the Green Eyed Bandit)
Control my career so I can never get stranded
But the rest are gettin Brand Nubian
Changed up they style, from jeans to suits and
Thinkin about a pop record, somethin made for the station
For a whole new relation-
ship of a new type of scene
To go platinum and clock mad green
AKA, a sellout, the rap definition
Get off that boy, change your mission
Come back around the block
Pump Color Me Badd to the ah, tick tock
Let them know your logo, not a black thing
My background sing, my background sing for the crossover

The Crossover

(PMD)
The rap era's outta control, brother's sellin their soul
To go gold, going, going, gone, another rapper sold
(To who) To pop and R&amp;amp;amp;B, not the MD
I'm strictly hip-hop, I'll stick to Kid Capri
Funk mode, yea, kid, that's how the Squad rolls
I know your head is bobbin cuz the neck knows
(Not like other rappers) frontin on they fans, the ill
Trying to chill, saying &amp;amp;quot;damn, it be great to sell a mill&amp;amp;quot;
Thats when the mind switch to the pop tip
(Kid, you're gonna be large)
Yea right, that's what the company kicks
Forget the black crowds, you're wack now
In a zoot suit, frontin black lookin mad foul
I speak for the hardcore (ruff, rugged and raw)
I'm outta here, catch me chillin on my next tour
From the US to the white cliffs of Dover
Strictly underground funk, keep the crossover

The crossover

(Erick Sermon)
(So what cha sayin) You wanna go pop goes the weasel
You know you should be rocking the fans wit something diezel
But you insist to piss me off black
So I flex the biceps so I can push em back
So real hardcore hip-hop continue wreck it
And all sucker MC's duck down and get the message
So ban the crossover, yo, who's wit me
(Hit Squad) yea, P, hit me

(PMD)
Another megablast, funky dope style from cross yonder
(So help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda)
(Yo, from what) the crossover, yea crossing you over
Outta here, gone, peace, nice to know ya (see ya)
What a way to go out, no clout is what the fans will shout
Cuz you got gassed and took the wrong route
Came on the scene, chillin, freakin a funky dope line
But when they finish wit you (beep) flatline
Some say there's no business like show business
But if this the truth, please explain why is this
Rappers been around long, makin mad noise you see
Still I haven't seen one rapper livin comfortably
No time to pick and wish on a four leaf clover
I stick to underground, keep the crossover

I just felt like telling the story of my life. Felt like maybe
Somebody would be inspired ya know. We all feel pain. We
all go through things But it's time to overcome all of that.

VERSE 1: Your plane crashed down in the water and everybody died
Would you drown on purpose or try to survive?
I was born handicapped my arm wouldnt move
They called me a cripple, pops caught and attitude
Beat moms smoke lots drove trucks
My moms had a miscarriage he didnt give a f**k
He sniffed some coke come home he beat up moms for talking on the phone

CHORUS: All I ever wanted all I ever needed was a father
Thats all (THATS ALL)
All I ever wanted All I ever needed waaaaas (WAS A FATHER) was a father

VERSE 2: Moms got tired of the beatings said ""yo we gots to go""
Packed up the bags we bounced out the door
She said ""I aint take these whippings no more I wanna live to see my little child grow""
I remember tear drops on my pops face
Looking down at me standing at me on the staircase
Hand to mother with a smooth goatee Make me wonder we he acted so ugly
Ya feelin me? (ya feelin me?)

REPEAT CHORUS

VERSE 3: My pops got drunk when me and my moms bounced
Swigged some Jack Dans siffed up an ounce
Grab the shot he left long out for Queens
Possessed by a demon... A devil it seemed
I was too young to understand the risks when
your moms comes home from a midnight shift.
she turned around hear the shotgun click
My pops said ""you think you can leave me?"" (Leave me?)
He blasted my moms in the back she fell down screaming I cant forget that
My Grandfather tried to close the door
He got shot 10 times in the stomach YO. Fo real

REPEAT CHORUS

VERSE 4: My head was spinning I aint never seen blood
4 years old this dont feel like love
Anyway Pops disappeared
Grandpops and moms healed up over the years
This therapist got up in her head
Led her to believe that without him she's be dead
You know they fell in love with one another
Everything seemed righ thats word to mother (Word to mother)
Until i started getting beatings everyday
sometimes for going outside to play
Late at night on my knees i'd pray
Young child wishing the pain would go away
Dad where was you when he made me strip
Beat me wit belts like a slave wit a whip
Kicked me down steps outside in the snow
Punched me in the chest knocked me out on the floor
Thats just the tip of the iceburg look
its too long for a song
but perfect it for a book
Word is bond, thats real baby

When I'm rocking the table while he's operating ""Hey""
You waited this long to stop debating
Cuz I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating

But your husbands heart problem is complicated

Or let me be me so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me

Fuck that cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready cuz this shit's about to get heavy

Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prison is helpless,
Til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary, could start a revolution,
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and bask,
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me?
Well I'm back fix your bent antenna
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter
Into the front of your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
Testing ""Attention Please""

Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards,
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie,
You 36 year old bald headed fag blow me
You don't know me, you're too old
Let go, it's over, nobody listens to techno
Now lets go, just give me the signal
I will be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems,
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm dis-gus-ting,
But its just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley,
To do Black Music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing,
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child and what bothers him all comes out,
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him, so he socked him back,
And broke his nose his house is a broken home,
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go...

[Verse 2]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate,
I guess words are a mothafucka they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have,
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me,
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously,
so i'm signin' cd's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
It's all political, if my music is literal,
and i'm a criminal how the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to,
you're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you...

Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me now, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you, and cock it too?
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus
But music is reflection of self, we just explain it,
And then we get our checks in the mail - It's fucked up ain't it?
How we can come from practically nothing
to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it,
Squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone just let our spirits live on,
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...

Eminem:
They call me superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound,
I'm single now,
Got no ring on this finger now,
I'll never let another chick bring me down,
In a relationship, save it bitch, babysit? you make me sick,
Superman aint savin shit, girl you can jump on shady's dick,
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase,
I'll tell a m'fuckin slut to her face,
Play no games, say no names,
ever since I broke up with what's her face,
I'm a different man, kiss my ass, kiss my lips, bitch why ask?
Kiss my dick, hit my cash, i'd rather have you whip my ass,
Don't put out? i'll put you out,
Won't get out? i'll push you out,
Puss blew out, copin shit,
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out,
Am I too nice? buy you ice,
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life,
What you tryin to be, my new wife?
What you Mariah? fly through twice,
But I do know one thing though,
Bitches they come, they go,
Saturday through Sunday monday,
Monday through Sunday yo,
Maybe i'll love you one day,
Maybe we'll someday grow,
Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin runway hoe...

Chorus:
'Cuz I can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
I can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
Can't be your superman,
Your superman, your superman...

Eminem:
Don't get me wrong,
I love these hoes,
It's no secret,
Everybody knows,
Yeah we fucked
Bitch so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes,
We'll be friends,
I'll call you again,
I'll chase you around every bar you attend,
Never know what kind of car i'll be in,
We'll see how much you'll be partying then,
You don't want that,
Neither do I,
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys,
Too much pride,
Between you and I,
Not a jealous man, but females lie,
But I guess that's just what sluts do,
How could it ever be just us two?
I never loved you enough to trust you,
We just met and I just fucked you,
But I do know one thing though,
Bitches they come they go,
Saturday through Sunday monday,
Monday through Sunday yo,
Maybe I'll love you one day,
Maybe we'll someday grow,
'Till then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin runway hoe...

Verse 1:

I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable
he mistaked me for somebody who was liable
for all tha many murders l.a and war fields
we keep makin war shields
streets keep souls
young brothers loose control
I seem to maintain through this
watch where ya kick it they'll put you in a twist
and it aint nobody like my down ass hommie
and tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me
I keep away from fools
they do crime and it attracts cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in

--ChorUs--

Verse 2:

They tryin' to stick with some bullshit that I did not do
you know who
the boys in blue
there they go with they assumpitons
slaverys over let us have somethin'
why you wanna pull me over?
'cause I'm bumpin?


I just made a new song
my profession is music
your profession is protection with gats
then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today
so I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
cops got guns and cuffs
and cells to stuff you in

--Chorus--

Verse 3:

I shot the sheriff
I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to
'cause in this game they always tryin' to blast you
and leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder
they harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man
the hommie day-dog got strapped but thats okay
'cause I'm gonna work for life
so he can see another day
a hommies a hommie
a fake is a snake
straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake
so I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops

Niggas is out there holding until I see niggas,
Niggas is out there holding,
Starving nigga, fuck that, I'm a broke nigga,
And I gotta see any nigga out here holding something,
Fuck that.

Everyday, me and my son stay scheming,
On how to maximise the level on day to day creaming,
While you remain faking,
Yo, I ain't tolerating, no mistaking,
We on the move to study paper-making,
Round up the whole squad quick,
Plot the scheme with my niggas, get on some full clip bullshit,
Before I solidify manslaughter, my unit form on the streetcorner,
We suprise like fiends in disguise,
Laying for the right shit so I can receive another grand prize,
Greeting niggas like a homeless nigga,
The way it happened son, you'd never figure,
How the homeless nigga gun is much bigger,
Now give me everything you walking with and everything your man is holding,
Even the watch that got the platinum moulding,
And as the situation start unfolding,
You scared to death you little bitch, go ahead,
Report it stolen, see what happen...

(Crazy fighting going on, mad punches, smashed glass etc.)

Cocks drwan nigga, holding my dick,
Wilding for the night, splurging with my click from the fit,
Open like a motherfucker, itching and ready to do the next stick,
Get any my nigga Dit can pick,
What you said I said even if it causing bloodshed,
Getting paid for even if we robbing a fucking chickenhead,
Word to mother son, I ain't fronting,
I'm taking everything I been always wanting,
So I continue to peep out, in the jam will be the most blidded,
Rob 'em in the corner bounce to the bar with they money and buy drinks with
it,
I stay on some real trife shit, test your life shit or even stab you on some
knife shit,
Fake it if you wanna fake it, if I see it, then I want it, then I take it,
Leaving niggas ass naked,
Sometime I know it seems so shocking,
How you the next victim to be listening of the sounds of a trigger cocking,
All in your ears, cold steel all against your face,
I feel your blood chilling, your heart racing at a rapid pace,
And if you thinking that's strong,
I dare you even to flinch wrong, fuck around,
You feel the full five long,
The victim contemplating what to do,
Or how the fuck top get out of the situation that he's going through,
This nigga tried to grab the gat, you know I started clapping,
Bet y'all niggas wanna know how the rest of the story happened...

Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo bust it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me dial the beeper number baby when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn, you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I get around

What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know

[Shock G]
Now you can tell from my everday fits, I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me, I get around

[Money B]
What's up love, how you doing? (All right)
Well I've been hanging sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging
Your home girl you went to school with, that's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know, that I get around

Tupac and them down don't stop for hoes, I get around
Why I ain't call you? Ha ha, please

Finger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone til the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clown, baby doll are you down?

I'll take you frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumpin' shall we singin' it
O is for Other, P is for People...scratch yo temple
The last P Well...that's not that simple
It's sorta like a, well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that I'm missin' here
You get it on occassion if the other party
isn't game'n it seems I gotta start the explainin'
Bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number then left feelin' real mellow
You get home, wait a day, she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend's or her cousin's house
It's not a front, an F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house (Boy, that's what is scary)
It's OPP, some other people's pu... You get it?
There's no room for relationships there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm gettin' at?

As for the ladies, OPP means something gifted
The first two letters are the same but the last is something
different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean-- I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhymin' with cleanness and meanness
I won't get into that, I'll do it...uh...sorta properly
I'll say the last P...hmm...stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me, now tell me
exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife
And you just had to stop and just 'cos he look just as nice
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
He had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him and honestly you didn't care
'Cos in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do'
Now don't be shocked 'cos if you're down I want your hands up high

Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with it, discount

I had a girl and she knew that, matter-of-fact, hell, my girl was partners

Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me, so we did it in my apartment, bust it
That wasn't the thing, it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
'Cos after that she kept on coming back and catchin' feelings
I said, ""Let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you Treach"" I said, ""Now child please""
You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said I'll look you to the stairs and to the stair window
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have brought your heart
'Cos you knew I was OPP, hell from the very start
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round runnin' off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this OPP establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta OPP visit with him or her
For sure, I'm going to admit it: When OPP comes,
Damn skippy, I'm wit' it

When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace.
I told God I'd be back in a second,
Man It's so hard not to act reckless.
To whom much is given much is tested.
Get arrested, guess until, they get the message.
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny,
and what I do? act more stupidly.
bought more jewelry, more louis v, my mama couldn't get through to me.
The drama, people suing me,
I'm on T.V. talking like it's just you and me.
I'm just saying how I feel man,
I ain't one of the Cosby’s I ain’t go to Hill man
I guess the money should've changed him,
I guess I should've forgot where I came From.

But I couldn't tell you who decide wars.
So I parallel double parked that muthafucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homey this is my day.
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
You know I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it.

They say I talk with so much emphasis,
They're so sensative.
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
Say something were you gone end up apologing.
Let me know if it's a problem man,
Alright man, holla then.

Let that man get past.
You don't need a stop to get gas,
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off the fumes cuzz
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul,
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold.
Treasure. What's you pleasure?
Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her.
So if the devil wear Prada,
Adam Eve wear Nada,
I'm in between, but way more fresher.
With way less effort, 'cause when you try hard,
That's when you die hard.

You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day (hey!)
I'm rocking and you're yawning
But you never look my way (hey!)
I'm licking down you darling
In every single way (hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign and a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your Head 'n Shoulders
Brother older bold enough to fold ya
Yo, I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made
and played em plus a funky fit
So save ya flips and tricks
Put that music in the monkey bit

Triggas from the Grill town Ill town
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what ya thinkin' cause I'm vampin'

Being lowdown
I do the showdown with any little ho' 'round (NO!)
I wanna know who you're believing
Through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleepin' you think I'm cheating
You said I know you're mister O.P.P man
You P.P man
Won't only see me man
You should've know that I ain't hitting the step
That I was with it a bit
Not to consider the rep (Heck!)
I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker
Cause I'm Naughty By Nature
Not cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark

You try to act like something really big is missing
Even though my name's graffiti written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way

One reason Hip Hop's the top today

Ain't chopping no crop
But still growing every day

Fools get foolish neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitty's purr
Now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew
Any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof

Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly cause hip hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue-suede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era?
Was fresh and fat since they started sayin audi
Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie

Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steering column on your Impala

In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later until these women can't stand
straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
Brush my shoulder and I pop my collar
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars

And why they never get it poppin' but they party to death
Yea, and why they gon give you life for a murder
Turn around only give you eight months for a burner, it's goin down
Why they sellin' niggaz CD's for under a dime
If it's all love daddy why you come wit your nine
Why my niggaz ain't get that cake
Why is a brother up North better than Jordan
That ain't get that break
Why you ain't stackin' instead of tryin' to be fly
Why is rattin' at an all time high
Why are you even alive
Why they kill Tupac n' Chris
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin Crist'
Why them bullets have to hit that door

Why you gotta do eighty-five percent of your time

Why a nigga always want what he can't have
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag
Why did crack have to hit so hard
Even though it's almost over
Why niggaz can't get no jobs
Why they come up wit the witness protection

Yeah, turn me up yeah

(Verse 2)
What if somebody from the Chi-town was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't to cool for the safe belt
I swear to God driver two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep my safe book safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
it was televised
There`s been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

(In background)
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For chance to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come my way
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

Know what im saying
When the doctor told me I had a um.. I was goin to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
Its bad I got all this jewelry on

And now they - switch to fades and I'm thinkin 'bout braids
Just an example of hoochieless jackin
If we were hoopin, I'd be yellin ""They hackin""
I see you momma, in my Dolce Gabbana
Gucci and Prada baby I gotta lotta
The lucciana ain't a problem for poppa
That's all you want then baby girl I'ma holla
Cause you wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You really wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?

Uh, hear me out now
Now your pimp juice is anything, attract the opposite sex
It could be money, fame, or straight intellect
It don't MATTER! Bitches got the pimp juice too
Come to think about it - dirty, they got more than we do
They got mo' - juice in they talk, got mo' juice in they walk
They got mo' - juice in they pants, OOH GOD DAMN!
I tell you man it's a cryin shame..
.. how people use, the juice in vain - you hear me mayne
Pimp juice is color blind
You find it work on all color creeds and kinds
From ages 50 right down to 9
The Mayor of Nellyville and I won't resign, watch me recline
Cause you wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You really wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You're in a hurry - SLOW DOWN - bitch I got all night
Matter fact, stand on my left boo - I know you ain't right

To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, BLOW!
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stacked that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't collapse on him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, god only knows he's grown farther from home
He's no father, he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this mothafuckin' roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin', stepped writin' the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cuz, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mikhai Pfeiffer
This is my life, and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
Teetertotter caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin' on and too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothafuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go with my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go

Some where inside my childhood I missed my heart die
And even though we both came from tha same places
Tha money and tha fame made us all change places
Could it be through tha misery
That came to past ,
the hard times make a true friend afraid to ask,
for currency,
but u could run to me when u need me,
i'll never leave honestly someone to believe in as u can see.
this is our thang through and true
What can I do real homies help you get through
And comin' new he'd do tha same thang if he could
Cuz in tha hood true homies make you feel good
And happy times we be actin' up call tha cops
Bringin' tha cease to tha peace that was on my block
It never stop, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah but it's clear I'll always be tha same

Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know I don't hang around tha house much
This all night money makin' got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of tha ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my low-low
Watchin' tha whole world move in slow mo
For quiet times I disappear and listen to tha ocean
Smokin' pots think my thoughts
Then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world
My phony homie had a baby by my own girl
But I ain't trippin' I'm a playa
I ain't sweatin' him
I his sister had her mo' good like a Mexican

No remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rappin' tha only thing I did good was scrappin'

Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
To live my life,
As an Outlaw all alone
Remain strong in this planet full of playa hataz
They conversate 'bout Death Row full of demonstrators
And in tha end drinkin' henessey made all my enemies envy me
So go when I flow eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for their right to breath
While beggin' me to keep tha peace haha
Well I can see close into achieve
In times of danger don't freeze time to be a G
Follow my lead I supply everything you need
An ounce of game and tha trainin' to make a G'

Buried as a G' while tha whole world remembers me

Gotta keep the ratchet close by
Someone murdered, nobody seen, nobody heard it
Just another funeral service
Niggas will get at you, come through shinin' they yap you
In broad day light kidnap you
Feds get clapped too, police stay on us like tattoos
Niggas only grind cause we have to
Money is power, sling crack, weed and powder
Fiends come through every hour
It's about that dollar and we nuh deal with cowards
Weak lambs get devoured by the lion
In the concrete jungle, the strong stand and rumble
The weak fold and crumble, it's the land of trouble

Better say quick who you close to
Don't come through if niggas don't know you
Cuz people is talkin', the streets is watchin'

Also known as a rap wrecka, not a rhyme rebel

True beaters, minerals and rhymes survive lyrics
Like the acre without the attic, but not the only Asiatic

Hoe don't kick that mumbo jumbo...

With the megadrunken, style to keep the crowd pumpin
Niggaz lookin at me like, 'Tash is up to somethin'

Bury me by my grand-grand and when you can, come follow me

God bless you working on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days, GOD is who we praise
even though the devil's all up in my face
But he keeping me safe and in my place, say grace
For the case to race with a chance to face the judge
And I betcha my soul won't budge

Can I get a witness let it unfold

I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

I got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's ""Money, Cash, Hoes""
I'm from the hood stupid, what type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin dough
I'm like fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
they don't play my hits - well I don't give a shit, SO!
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers!
I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
I'm from, rags to riches, niggaz I ain't dumb

The year is ninety-four, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin law
Got two choices y'all, pull over the car or (hmm)
bounce on the Devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin to see no highway chase with Jay
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I, pull over to the side of the road
I heard ""Son do you know what I'm stoppin you for?""
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
Or do I look like a mindreader sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo'?
""Well you was doin fifty-five in a fifty-four;
license and registration and step out of the car -
are you carryin a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are""
I ain't steppin out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack! You some type of lawyer or somethin, somebody important or somethin""
Child I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well we'll see how smart you are when the canine comes""

A nigga like myself had to strongarm a hoe
This is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy
But a pussy havin no God damn sense, try an' push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin and
he and his boys gon' be yappin to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin them
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mill' for bail cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin them
Tryin to play the boy like he's saccharin
But ain't nuttin sweet bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems but and a bitch ain't one - hit me!

and none shall escape, what me say

Boy you better put on the wings of de morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Flying on the income must fall to the sea
There is no escape from his Majesty

[Verse One:]

A long time he a tell you bout the duttie square breed
A long time he a tell you bout the brutality
A long time he a tell you bout the him fantasy

But why yo, I vote with equality
But why yo, a-bout Marcus Garvey
We there yo, I feel love his Majesty
Selassie I, soul that kept me

On these New York streets like baby what
Anything can happen, it usually does

If you put-ta on de wings and tempt to exit
Then no conjure Christ and none gone bullshit
Ay Selai for the righteous but the wicked are to perish
With them burn the gun and them whole poli-tricks
Half the people dem a turn and half the people dem a twist
Now shoot dem, another ear-trick done perish
Get M some 16 and some rusty-matic
After the whole of them from gone then push up them fists
Leave the ship them a strip, you must get punish
Go ahead, speed up your judgment, stand up boy boy

And black-skinned, original Don set the trend

(One) day when I was chillin' in Kentucky Fried Chicken
Just mindin' my business, eatin' food and finger lickin'
This dude walked in lookin' strange and kind of funny
Went up to the front with a menu and his money
He didn't walk straight, kind of side to side
He asked this old lady, &amp;amp;quot;Yo, yo, um...is this Kentucky Fried?&amp;amp;quot;
The lady said &amp;amp;quot;Yeah&amp;amp;quot;, smiled and he smiled back
He gave a quarter and his order, small fries, Big Mac!
You be illin'

Verse 2

(To)day you won a ticket to see Doctor J
Front row seat (in free!) no pay
Radio in hand, snacks by feet
Game's about to start, you kickin' popcorn to the beat
You finally wake up, Doc's gone to town
Round his back, through the hoop, then you scream &amp;amp;quot;Touchdown!&amp;amp;quot;
You be illin'

Verse 3

The other day around the way I seen you illin' at a party
Drunk as skunk you illin' punk and in your left hand was Bacardi
You went up to this fly girl and said &amp;amp;quot;Yo, yo, can I get this dance?&amp;amp;quot;
She smelt your breath and then she left you standin' in your illin'
stance
You be illin'

Hangin in the hood, just shootin the breeze
My partners on the cut smokin swisher sweets
Trippin on the hoochies rollin by in they rides
Guzzlin up a forty ounce of cold St. Ides
Jammin to a tape to my partner had made
'Growin' up in the Hood' bein mixed with Face
Swisher sweet's a killer, feelin nothin but nice
Reached in my pocket for the old school dice
Pulled out a knot and dropped the dice on the flo'
And asked my partner Mike what they hittin fo'
Pulled out a yard and said, &amp;quot;We bettin a dove&amp;quot;
Tee Lee Baby, show your partner some love
Kickin back fadin, put the flame to the joint
3-2, drop baby, 3-2's your point
Back in the do' with a fo' and a ace
Picked up his ends and waved the dice in my face
And then he hollered out &amp;quot;School house!&amp;quot;
Schooled em again, now d's come in ounce
And walked away from the crap game broke
But it ain't no thing, yo - just let a brother smoke

Back on the creep after losin some change
Seen my partner [Name], Big Chief and James
Creepin on the boulevard, actin a fool
Trippin on the broads at the old school
Music bumpin hard, never turnin it down
Trunk super tight with surround-by sound
Paint job crackin cause the punch ain't fade
Jammin that brand new 2Low tape
Windows all smokey, blowin coke-laced seed
I'm throwin up the deuce to the HPD
Now they lookin crazy like I sold the hay
Just another day in the heart of S.A.
Roll a little further there, I seen O.G.
With his brother named [Name], S.A. O.G.
They chopped up the hood, so I'm chunkin it back
And then they pulled out a $200 sack
When I saw it I almost choked
Twist your partner one, big baby, just let your partner smoke

5th Ward in the house with the S.A. fools
Ain't no set trippin cause we all so cool
Drinkin up the bottle, gettin drunk as a skunk

Hit the stage and grabbed the mic and started flexin styles
A stage full of tight MC's goin buckwild

Sippin Seagram, chewin on a weed stem
Touchin on my fo' fin
Move it to the back so I can see who beepin this Po Pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with 3-1-2-7-6-2-10
Three line connection, as the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the weed, we got the drinks you need
And plus we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
Cause I forgot where I met the hoe
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes wanna snap
I straight up check the hoe, really doe, to the crib

cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
peanut butter complex and some pretty eyes
Pity cries on my strategy side, yo when outta me gotta be

I know you wanna try it out, to the rhythm of a high hat
Don't be bogus and deny that
I done got a hold of dem my fellas on the train
while she lie back, now motherfucker can you bow down?
Where your ride at? On the passenger side of your hoes
Tryin ta come up on another G
The broad all up under me tryin ta smother me
Lookin love-ly while I roll another bead, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room she rubbin me with lotion
Comin' like an ocean coastin have a cig thinking
Me and Do or Die dig drinkin love potion
The word that was never said
Twisted be givin women dick in the bed
Until they sick in the head, and if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't trickin the Feds or spittin' game
But it's chicken and bread
Kickin them legs in the air like a playa do
Then be little in a day or two
After words I'm slay a crew, now that's some pimp type shit

And then I get a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost

And you can see my heart.. beating
You can see it through my chest
I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger.....

As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering if I will ever see another sunrise
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's to late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart.. beating
You can see it through my chest
I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger.....",rihanna

See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive

[Verse 1: Nas]
Let's go!... Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey --
Tribrary of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
'Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging The Gap from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo
[Olu Dara singing]
Greatest man alive (Nas: Yeah, turn it up!)
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!

[Verse 2: Nas]
The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
'Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
'Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, &amp;quot;Mr. Jones please come get your child
'Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild&amp;quot;
[Olu Dara singing]
Greatest man – The great-greatest man alive

[Verse 3: Nas]
Hey-Hey-Hey -- My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone
He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home
Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu
Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to
[Olu Dara singing]
I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique
Madagascar, Paris, Greece
The Middle Africa is where we lived
Better known as Queenbridge
[Nas]
Nas, Nas you don't stop
Olu Dara in the house, you don't stop
Muddy Waters' Howling Wolf you don't stop
From the Blues to Street Hop you don't stop
Tell 'em Pop

[Outro: Olu Dara singing / Nas adlibbing]
See I come from Mississippi (Let 'em know)
I was young and runnin' wild (Runnin' wild)
Ended up in New York City (Yeah!)
Where I had my first child (That's me)
I named the boy Nasir (Yeah, Daddy!)
All the boys call him Nas (Luh ya, boy)
I told him as a youngster
He'll be the greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)
Greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!
Rest In Peace Ray Charles

The getto jam is about to slam
With some notes from the diggady d e
As I key what's really goin on
Would ya reminisce with me e

Saturday morning just gettin up
With a hangover smellin like a fuck
I really can't remember cause I'm still kinda fady
so I close my eyes and thank God that i made it
Now I'm gettin flashbacks of some O.J.
With a green glass that says Tanqueray
Took it to the hand gulped it down with the quickness
Now I need a bitch so i can handle my business
What do you know, a freak's in my reach
threw her on the flo, suckin in her deep
She's screamin and she's screamin and she's screamin
Gettin horrors, but then I busted a nut, and that was that
so kick the chorus
-Chorus-
My homies are down, chillin in the hood
Nuthin my bitches, but thet ain't no good
to another man well she might be some good cat
But the homies in the hood label her as a hood rat
She's scared to love
So those with game can fuck
And ooh, she'll pound yo ass real fast, if your quick to nut
And when your in that thi-ing
She'll make that nigga si-ng

Ain't nuthin wrong with being a Trojan man, when ya ridin
So let's kick the chorus please if ya lyin
-Chorus-
My homey's clownin in his doped yellow chevy
Too O.D.'ed to be dropped
Kenwood's kickin out the funky big trunk
Clean with the rag on top, yeah
Rollin down the store, guess what we saw, some bitches
The finest one is on my nuts, she's blowing kisses
So I approached the freak of the week
And I played it like a game of blackjack
And for all that ass that she towed in around
Well I offered a backpack
And since I'm a mack
Well you know how the story goes
So all ya hoes and their bros here we go

[Verse 1]
My, first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoos real with &amp;quot;God's Son&amp;quot; across the belly
The boss of rap, you saw me in &amp;quot;Belly&amp;quot; with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and Tupac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames should huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads apparel
But the Q.B. don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast, 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody, uh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm the N the A to the S-I-R
And If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a barber's preciseness; Bravehearted for life
It's the return of the Golden Child, son of a blue's player
So who are you playa? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that Vodka too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never, 'member I do this through righteous steps
You Judists thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me &amp;quot;God's Son&amp;quot;, with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is Nasdaq dough, in my Nascar with this Nas flow
Flip the beat back, now it's all reppin'
Hit the record sto', never let me go, get my whole collection, yo

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's, the, return of the Prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit's soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist gliss, I floss
Stick shift, look sick up in that Boxter Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go? Where he rest at?
Where he shop at and dress at?
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back-twister, lingerie-ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta wit' ya, uh

Shit, tired of getting shot at
Tired of getting chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
You na'mean?
Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga, that's why we go to Thug Mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
At Thug Mansion

Tupac:
A place to spend my quiet nights, Time to unwind,
so much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times,
I once contemplated suicide and woulda tried
But when I held that nine all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowing it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery and poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Praying hard for better days, Promised to hold on
Me and my dogs don't have a choice but to roll on
We finally found a spot to kick it
Where we could drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we could smoke in peace
And even though we Gs,
We still visualize places that we could roll a piece
And in my minds eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
Got a spot for us all, So we can ball
At Thug'z Mansion

(Chorus)
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little hennesy, laid back and cool
Every hour, cause it's all good
We've all stressed from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love
It's street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

Nas:
A place where death doesn't reside
Just thugz who collide
Not to start beef
Or spark trees
No cops rollin' by
No policemen
No homicide
No talk on the streets
No reason
For nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy
I'm tryin' to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die
I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy
Ask the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and nosy Davis grey hair maybe
Cause I feel like my eyes saw to much sufferin'
I'm just 20 some odd years I haven't lost my mother
And I cry tears of joy
I know she smiles on a boy
I dream of you more
My luck goes to Afeni Shakur
Cause like Anne Jones
She raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone
She shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together
Sipping heavenly champagne
With angels songs, with golden rings
In Thugz Mansion

Chorus

Tupac:
Dear mama don't cry, Your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and it ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night
It had me shook
Drinking peppermint schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cook
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm till the day game
Lil' Latasha sure grown, tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven
So come home
Maybe in time you'll understand, only God can save us
Where Miles Davis cutting lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past that passed on
They in heaven found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place
In Thugz Mansion

On a half shell they´re the heroes four
In this day and age who can ask for more
The crime wave is high with muggings mysterious
All police and detectives are furious
Cause they can´t find the source
Of this lethally evil force
This is serious so give me a quarter
I was a witness get me a reporter
Call April O´Neill in on this case and you better hurry up
There´s no time to waste
We need help like quick on the double
Have pity on the city, man its in trouble
We need heroes like the Lone Ranger when Tonto came pronto
When there was danger
They didn´t say We´ll be there in half an hour
Cause they displayed

Now our ace reporter was hot on the trail
Determined to put these crooks in jail
She spied the bad guys and saw what happened
But before she knew it she fell in the trap and got caught
Yeah she was all alone
With no friends and no phone
Now this was beyond her WORST dreams
Cause she was cornered by some wayward fiends
Headed by Shredder they were anything but good
Misguided, unloved, they called them the Foot
They could terrorize and be angry youth and
They loved the people who needed proof
Then from outta the dark came an awesome sound
Shouted COWABUNGA as they hit the ground
From the field the weeds the heroes rescued the flower
Cause they possessed

And find the strength to do what´s right
That´s Turtle Power

Heroes on a half shell they´re on a mission
When there´s a battle got the enemy wishin'
That they stayed at home instead of fightin'
These Ninja Masters with moves like lightnin'
They were once normal but now they´re mutants
Splinter´s the teacher so they are the students
Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Donatello
Make up the team with one other fellow
Raphael
He´s the leader of the group transformed from the norm
By the nuclear goop
Pizza´s the food that´s sure to please
These ninjas are into pepperoni and cheese
Back to the story it´s not hard to find
Ninjas not just of the body but of the mind
Those were the words that the Master instructed
But a letter from Shredder has Splinter abducted
That was the last straw spring into action
Step on the Foot now they´re gonna lose traction
Now this is for real so you fight for justice
Your shell is hard so you shout They cant dust us off
Like some old coffee table
Since you were born you been willing and able
To defeat the sneak, protect the weak
Fight for rights and your freedom to speak
Now the villain is chillin' so you make a stand
Back to the wall put your sword in your hand
Remember the words of your teacher your master
Evil moves fast but good moves faster
Than light
Shining from your illumination
Good versus Evil equals confrontation
So when you´re in trouble don´t give in and go sour
Try to rely on your

Cristal on ice I like those toes I keep from spillin it
Bone crushers I keep real close I got the skill for this
On my back the fliest clothes lookin ill as shit
Transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch
And then you die but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers had nothin to live for like them lifers but
Makin sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price the circle of success-hey turned my mic up
Im bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light your life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich your clique is rugged
Nobody would fall cause everyone would be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen I drop jewels bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life you gotta love it

Those nightmares mom
Those dreams you say you got give me the chills
But these mils make me hot y'all don't feel me
Enough to stop the illin right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feelin tight
I'm so confused
OK I'm gettin weeded now I know I'm contradicting myself
Look I don't need that now
It just once in a blue when there's nothin to do and
The tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zonin me and the chick on the l and then we're bonin

Jump up and get bucked
If you're feeling lucky duck
Then press your luck
I snatch fake gangsta MC's and make em faggot flambe
Your nine spray, my mind spray
Malignant mist steadily pumps the funk
The results you're a gang stuffed in a car trunk
You couldn't come to the jungles of the East poppin that game
You won't survive get live catchin wreck is our thing
I don't gang bang or shoot out bang bang
The relentless lyrics the only dope I slang
I'm a true master you can check my credentials
'cause I choose to use my infinite potentials
Got a freaky, freaky, freaky-freaky flow
Control the mic like fidel castro locked cuba
So deep that you can scuba dive/my jive
Origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honies all across the map
'cause I'd rather bust a nut then bust a cap in
Ya back in fact my rap snaps ya sacroilliac
I'm the mack so i don't need to tote a Mac
My attack is purely mental and its nature's not hate
It's meant to wake ya up out of ya brainwashed state
Stagnate nonsense but if you persist
You'll get ya snotbox bust you press up on this
I flip hoes dip none of the real niggas slip
You don't know enough math to count the mics that I ripped
Keep the Dirty Rotten Scoundrel as his verbal weapons spit

Real rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget
Every time i pick up the microphone i drug it
Unplug it on chumps with the gangsta babble
Leave your nines at home and bring your skills to the battle
You're rattlin' on and on and ain't sayin nothing
That's why you got snuffed when you bump heads with Dirty Rotten
Have you forgotten, i'll tap you [jaw]
I also kick like kung fu flicks by run run shaw
Made frauds bleed every time I g'd
'cause i've perfected my drunken style like sam seed
Pseudo psychos i play like Michael
Jackson when i'm bustin ass and breakin backs
Inhale the putrified aroma
Breathe too deep and you'll wind up coma-
tose the king i'm hard like a fifth of vodka
And bring your clique 'cause i'm a hard rock knocka
I gotcha, out on a limb i'm about to push you off the brink
Let you draw your craw but you burnin' shot breaks
When the East is in the house you should come equipped
Verse Three:
Fly like a jet sting like a hornet
Knuckleheads get live and set it off if you want it
Dirty rotten scoundrels is crushin fools no joke
With styles more fatal than second hand smoke
Don't provoke the wrath of this rhyme inventor

Come with the super trooper on his assault mission
The tech's technique 'cause he's a technician
Wishin he'll go away won't help the weapons stop
The skills are shot 'cause any idiot can let off a glock
Hard rock smellin the clutch of this untoucha
You claim you got beef on the streets so whatcha
Gonna do when real niggaz roll up on you
And you don't got your crew
Pull your glock but you don't got the heart
You was webbed straight from the start
Bought a tool and didn't learn how to use it
Got lost in Brooklyn so you had to lose it
Just for frontin you got that ass waxed",jeru the damaja

How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bum shit? Aight
There go the gun click, nine one one shit
All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit
Y'all niggaz remind me of a strip club, cause everytime
you come around, it's like (what) I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin to
but I'm not him, aight slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else
and we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe

That's why you layin on your back, lookin at the roof of the church

So whatever it is you puffin on that got you think that you Superman
I got the Kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggaz is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, &amp;quot;So?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go&amp;quot;

No more talkin - put him in the dirt instead
You keep walin - lest you tryin to end up red

Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin

Don't ya say shit just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
Cuz you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
Grab you gat with the extra clip
And close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it, kick it, kick it
Yea that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin
ain't no crippin
ain't no punk ass niggaz set trippin'
Everybody got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black
I wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank, and I know that I can bring ya
If ya can't take the heat get ya ass out the kitchen
We on a mission

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I'm hittin switches on the block in a 65
Come along and ride on fantastic voyage
Slide slide hoo ride, ain't no valley low enough or mountain high

I'm tryin to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside without livin in fear of a drive by
And even if I get away from them drive by killaz
I still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggaz
I keep on searchin and I keep on lookin
But niggaz are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin like they evil
You don't understand about runnin with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide, slide slippity slide
I do what I do just to survive
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide hoo ride, that's why I pack my 45

Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Every game ain't the same cause the game still remain
Don't it seem kinda strange ain't a damn thing changed
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down ass niggaz can ride with me
Hip hop hop your 45 quickly down the block
Stay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot swing low
Ain't nobody crying ain't nobody dyin
Ain't nobody worryin everybody's tryin
Nothing from nothin leaves nothin
If you wanna have somethin you better stop frontin
What you gonna do when the 5 rolls by
You better be ready so you can ride

Fools be trippin when it's time to get their freak on
Runnin round town, puttin it down with-out
no protection, for they erection
When it's time for selection what's your direction?
Before you make a choice, you betta do some inspection
If you don't know my aim and don't know my game, then
Let me explain now
Iesha slept wit Mark and Mark slept wit Tina
And Tina slept wit Javier the first time he seen her
Javier slept wit Lupe and Lupe slept with Rob
Cuz he was rollin on beads and had a good ass job
Rob slept wit Lisa who slept wit Steve and

Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade
It's too hot, *too hot*, too hot homie *too hot*
Gotta make some sense, from this mess that we made

You're doin everything momma told ya not to do
Now you're tryin to walk away cause ya know it's true
Your sister can't explain, and your brother's ashamed
to admit you both have the same last name
I don't have to ask you where you've been
Cause the matches in your purse say Holiday Inn
""A mind is a terrible thing to waste"" that was the slogan
But now it's ninety-five and it's ""Don't forget the Trojan""
Explained it to her momma, before somebody get her
Gotta hip her to the game of those smooth talkin niggaz
Love is the word, seldom meant but often heard
Latex safe sex you better learn
Or get hip to the facts before you react or
end up in a box on your back
Sometimes you ask for what you want and, get what you got
Don't get caught up in the plot, it's too damn hot

*Chorus*

Another day in the city and, oh what a pity
Even though we did our duty things are still lookin shitty
Everybody in the pack stacked, tryin to make some scratch
Walkin in the rain but they ain't got no hat
Understand how we livin in the nineties loc
Nuclear waste, cannibalism, and pistol smoke
Sex lies videotape and rape
Just a little bump n grind can seal your fate
We need to do something drastic, shit is gettin tragic
And if you don't believe me, then go ask Magic
Everybody an they momma preachin abstinence, these
kids ain't checkin for absti-shit
So put a condom in they hand and hope it don't bust
Another victim of the lust, in God we trust

Smoke the greenest grass, my bitch got the meanest ass

Lots of years in the game at your request, You like the rhyme
Bite if you dare, I get the paper so I don't care, Fly that's me

But I'd rather do Kani, Don't ask why! 5001, my son gets shit done

In our days, things changed
Everyone's ashamed to the youth cuz the truth looks strange
And for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed, and it hurts
cause any day they'll push the button
and yall condemned like Malcolm x and Bobby Hunton, died for nothin
Don't them let me get teary, the world looks dreary
but when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
there's no need for you to fear me

And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy

I don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I keep discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottle
I make mistakes, but learn from every one
And when its said and done
I bet this Brotha be a better one
If I'm upset, you don't stress
Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the lord do his thang
But am I less holy
Cuz I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace in that war on the streets

Say peace and give a pound have a drink, get down
I'm on the floor, besides the door
The sound is rich, and I ain't poor
I'm looking for Susie or Wendy or Judy
But look at her [repeat 3X] ""Who me?""
Yes, you sweetie, although it's hard to see thee
I see your silhouette and what I see has got me needy
I need you for a second of your time
But then I reckon that a second is too short let me try
""You're slammin!""

And our echo starts to fade
No you will not be alone then
And you will not be afraid

When the fog has finally lifted
From my cold and tired brow
No I will not leave you crying
And I will not let you down
No I will not let you down

Now comes the night
Feel it fading away
And the soul underneath
Is it all that remains
So just slide over here
Leave your fear in the fray
Let us hold to each other
Until the end of our days

He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'

He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out

Stay in one spot, another day of monotony

Success is my only mothafuckin' option, failure's not

Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
One less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers
Give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
Unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of 2 distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and that's the way it is

It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other

We ain't ready, to see a black President dead, uhh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks

That's the sound of my tool you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool

And I never get to lay back

One time.. yeah.. yeah..

Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with
151, one sip’ll make a nigga flip
Writin names on my hollow tips, plottin shit
Mad violence who I’m gon’ body, this hood politics
Ackowledge it, leave bodies chopped in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us {*siren*} roll up and try knockin us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his heineken
Richochetin between the spots that I’m hidin in
Blackin out as I shoot back, fuck gettin hit! [more sirens]
This is my hood i’ma rep, to the death of it
’til everybody come home, little niggaz is grown
Hoodrats, don’t abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon
Sip from the star sun and the moon
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die, with nines out
This is what nas is bout, nigga the time is now!

[whispering again]
Yo, all I need is one mic..
All I need is one mic.. that’s all I need
All I need is one mic.. all I need niggaz
All I need is one mic.. yeah

[gradually getting louder]
All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen
One prayer - tell God forgive for one sin
Matter fact maybe more than one, look back
At all the hatred against me, fuck alla them
Jesus died at age 33, there’s thirty-three shots
From twin glocks there’s sixteen apiece, that’s thirty-two
Which means, one of my guns was holdin 17
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin is fair, niggaz roll up, shootin from wheelchairs
My heart is racin, tastin revenge in the air
I let the shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I’m strapped with a couple of macs, too many nines
If y’all niggaz really wit me get busy load up the semis
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
There’s nothin in our way - they bust, we bust, they rust, we rust
Led flyin, feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie ’em down
Cause we stronger now my nigga the time is now!!

[whispering again]
All I need is one mic.. that’s all I need, that’s all I need
All I need is one mic.. there’s nuttin else in the world
All I need is one mic.. that’s all a nigga need to do his thing y’know
All I need is one mic..

[starting loud this time, getting quieter]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath I’m one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don’t understand
Or wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin all that slick shit, the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggaz’ll move on you
Only if they know, what your weakness is I have none
Too late to grab guns I’m blastin cause I’m a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn’t have that ass done? fooled you niggaz
What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin each other
Up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my range, niggaz throwin dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn’t true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin, I never make the same mistakes
Movin with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin my melon cause none of these niggaz real
Heard he was, tellin police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I’m on the right track I’m finally found
You need some soul searchin, the time is now

All I need is one mic.. yeah, yeah yeah yeah
All I need is one mic.. that’s all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash
All I need is one mic.. fuck the cars, the jewelry
All I need is one mic.. to spread my voice to the whole world",nas

16252,16253,Arrested Development,Tennessee,Tennessee,Arrested Development,"Lord I've really been real stressed
Down and out, losing ground
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messing up
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire (home)
But Lord I ask you (home)
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan
(repeat)

Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talkin' to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyesburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)
Go back to from whence you came (home)
My family tree, my family name (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Eshe? She went down to Holly Springs.
Rasha Don and Baba? They went down to Peachtree.
Headliner, I challenge you to a game of horseshoes.
A game of horseshoes!

Now I see the importance of history
Why people in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
My brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said 'cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And you was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty...
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for
Are the answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee

Take me to another place (Home)
Take me to another land (Home)
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

Oh won't you let me
Won't you help me
Won't you help me understand you plan?
Take me home
Take me home
Home
Take me to another place
Take me home
Oh you know I need to go home, yeah

[Nas]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein born
Same time a man is murdered, the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up, and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane?
That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape cd covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin large, takin it light
Pushin big toys, gettin nice, enjoyin your life
is what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and hell, rap legend, president felt
And of course N - A - S are the letters that spell . . .

""Nas is like.."" Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death
The last one left, let my cash invest in stock
Came a along way from blastin, techs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, ownin acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes, givin fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my nine spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth, can't take it when you under this Earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Makin choices, that determine my future under the sky
To rob steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much to success to ya, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is

Chorus

""Nas is like.."" Sex to a nympho, but nothin sweet
I'm like beef, bustin heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, greenleaf reaper
Like Greeks in Egypt, learnin somethin deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your nine, your man you would die for
Always got you, I'm like Pop Duke you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races

Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of em fam'

Well umm, boom, shak-a-lak, I got the flavors, the funk
Whew! And it's smellin up the hip-hop
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
Mixed a, little of this, and now I gotta rap
I'm the, Chief Rocka, so I guess I am in charge
I freak it with a twist so you'll boom it in your cars
I'm the, one with the flow and the grip like G.I. Joe
I snatch, I grab, and then I grab the dough, see if
I was an Indian I'd still be the Chief
The only other difference I'd smoke weed in a leaf
To the hip, the hop, to the hibby to the hibbidy
hip-hop, oh no, I don't wanna go pop!
I got, too much soul, rhythm and blues
R&amp;B ya see, all that's cool, but
hip-hop and rap yeah that's where my heart's at
Even back when I used to break on a box
Backspins for backspin, even while I'm rappin
Before I had a record, I always kept em clappin
Freestylin on the block, now I Chief Rock
I always entertain, by diggin in my crux
My brain, so if it's gonna rain let it rain
I spook you with the hit, make you jump like House of Pain
Boogaloo boogaloo, shake and jump
And remember, remember, Chief Rocka won't front

*Lord Jazz cuts 'The Lord Chief Rocka, number one Chief Rocka' 4X*

Verse Three: DoItAll, Mr. Funke

[DIA] Ay Mr. Funke
[MrF] Whassup?
[DIA] Can I get assistance?
[MrF] For what?
[DIA] For what? Yo Jazz, flex a cut
Well back is the backer, I'm chillin with my knocker
And if ya got beef, then you can live with Jimmy Hoffa like
[duo] what goes up, must come down
[DIA] But not me clown
I cut em, crack a speaker when I'm pumpin
So jump in, and watch your earrrs start hummin
through the block, and don't forget to boom shak shak-a-lak
[MrF] Well damn DoItAll can I rock?
I hear a beat I grab the mic, and then I start this workin
The kids around the way used to think that I was buggin
But they don't understand how I feel about the funk
I walk with the funk, I talk with the funk
I eat with the funk, I sleep with the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
So now what do they say, when I'm walkin up the block?
Boom shaka laka there goes the Chief Rocka

Mike Jones!!
Befo' I came up in the game these hoes didn't show no love
They see me in the club and used to treat me like a scrub
They wouldn't holla cause my dollars wasn't swoll enough
I bet they change they mind when them 80 4's come rollin up
They see that I'm a star, now they wanna sit in my car
Now they wanna count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my bar now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me now
They tellin all they friends when I leave how they miss me now
2 8 1, 3 3 0, eight zero zero fo'
Hit Mike Jones up on the low cause Mike Jones about to blow
Befo' the ice was in my grill, befo' I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was heah, geah
Befo' the ice was in my grill, befo' I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was heah, geah
Befo' the ice was in my grill, befo' I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was heah, geah - because

I remember back den, most of them hoes couldn't stand me
But now them same hoes beggin me to pull down they panties
A couple of 'em said I was cute but I was just too chubby
Same size a year later the same hoes wanna fuck me
Because they see me paid, pimpin pens, workin my jelly
And I ain't trippin cause my pockets stick out mo' than my belly
They know I'm paid, livin laid in the shade
2 slabs in the Escalade with fo' or five estates
Then know that I got it made, I'm a motherfuckin baller
She would want a nigga now but I ain't got no time to call her
I'ma stall her like she stalled me, now she tryin to call me
Bitch I'ma dog yo' ho ass like you dogged me
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know the name
Ain't nuttin changed but my change, I'ma stay the same
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know the name
Ain't nuttin changed but my change, I'ma stay the same

These hoes that's poppin on me now didn't even know my name
They said my flow was lame, they said I had no game
I told 'em all I was fin' to blow they thought I was insane
But then my name start blowin up quick, now they jumpin on my dick
Cause they see me on the rise and oh now my paper thick
But then my name started blowin up quick, now they jumpin on my dick

16506,16507,T.I.,No Matter What,No Matter What,T.I.,"I say, still I stand
Hey shorty here I am

Never have ya seen in ya lifetime
A more divine Southern rapper with a swagga like mine
Facin' all kind of time, but smile like I'm fine
Brag with such passion and shine without tryin'
Believe me, pain's a small thing to a giant
I was born without a dime, out the gutter I climbed
Spoke my mind and didn't stutter one time
Ali say even the greatest gotta suffer sometime
So I huff and puff rhymes, lyrics so sick wit' it
Set the standard in Atlanta, how to get get get it
So you up-and-coming rappers wanna diss, just kill it
I'm officially the realest, point blank, period
Whether I still live in the hood or just visit
Whatever you can do in the hood, I done did it
That why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
This still the city long as Tip livin,' nigga

I ain't dead (Nah), I ain't done (Nah)
I ain't scared (Of what?), I ain't run (From who?)
But still I stand (Yeah)
No matter what, people, here I am (Yeah)
No matter what, remember
I ain't break (Never), I ain't fold (Never)
They hate me more (So?), and yeah, I know (Ha ha)
But here I go (Yeah)
No matter what, shorty, here I go (Ha)
No matter what, shorty

You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
I'm sure to be in jail till 2027
Rather see me in the cell than instead of this new McLaren
God will take you to hell just to get you to heaven
So even though it's heavy, the load I will carry
Grin is still bear it, win and still share it
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Life can change your directions, even when ye ain't planned it
All you can do it handle it, worst thing you can do is panic
Use it to your advantage, avoid insanity, manage
To conquer every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning's illogical, losing's still far from optional
Ay, yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But when life throw punches, block and counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside ''mi casa'' too long, I did a song
To make it known that the King lives on, pimpin'

I ain't dead (Nah), I ain't done (Nah)
I ain't scared (Of what?), I ain't run (From who?)
But still I stand (Yeah)
No matter what, people, here I am (Yeah)
No matter what, remember
I ain't break (Never), I ain't fold (Never)
They hate me more (So?), and yeah, I know (Ha ha)
But here I go (Yeah)
No matter what, shorty, here I go (Ha)
No matter what, shorty

Even in solitude, there's still no hotter dude
I show you how to do what you do, ya ain't got a clue
All you do is follow dudes, sound like a lotta dudes
I'll weather whatever storm, make it out without a bruise
I understand why, now when my hands tied
They take shots 'cause if I'm out there, it's a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served, nigga, no shit
Guess it was understood, for me it was over with
But I don't quit, if ye ain't noticed yet
They couldn't wait to say goodnight, shorty
So they can try to rhyme, act and look like shorty
Go get a beat from Toomp and make a hook like shorty
'Fore you know it I'm back, what it look like, shorty?
I lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here
Yeah, and I hope the picture painted clear
If your heart filled with faith then you can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin'?
Easy, let go and let God deal with it

I ain't dead (Nah), I ain't done (Nah)
I ain't scared (Of what?), I ain't run (From who?)
But still I stand (Yeah)
No matter what, people, here I am (Yeah)
No matter what, remember
I ain't break (Never), I ain't fold (Never)
They hate me more (So?), and yeah, I know (Ha ha)
But here I go (Yeah)

This without a reason
Another promise fallen through
Another season passes by you

I never took the smile away
From anybody's face
And that's a desperate way to look
For someone who is still a child

In a big country
Dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice
Fires the mountainside
Stay alive

I thought that pain and truth
Were things that really mattered
But you can't stay here with
Every single hope you had shattered

I'm not expecting to grow
Flowers in the desert
But I can live and breathe
And see the sun in wintertime

In a big country
Dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice
Fires the mountainside
Stay alive

In a big country
Dreams stay with you
Like a lover's voice
Fires the mountainside
Stay alive

So take that look out of here
It doesn't fit you
Because it's happened doesn't mean
You've been discarded

Were things that really mattered

they try to follow but they're shallow and hollow
I can see right through them like an empty 40 bottle, of O.E.
they have no key, or no clue
to the game at all, now they washed up
hung out to dry
standing looking stpud, wondering why

(Twista talking)
Man, I know we had a lot of tragedies lately.
I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah,
Rest in peace to Left Eye,
Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay,
And everybody lost in the Twin Towers,
And everybody lost period.
All we got is HOPE!!

VERSE 1 (Twista)
I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks,
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, And I
Wish my brother woulda made bail,
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, And I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick,
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, And I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer,
When the streets get the upper had on us and we lose a brother, And I
Wish I could go deep in a zone,
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, And I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a could teach a soul to fly,
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them hi, And I
Wish God never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, And I (I wish)
Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous,
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, But uh
We will never break, though they devistate, we shall motivate,
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith.
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day,
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today.
Sit at the light so long,
And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong,
So when right go wrong,
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on!!!
Let's HOPE!

CHORUS (Cee-Lo)
Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.
Let's be hopeful!

VERSE 2 (Twista)
I wish that you could show some love,
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people commin up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing,
Watch the music and have 'em trippin of the joy I bring, (shiit)
I wish that we could hold hands,
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man, And I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders,
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me) (I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat,
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stain� strong,
You can make it whether you wit him or your mans gone, And I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary,
And the po po bring the heat on them priest like they did R. Kelly, And I
Wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (shit) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again,
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN,
I wish that enemies could talk,
And that super homie Christopher Reeves could still walk, (I wish)
I wish that we could walk a path, stay doin the right thing
Hustle hard so the kids maintain up in the game,
Let's HOPE

CHORUS (Cee-Lo)
Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.
Let's be hopeful!

VERSE 3 (Twista)
Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic,
I try to spread my message to the world the best way I can give it,
We can make it always so optimistic,
If you don't listen gotta live my life the best way I can live it,
I pray for justice when we go to court,
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war,
Why can't we kick it and just get em on,
And in the famous words of Mr. King �Why can't we all just get along�,
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze,
And ask way are we fulfillin these downfalls and prophecies,
You can be wrong if it's you doubting,
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains,
And only the heavenly father and ease the hurt,
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church!!
And let's HOPE

CHORUS (Cee-Lo) X 2
Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away,
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay.
Let's be hopeful!

Baby pull your pants up,
I like it when i see you do it,
Better then i ever seen it done before,
A lot of women drop it to the ground,
But how low can you go?
Lower then your mama’s ever seen it in her life time,
Never would’ve imagined did not even in her right mind,
Practice in front of that mirror,
Now you doing it on the dance floor,
Mad cause i can’t get wit ya ya just show me how to dance (OH!)
I may not wanna get low so i post it up kinda like a playa do,
But if you come to the crib,
Then i might show you girls a thang or 2,

From A-T-L-A-N-T-A and all the way down to your drop,
Put the needle on a record and i make her get lower than a Lamborghini,
And if she really gettin low then imma shoot a video and put it all on TV,
Cos i like that French vanilla and the caramel,

But when it comes to chocolate,
I know that very well,
Asian persuasion,
no discrimination,
I love how they seen to please us,

Chorus: Nas (set to Eurythmics ""Sweet Dreams"")

Street dreams are made of these
Niggaz push Beemers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin a key
Everybody's lookin for somethin..
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggaz with big G's
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's lookin for somethin..

[Nas]
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear
Nothin on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
with the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty
I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty
For real G, I'ma fullfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
the first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million
without the FBI catchin feelings

Chorus

[Nas]
From fat cat to papi, niggaz see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holdin gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Livin with moms, gettin it on, flushin crack down the toilet
Two sips from bein alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from bein rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smokin on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back livin sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hoppin in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

Chorus

Growin up project-struck, lookin for luck dreamin
Scopin the large niggaz beamin, check what I'm seein
Cars, ghetto stars pushin ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early 80's, throwin rocks at the crazy lady
Worshippin every word them rope rockin niggaz gave me
The street raised me up, givin a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was livin it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty
Ain't that funny? Gettin put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, paintin the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggaz went for theirs, flippin coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressin, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spendin never holdin out

Flow with the beat real smooth and nicely
Ladies, I wanna' rock with you
And Later in the night, you know I'd like to persue
Somthing, real sexy and nice

Play that funky music Vanilla Ice!

Play that funky music riiight-I can't hear you!
Lay down the boogie and play that funky music 'till you die

Some people thought I wouldn't break
Then I stuffed number one in their face
Never, forget where I came from
Don't lose your head, heh, 'cause you can get dumb
Do it, is my motto for the moment
Get in my way, I'll knock you out like my opponent
Cause' in this life it's one for all
All for one and a loud no downfall
Punks, always wanna' get some
Pick-Pockets and then they try to play dumb
Yo', take it From the Ice man

A white rapper with some street knowledge
I write the rhyme for you, Yeeeah
Drop this one for the V.I.P. Crew

CHORUS

Vanilla Ice, Yep Yep, I come in hard like a rhino
Intoxicate you so you staggle like whino
So stop trying, Girl stop crying
Vanilla Ice is selling and you people are buying
It's not me, it's my possie, Too
That's why you freaks are talking like Crazy Glue
Movin', and Groovin' trying to sing along
All through Ghetto to prove this here song
Now your amazed, by the V.I.P possie
Stepin' so hard like a German Nazi
Startled by the vases hittin' the ground
There no trip in the mind because im gettin' down

You taught me words, and I thought you might have it
So sit down and lend me your ear
'Cause 1990 is my year, baby

Your body's gettin' hot, SO?, so I can smell it
So don't be mad, and don't be sad

You can call me Dad
Your pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure
Witch doctor Ice(SSS) will do the dance to cure
Come up close, uh, and don't be square
You wanna' battle me? Anytime, Anywhere

Boy, your dead wrong
Come on everybody, let's sing this song
Say, Play that funky music

Its been a long time
been a long time comin'
Its life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turning back now.
This is what makes me.
This is what I am.

Hear me, lets go

Chorus: Puffy

You can hate me now (QB)
But I won't stop now (Real Niggas)
Cause I can't stop now (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now You gonna hate me I'ma hate you too
Cause I can't stop now Simple as that
You can hate me now Die motherfucker die motherfucker die
You can hate me nooow You don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck
about anything thats about to go down
Do it now, Do It now, weak, jealous motherfuckers,
do it now Fuck y'all

Verse 1:

Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I dry
Close your eyes, picture me rollin,
sixes, money foldin
Bitches honeys that swollen
the riches, nas get in ya
most critically acclaimed pulitzer prize winner
best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater
model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
commentators bring aside try watchin my paper
almost a decade quite impressive
most of the best N' the sss's
for this rap shit that I stand for
expanding more to the big screen
bill gates dreams
but it seems youd rather see me in jail
with state dreams
want me off the scene fast
but good things last
like your favorite m.c. still makin' some mean cash
first rapper to bring a platinum plaque
back to the projects
but you still wanna hate, be my guest
I suggest

money is power motherfucker
I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch

Do it now
Chorus I won't stop
can't stop
you gon'hate me
I hate you too
you can hate me now
you can hate me now

Do it now, I told you do it now lets go

Verse 2:

You wanna hate me then hate me
what can I do?
but keep gettin money
funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard never give up
until I made it
now y'all sayin that's a clever nigga
nothing to play with
hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol G
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
took my niggas out the hood but you doubt on us
sayin' we left the hood
but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes
give 'em to you?
here's my car and my house
you can live in that too
criticize when I flow for the streets
hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that
what you expect hoe
nickname esco
took this game to its threshold
best flow I bet the whole U.S. know
try to make it like you the realest
but who the illest?
think we all know the answer to that
cause niggas feel this right

you think I'm gonna come this far and let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too

Do it now

Chorus

I like this, I like the way this feels

Verse 3:

Its a thin line between paper and hate
friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates
I was destined to come
predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
took a little time to claim my spot
jammin up the border to this game stop
and I side with the Lord
ride for the cause
while driving, niggas shot out my doors
plottin, I'm sure to catch me
with they glocks to my jaw
try stickin me up but I
but I flipped on these ducks You tried
Instead of me
ambulances were picking them up That's what you get
niggas fear what they don't understand
hate what they can't conquer
guess its just inferior man
became a monster, atop of the world
never fallin
I'm as real as they come
from day one, forever ballin
c'mon

hey y'all can't see a nigga like me, never in your life
and that's what you can't understand

Chorus (x2)
(Do it now, do it now)
(do it now, do it now)

But then again I got a story

Where I'm from, not dum diddie dum
From the base motherland
The place of the drum
Invaded by the wack diddie wack
Fooled the black, left us faded
King and chief probably had a big beef
Because of dat now I grit my teeth
So here's a song to the strong
'Bout a shake of a snake

'Cause the wickedness done by Jack
Where everybody at
Divided and sold

Smacked in the back
For the other man to mack

Dockin' this boat
No hope I'm shackled
Plus gang tackled
By the other hand swingin' the rope
Wearin' red, white and blue Jack and his crew
The guy's authorized beat down for the brown
Man to the man, each one so it teach one
Born to terrorize sisters and every brother
One love who said it
I know Whodini sang it
But the hater taught hate
That's why we gang bang it
Beware of the hand
When it's comin' from the left
I ain't trippin' just watch ya step
Can't truss it
An I judge everyone, one by the one
Look here come the judge
Watch it here he come now
I can only guess what's happ'nin'
Years ago he woulda been
The ships captain
Gettin' me bruised on a cruise
What I got to lose, lost all contact
Got me layin' on my back
Rollin' in my own leftover
When I roll over, I roll over in somebody else's
90 F--kin' days on a slave ship
Count 'em fallin' off 2, 3, 4 hun'ed at a time
Blood in the wood and it's mine
I'm chokin' on spit feelin' pain
Like my brain bein' chained
Still gotta give it what I got
But it's hot in the day, cold in the night
But I thrive to survive, I pray to god to stay alive
Attitude boils up inside
And that ain't it (think I'll every quit)
Still I pray to get my hands 'round
The neck of the man wit' the whip
3 months pass, they brand a label on my ass
To signify
Owned
I'm on the microphone
Sayin' 1555

Livin' ain't the word

I must admit on some occasions I went out like a punk and a chump
Or a sucka or something to that effect
Respect I used to never get, when all I got was upset
When niggas use to be like 'What's up fool!?'
and tried to sweat a nigga like the Lip
For no reason at all I can recall crip niggas throwin' C in my face
Down the hall I'm kickin' it in the back of the school eatin' chicken at three
Wonderin' 'Why is everybody always pickin' on me?'
I tried to talk and tell them, 'Chill' I did nothing to deserve this
But when it didn't work I wasn't scared just real nervous
and unprepared to deal with scrappin' no doubt
My pappy never told me how to knock a nigga out
But now in '95 I must survive as a man on my own
Fuck around with Fatlip yes ya get blown
I'm not tryin to show no macho is shown

There comes a time in every mans life when he's gotta handle shit up on his own
Can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
please they got problems of they own
Down for the count on seven chickens shits don't get to Heaven
til they faced these fears in these fear zones
Used to get jacked back in high school I played it cool
just so some real shit won't get full blown
Being where I'm from they let the smoke come quicker
than an evil redneck could lynch a helpless colored figure
And as a victim I invented low-key
til the keyhole itself got lower than me
So I stood up and let my free form form free
Said 'I'm gonna get some before they knockin' out me'
I don't sweat it I let the bullshit blow in the breeze
in other words just freeze!

[Fish Scales]
My first song was like forty-eight boys with no moves
You hear me flippin thru my pages out my favorite notebook
The microphone was in the closet (What?) No headphones, we lost it
Niggas scared to get some water, roaches hangin over the faucets
No AC, Tez'll break a sweat just tryin to make beats
E-Dubz was being a hustler, (Heeeyy man!)
all play flirtin all his customers, and flat broke
Nappy smokin blacks out on the back po'ch
I'm thinkin I got everything a country boy can ask for

[Big V]
Now what we do to get here? (Say dat boy!!)
Lay it down and bring it to ya raw (Say dat boy!!)
Hey now we hurt some, suffered for more, takes what we work for
Hated for for the cussin, but the hatred it made us cuss more
Held on, but it was hard - stepped up, took charge
Ran thru what we scared up, but what was we afraid for?
Look what we made of, heart that what made us
Being here is alright, but MUST believe we won't fall!

Them country boys on the rise!
With them big fat wheels on the side!

And aw-awww-awww-awwwww!

Kentucky mud, them kinfolk, twankies with them hundred-spokes
Skullied on that front po'ch, plus you know they got 'dro
Seventy-nine coupe DeVille vertical Caddy grill
Interstate 65 headin down to Cashville
Glass filled, to the tippy-top, back-seat Benz
Spent my last cent on the rent, left with pocket lints
A damn shame, gotta grind anythang and everythang
Jimmy Crack Corn, cross the county line with Mary Jane
A long time, a gravel road, to cash and fame and sold my soul
To Hell and back, and back and forth, with same jeans and nappy 'fro

Not parties with shorties, wallin like they swallowin Bacardi

He want a wife, he just lookin' for the right type&amp;quot;
Yea right, I be ridin' through the city lights
My hat bent, gettin' high behind the 'lac tint
I'm chilllin' with Brazilian women, heavy accents
They black friends translatin', got'em all ass naked, adjacent
Have relations wit'em many places
Leavin' semen in they Pretty faces
Make'em kiss they partners with it in they faces
Young pimpin' sprung women 'cross the 50 states
Got young ladies requestin' &amp;quot;What's Yo Name&amp;quot; on 50 stations
Askin' me what's a pussy popper, want a demonstration
But I ain't waitin' til the second date, I'm so impatient
Relieve'em of they aggravation, take'em rollerskatin'
On them Dayton's, tell'em &amp;quot;Baby, stick with me, you goin' places&amp;quot;
Go replace'em, draw erase'em out my memory
Moist panties and wet sheets when they think of me

All the classy ones like to act like they a virgin
And the nasty ones like when I talk to'em dirty
But I'm breakin' the ice, got'em laughin' and flirtin'
They be, removin' they skirts when they hop in the 'burban
Once the flick start playin' and the &amp;quot;E&amp;quot; start kickin' in
Her girlfriend lickin' and she beggin' me to stick it in
That's why, I like chillin' with women who like women
Lightskinned... Asians, Jamaicans and white women
Indians, Italians, Haitians and Puerto Ricans
They be itchin' for they chance and waitin' in me to freak'em

Ain't got that kinda time cuz this the only day I'm in town
So come and, chill in the cut if you willin' to cut
And when you, give me a hug I be feelin' yo butt
Now so while for while we talkin', I'm fillin' yo cup
We killin' the bottle, wake up in dirty linen tomorrow
But tell me would it trouble you if we ended up at the W-
Sippin' on a malibu pine apple juice and a blunt or two
Now whachu wanna do? Opportunity's right in front of you
Know you used to meetin' dudes, dodgin'em for a month or two
But young pimpin' spit linen to the young women

(But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales
that you was, throwin rocks, at the Roof at 12, nigga?)
This is the truth I shell, till the loot gets frail
I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale
Me and you ballin, from the heavens, or the hell
Won't let you hit the ground if I'm fallin myself
Now picture me leavin you in this cold world, rollin for delf
It's me and you in this old girl, we takin the belt
From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine
Just continue to be my Sunshine (uhhh)

Puttin oil on her likes like she Gloria Velez

Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she {""wouldn't get far""} cause five hundred dollars
can't get you that {""far""} how you get that {""far""}

Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team
Head so good he don't ask for a pre.. nup

Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo
