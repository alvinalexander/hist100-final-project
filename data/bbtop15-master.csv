[Intro]
Bust it

[Verse 1]
This here's a jam for all the fellas
Tryin' to do what those ladies tell us
Get shot down cause ya overzealous
Play hard to get females get jealous
Okay smarty, go to a party
Girls are scantily clad and showin' body
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her
But you're standing on the wall like you was Poindexter
Next day's function, high class luncheon
Food is served and you're stone-cold munchin'
Music comes on people start to dance
But then you ate so much you nearly split your pants
A girl starts walking, guys start gawking
Sits down next to you and starts talking
Says she wants to dance cause she likes to groove
So come on fatso and just bust a move

Just bust a move

[Verse 2]
You're on a mission and your wishin'
Someone could cure your lonely condition
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places
No fine girls just ugly faces
From frustration, first inclination
Is to become a monk and leave the situation
But every dark tunnel has a light of hope
So don't hang yourself, with a celibate rope
New movie's showin', so you're goin'
Could care less about the five you're blowin'
Theater gets dark just to start the show
Then ya spot a fine woman sittin' in your row
She's dressed in yellow, she says ""Hello
Come sit next to me you fine fellow""
You run over there without a second to lose
And what comes next? Hey, bust a move

[Hook]
You want it, you got it
You want it, baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it, you got it
You want it, baby you got it
Yeah

[Verse 3]
In the city, ladies look pretty
Guys tell jokes so they can seem witty
Tell a funny joke just to get some play
Then you try to make a move and she says, ""No way""
Girls are fakin', goodness sakin'
They want a man who brings home the bacon
Got no money and you got no car
Then you got no woman and there you are
Some girls are sadistic, materialistic
Lookin' for a man makes them opportunistic
They're lyin' on the beach perpetrating a tan
So that a brother with money can be their man
So on the beach you're strollin', real high rollin'
Everything you have is yours and not stolen
A girl runs up with somethin' to prove
So don't just stand there, bust a move

[Hook]
You want it, you got it
You want it, baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it, you got it
You want it, baby you got it
Yeah

[Interlude]
Break it down for me fellas

[Verse 4]
Your best friend Harry, has a brother Larry
In five days from now he's gonna marry
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can
Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man
You say, ""neat-o"", check your libido
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo
The bride walks down just to start the wedding
And there's one more girl you won't be getting
So you start thinkin' then you start blinking
A bridesmaid looks and thinks that you're winking
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back
And now your feelin' really firm cause the girl is stacked
Reception's jumpin' faces pumpin'
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'
Says she wanna dance to a different groove
Now you know what to do, so you bust a move

[Hook]
You want it, you got it
You want it, baby you got it (Just bust a move)
You want it, you got it
You want it, baby you got it (move it boy)
Yeah

2,2,Big Daddy Kane,Smooth Operator,3,1989-11-04,"

[Verse 1]
Well excuse me, take a few minutes, to mellow out
Big Daddy Kane is on the mic and I'mma tell about
A minimum length, of rhymes of strength
And power, so listen to the man of the hour
Flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
Sing ho, swing low, then yo the show
Will go on, as I perform
Transformin on stage like a Decepticon
But I'm not animated like a cartoon
I'm for real, shootin lyrics like a harpoon
Across the crowd, the listeners, the spectators
So let's groove with the smooth operator

[Hook]
""Cause I'm so smooth...""

The B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y-K-A-N-E
I'm good and plenty, servin many and any
Competition, wishin' for an expedition
I'm straight up dissin' and dismissin', listen
Rappers act so wild, and love to profile
Frontin hard but ain't got no style
I give nightmares to those who compete
Freddy Kreuger, walkin' on Kane Street
Confuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews
Who choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues
Destruction from the exterminator
But in a calm manner, cause I'm a smooth operator

[Hook]
""Cause I'm so smooth...""

[Verse 2]
Now girls step up to this
One simple kiss, and it's over, Miss
Sold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem
Girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
So just swing or fling a gathering, try to cling
Cause It's a Big Daddy Thing
And I'm lovin em right, word is bond
So just play Marvin Gaye and Let's Get It On
I make it real good like Dr. Feelgood
To make sure that my point is understood
That when it comes to this there's none greater
Sincerely yours... the smooth operator

[Hook]
""Cause I'm so smooth...""

[Verse 3]
Now ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black
Sayin' I'm a new jack, you need to be smacked
The smooth way I say 'em and the way I display 'em
To make them sound different in a way that's gifted
And hey I'm, makin sure every lyric is done fine
And I make one line, bright as the sunshine
Attack you like Robitussin on a cough
If you know like I know -- step off
Competition, I'mma get rid of
You can't get a bit of, so just consider
A break or rest, vacation, hibernation
And make way for my smooth operation
I'm a smooth operator

[Hook]
""Cause I'm so smooth...""

Ahhhhh yeahhh, and you don't stop
Genuine for '89
And I still ain't half-steppin, peace!

"
3,3,MC Lyte,Cha Cha Cha,4,1989-11-04,"

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

You can cha-cha-cha to this Mardis Gras
I'm the dopest female that you've heard thus far
And I do get better, the voice gets wetter
Nobody gets hurt (as long as you let her)
Do my thing with an '89 swing
The dopeness I write, I guarantee delight
To the hip-hop maniac, the Uptown brainiac
In full effect, MC Lyte is back
And better than before as if that was possible
My competition, you'll find them in the hospital
Visiting time, I think it's on a Sunday
But notice they only get one day to shine
The rest of the week is mine
And I'll blind you with the science that the others have yet to find
So come along and I'll lead you the right way
Just clap your hands to the words I say, come on...

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

I've got the power to spread out and devour
At the same time I'll eat you up with a rhyme
But I'll let you slide cuz you accidently hopped on the wrong side
Now come on, that's suicide
Hypothetically speaking
Ok, let's say you didn't know what you were doing
You're new in town, and you're looking around
For another name to ruin, and it's me that you're pursuing?
Well well well, I'll be damned
I might as well tell you who I am
I am the capital L-Y-T-E
And it's shocking I'm the one you're mocking
Oh yes, I've been watching you watching me
And like the fat on your back it's plain to see
That you're a wannabe, but you can't be what you're not
So you better start living with what you got

[Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

Yeah, DJ K-Rock when you hear a scratch
Now it's time to kick a rhyme out the batch
And you're the receiver eager as a beaver
Time to convert the non-believer
That I'm a roadrunner leaving you in the dust
I can adjust to the times and at times I might just get quicker
Than the ticker of your pacemaker
More tender than a roni but harder than a jawbreaker
So don't ever second guess me
And if you're wondering who could the best be
Think a second and recollect the worst whipping you ever had yet
And I'll bet that I did it
My fingerprints are still on you
How many times I gotta warn you
About the light? It'll blind your sight
But the rhythm will still guide you through the night

[Kick this tip...
Kick this one here for me and my DJ]

4,4,Kool Moe Dee,I Go To Work,5,1989-11-04,"

[Verse 1]
I go to work like a doctor
When I rock the mic, you got to like
The way I operate
I make miracles happen just from rappin'
I'm so lyrically potent and I'm flowin'
And explodin'
On the scene mean
I got the potential
To make you go then chill
I got the credentials that are so essential
To make a rhyme send chills
Then you know I will fulfill
To make a couple of mill
As I build a guild for all the rappers with skill
And kill the weak rappers with no thrills
Hang 'em in effigy
If he's a sucker, hang 'em to the left of me
Cause my right hand man is my mic stand and
The microphone that I own and my game plan
Is keeping at a steady pace
Ain't no reason to rush, it ain't no race
I'ma hit the top just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time and I'm gonna
Cause I know when to go 'head into
The classic Moe Dee rap That sent ya
Runnin' around, holdin' ya head
Asking your homeboy ""Yo man, you hear what he said?""
Another funky rhythm
Look at your man and give him a high five
Cause I'm live
Runnin' around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it
I go to work

[Hook]
I go to work
I go to work

[Verse 2]
I go to work like an architect
I build a rhyme sometimes it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word
With each letter, it becomes visibly better
Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vacation, I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone, Daddy's home
Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the suckers in the place who run their face
A taste of the bass and who's the ace
Start the race, I'm coming in first
With each verse I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I have ya, I have to slap ya
Senseless with  endless rhymes don't pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done
Your mind will become
So trapped in the rap you'll lust another one
But you gotta wait; it takes time
I don't write, I build a rhyme
Draw the plans, draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one
I go to work

[Hook]
I go to work
I go to work

[Verse 3]
I go to work, like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to outfox ya
Like a punch my rhyme rocks ya
Some times it knocks ya  so hard it stops ya
Dead in your tracks, so power packed
Before you can react, you're flat on your back
Down for the count, get up and dismount
'Cause I'm coming with an endless amount
Of rhymes in a hurry like a flurry
A collage to camouflage the power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote, I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight I wrote
Rhymes at a level, so you can't relate
Unless you're intelligent, so stay awake
Sleepwalkers, slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil
Writing my rhymes in its highest form
I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up
A few casualties but so what
If you're slow, you blow
You know you go, I flow
I throw all pro, I go to work

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
To say rap is not work is ludicrous
Whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me, you'll compare me
To a prophet for profit, not merely
Putting words together for recreation
Each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation?
I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work

[Hook]

5,5,Wreckx-N-Effect,New Jack Swing,6,1989-11-04,"

Yo Wreckx-N-Effect
In full effect!
(""Word up!"")
(""Know we need it. Know we need it."")
(""Give it to me. Give it, give it"")

[Verse 1: Aqil]
It's the New Jack Swing
Yes, it's something funky that you can cling
All you gotta do is c'mon and sing
Word for word, every lyric that I bring
And if you surely swing your body
When you step in cool inside a party
Watching all the girls just pumping like hotties
They have parts that look better than Ferraris
So I had to try these
Dancing, with this girl, on my luck
I was chancing, hoping she was the type for romancing
But my rap needed a little enhancing
Because this girlie wasn't answering
Nothing I said, I started getting fed and turning red
Then, I told her just a bit about Ted
She gave a wink and started to think
But didn't believe a thing about the New Jack Swing

[Chorus]
(""You got to get down, you got to get down""
""You got to get down, down, down, down"")
Didn't believe a thing about the New Jack Swing
(""You got to get down, you got to get down""
""You got to get down, down, down, down"")
(""Give it, give it, give it to me"")

[Verse 2: Teddy Riley]
1-2-3
I made the New Jack Swing
Yes, T.R., is my name
Making you dance to my thing
Is the way I entertain, baby
I make the beats you like
Yes, that's right, it's outta sight
All my beats are very hype
Yes, G.R. is moving it, right?
I got Keith Sweat, Heavy D
Today, Moe Dee
B. Sure, and my man Bobby Brown
I got Zan the Man, Redhead
Boy George, James and
Deja, and my homeboys Guy
And you got to get fly

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Aqil]
Back to the matter
The New Jack Swing is the sound that can flatter
Any other sound around town doesn't give the
Same type of feeling that this one delivers
So your body shivers, so bad
Some dope beat medicine you wish you had
Dipping your feelings from glad to sad
But you're not getting a thing
So just chill and get whipped by the New Jack Swing

[Chorus]

7,7,Biz Markie,Just A Friend,8,1989-11-04,"

[Intro]
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation

[Verse 1]
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said blah-blah-blah
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, ""How do you like the show?""
She said, ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man,"" she tried to pretend
She said, ""No I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on, I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing

[Hook]
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 2]
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', getttin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Everytime that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewing'
I called her on my dime, picked up, and then I called again
I said, ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust this

[Hook]
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 3]
So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend

"
8,8,The D.O.C.,It's Funky Enough,9,1989-11-04,"

[Intro]
Y'all ready for this
Rastafara Sonna Madda Fa
Drop the lyrics, a'ight

[Verse 1]
One, and here comes the two to the three and four
Then I drop the beat I have in store
Lay dynamics on the top like a rug
Make it sound smooth and later make a dub
Enunciate well, so that you can tell
I am not illiterate, no not even a little bit
Nothin' like an idiot, get it
You want the record, cool, I'm with it
Let the rhythm take you, shake it cause it makes you
As I turn the knob of the door you escape through
Go in like a knot, don't be a puff
And I let it play cause Dre's getting funky enough

[Hook]
It's funky, it's funky [X4]
Dre makes the beats so fun-fun-funky
It's gettin' funky, it's gettin' funky [X4]
Watch the smooth lyrics that take place

[Verse 2]
If you want another reason why it must be funky
Yo, I am not a jackass meanin' not a donkey
So I will play the game like it should be played
Drop the funk into the mix so the place will never fade
Ship it the the stations in your jurisdiction
Brothas say I'm dope, and the others say I'm bitchin'
No crowd can avoid the D-O to the C
When I'm P-E-R-F-O-R-M-I-N-G
On the stage, see the simple fact is I am dope
And known, I rock a funky beat without a cord so
It is my conclusion you will enjoy the fusion
And I will ascend with the style I am using
Knowin' that it's tough and it's not a bluff
I think I'll let it play cause Dre's hittin' funky enough

[Hook]
Dre make the funky hip-hop music so check it

[Verse 3]
Listen to the kick, drop in with the click
And with no rehearses I'm dropping funky verses
Stupid with the bit that you think you are relying on
You love it when it rattles is the fact that I'm buying on
Suckers never come close cause of knowing
There is no stopping the D.O.C. when I'm flowin'
But in the event that someone will try and juice this
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
I don't give a damn, don't think that I am jokin'
Cause I don't think he is funny when you're messing with my money
Yo people tell me this, yo Dre you must stop him
But with no frills, so I just drop him
Continue with the rhyme and make sure I get mine
With no static cause that's all I need to get my nine, but
Lessons have been learned now all kidding have been fronting
Let it play when the people say, Dre yo you're getting funky enough

[Hook]
Deal with the D-O to the C

[Verse 4]
I need a break so I can check around
See who the hell who is sittin' down
I want all chairs off the floor
And if he stands to the wall, show him the door
And the PK nothing giving you something to rock to
To go nonstop to, not have to look at the clock you
Percieve, but can't believe you're being taken
By a beat so cool you start shaking
And shivering, cause I'm delivering the answer
Haven't seen you're a hellified dancer
You tried sittin' but it just won't work
Cause the beat is so fresh
Don't even tell it won't be funky enough

[Hook]
And with the help of the Dr. Dre, kick it

[Outro]
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now, right
It's getting funky on the mix now
Put it in the needle, and drop it on the one, boy

"
9,9,Heavy D & The Boyz,Somebody For Me,10,1989-11-04,"

Oh yeah..

Love somebo-dy...

(Al B. Sure! harmonizes)

(Chorus 2X: Al B. Sure!)
Love somebo-dy who loves me for me
Happy hap-py where I wanna be

(Heavy D.)
I'll search low, and I'll search high
Tryin to find myself a cutie pie
But destiny leads me to a dead end
(love somebo-dy) Over and over and over again
They told me to wait, so I waited
Anticipated, debatin and delayed it
But still came up with the same ol' thing
..Nothing! (Nothing, nothing...)
It seems as if every time I find a right girl
She turns out to be a big wrong girl
Tell me y'all, when will this madness stop?
(stop, stop, stop, stop...)
I want somebody to love me for me
Not because I'm MC, Heavy D
I'm looking for a love that's as solid as a rock
(rock, rock, rock, rock...)

(Chorus 2X w/ Heavy D. saying ""for me"")
(Heavy D. (Al B. Sure!))
Now maybe I'll take a trip around the world
And find myself a beautiful, gorgeous girl
They say when you look, one never find
They also say that love is blind
It ain't that blind that I can't see
Somebody out there who's perfect for me
Somebody who's gonna love me, for me...
(I know you want love...)
Love, THAT'S what I'm talkin about
A relationship, a commitment
Something to live for...
(Maybe if you take, your time...)
Time has been taken and time has been spent
Now it's time for the lover to score...

(Chorus 2X)
(Instrumental for about 17 seconds)

(Chorus 2X)
Yo, Eddie F. break it down!

(Instrumental for about 34 seconds as Heavy D. ad-libs)

(Heavy D.)
Yeah...aight, here we go
So that's the storyline of my life
No cutie PIE, no future wife
Just relationships that bounce back like rubber...
(""Yo, word to the mutha!"")
I guess I'll call it a day and throw my towel in
'cause it seems that I can't win
So I'll just carry on being an Overweight Lover
(""Word...to...mutha!"")

(Chorus until fade)

10,10,De La Soul,Say No Go,11,1989-11-04,"

POS:
Now let's get right on down to the skit
A baby is brought into a world of pits
And if it could've talked that soon
In the delivery room
It would've asked the nurse for a hit
The reason for this?
The mother is a jerk
Excuse me, Junkie
Which brought the work of the old
Into a new light
What a way
But this what a way
Has been a way of today
Anyway
Push couldn't shove me to understand a path to a basehead
Consumer should erase it in the first wave
But second wave forms believers
And believers will walk to it then even talk to it and say...
(You got the body now you want my soul)
Nah, can't have none of that, tell 'em what to say Mase...

SAY NO GO

DOVE:
Nah, no my brother
No my sister
Try to get hip to this
Word, word to the mother
I'll tell the truth so bear my witness
Fly like birds of a feather
Drugs are like Pleather
You don't wanna wear it
No need to ask that question, just don't mention
You know what the answer is...

POS:
Now I never fancied Nancy
But the statement she made held a plate of weight
I even stressed it to Wade

DOVE:
Did he take any heed?

POS:
Nah, the boy was hooked, you could've phrased the word ""Base""
And the kid just shook
In his fashion class once an A now an F
The rock rules him now
The only designs left
Were once clothes made for Oshkosh
Has converted to nothing but stonewash

DOVE:
Now hopping in a barrel is a barrel of fun
But don't hop in if you want to be down, son
Cause that could mean down and out as an action
What does it lead to?
Dum-da-dum-dum
People say what have I done for all my years
My tears show my hard-earned work
I heard shoving is worse than pushing
But I'd rather know a shover than a pusher
Cause a pusher's a jerk

SAY NO GO

POS:
Believe it or not the plot forms a fee more that charity
But the course doesn't coincide with the ride of insanity
Is it a chant that slants the soul to fill for it?
I know it's the border that flaunts the order to kill for it

DOVE:
Standing, scheming on a young one
Taking his time, eight-ball for a cool pool player
Racked it all, tried to break, miscued
Got beat by the boy in blue
Next day you're out by the spot once more
Looking hard for a crack in the hole
I ask what's the fix for the ill stuff
Word to the Dero
The answer should have been no

POS:
Run me a score from the Funky Four Plus One More
(It's the joint!)
Rewind that back
This is the age for a new stage of fiend
Watch how the zombies scream
It's the crack
Plain is plain it should explain it from the start
Behind the ideals of cranking up the heart
Now the base claim's shot over every part

[Ice-T]
E-V-I-L E and Ice-T are on a jack move
Layin down the dope groove, smokin those who disapprove
Wreckin the deck, you'll regret if you cross punk
Rollin like a Mack truck, waxin those who talk junk
Violent your end, I got your face in my crosshairs
Wanna see your dome bust sucker cause I don't care
Nuttin bout you, your crew, because you talk shit
I'm the Lethal Weapon boy, ridin the apocalypse
If you're in my way, then lay beneath the ground soon
Violence is my business fool, the microphone of doom
Mission that's to cure all punks as I bust caps
Peelin your back, my ammunition hollow-point raps
You try to run, that makes it even more fun
I just cold lamp and vamp you with the shotgun
Cops try to flex.. but guns they'll never find..
My Lethal Weapon's my mind!

[Hook: Rakim]
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
A lethal weapon..
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin

[Ice-T]
You hit the deck, as rap busts from my lips
You think I'm finished - I load another clip
Look in my face, I crack an evil grin
Lyrics bring death from the microphone Mac-10
Sucker MC's, you ain't down with the Syndicate
Try to kick game, but end up talkin weak shit, yo
You're weak, you're wack, you need to quit you lil punk bitch
Go and freak your mother, go dig a damn ditch
Get out my face, I'm tired of the press too
You write about me, I write about you
You think I'm violent, but listen and you will find..
My Lethal Weapon's my mind!

Chorus

[Ice-T]
Up against the wall - it's Valentine's Day
The Massacre's about due for a replay
I'm about to explode - like a hand grenade
Evil E do damage on the crossfade
{*Evil E scratches*} Cuts like a battleaxe
You try to bite, get iced, my raps are boobytraps
Claim of mine, designed by the Ice himself
You beg for mercy as you read the hand you're dealt
{*screaming ""Ah ahh ahh AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!""*}
Cause there's no let up, you walked into a set up
It's suckin you down and now you can't get up
Why because you froze the moment we met up
And I never run punk, I go head up
I ain't no fool and new jack poppin fake rap
I rap from the heart and soul, where only facts are kept
Many rappers sell-out pop and other MC's slept
I ain't in no playin mood, so nigga watch your step
Cause if you cross the boss, you go to bed quick
Know my situation boy, don't diss the Syndicate
Cause when we chose to move, you're gone
And no remains they'll find..
My Lethal Weapon's my mind!

[Hook]

[Ice-T]
More bodies than John Gotti, the Lethal Weapon is slaying
Just open any book, that's ammo to the brain
What really matters, is how well is your weapon trained
Some would say genius, while others would say insane
The Weapon power has been witnessed upon my page
From Martin Luther's ""dream"", to Hitler's psycho rage
What's more powerful - the brain or a twelve gauge?
The words I speak have scared many people to this stage
But promote violence, I really have to disagree
It's entertainment, like ""Terminator"" on TV
But some'll never see, you're stupid ignorant and blind
The Lethal Weapon's the mind!

[Hook]

[Ice-T]
The mind..
Think!

The mind..
YouknowhatI'msayin?
I got my jammy with me at all times, youknowhatI'msayin?
They can't take this one thing away from me
That's got more power, than any gun in the world, youknowhatI'msayin?
I'm talkin bout brain power homeboy
They can't mess with me cause I'm too smart for them out there
YouknowhatI'msayin? Fully strapped, always packed
Go to the library and get some more ammo, youknowhatI'msayin?

The glamorous life (go! go! go!) x 4

(Cool C)
She's a glamorous girl
And she came to rock my world
All the guys they wanna get with her
Step back cos you know you can't get her
First of all you gotta have money
Just in order to be her honey
But hey that's down the line
Cos I like a girl that's fine
Give her everything she wants
Gold and money so she can flaunt
And show that she got Gucci, Louis Vuitton
MCM styles of every kind
Mecca designed alpinas
This girl man, you gotta just see her
Sooner or later she'll be my wife
And that's when we'll live the glamorous life

All the girls envy my wife
Just because she's in the glamorous life
What she got they wanna get with it
But they're not doing nothing to get it
We're the talk of the town
Every time that we roll around
Other girls they just get jealous
When they smell her Perry Ellis
Or Obsession, or her Posion
You keep her away from the boys 'em cos
They might try to disrespect you
But don't let them upset you
Cos yo, they not that thoro'
To take away your girl
A girl that has no price
When she's in the glamorous life

But when I was with that nut, EST
He didn't give me nothin'
It's like my mum used to say...

We gonna use what we've got, to get what we want

Yeah, girls like you Michelle is hard to find
That's why I had to make you my wife
So you could live the glamorous life

14,14,Boogie Down Productions,You Must Learn,15,1989-11-04,"

[Hook]
Just like I told you, you must learn

It's calm yet wild the style that I speak
Just filled with facts and you will never get weak in the heart
In fact you'll start to illuminate, knowledge to others in a song
Let me demonstrate the force of knowledge
Knowledge reigned supreme
The ignorant is ripped to smithereens
What do you mean when you say I'm rebellious
Cause I don't accept everything that you're telling us
What are you selling us the creator dwellin' us
I sit in your unknown class while you're failing' us
I failed your class cause I ain't with your reasoning
You're tryin' make me you by seasoning
Up my mind with see Jane run, see John walk in a hardcore New York
Come on now, that's like a chocolate cow
It doesn't exist no way, no how
It seems to me that in a school that's ebony
African history should be pumped up steadily, but it's not
And this has got to stop, See Spot run, run get Spot
Insulting to a Black mentality, a Black way of life
Or a jet Black family, so I include with one concern, that
You must learn

[Hook x2]

I believe that if you're teaching history
Filled with straight up facts no mystery
Teach the student what needs to be taught
Cause Black and White kids both take shorts
When one doesn't know about the other ones' culture
Ignorance swoops down like a vulture
Cause you don't know that you ain't just a janitor
No one told you about Benjamin Banneker
A brilliant Black man that invented the almanac
Can't you see where KRS is coming at
With Eli Whitney, Haile Selassie
Granville Woods made the walkie-talkie
Lewis Latimer improved on Edison
Charles Drew did a lot for medicine
Garrett Morgan made the traffic lights
Harriet Tubman freed the slaves at night
Madam C.J. Walker made the straightening comb;
But you won't know this is you weren't shown
The point I'm gettin' at it it might be harsh
Cause we're just walkin' around brainwashed
So what I'm sayin' is not to diss a man
We need the 89 school system
One that caters to a Black return because
You must learn

[Hook]

""Alkebulan"" is the original name
Of Africa, now stripped of it's fame
It's good to know that in ancient times
Egyptians developed all sciences of the mind
To the point where they ruled the planet
But Rome, Greece, and Persia wasn't havin' it
They attacked, and won the war
But it wasn't enough, they had to get to the core
Cause in that time it was Alkebulan
That ruled religion, politics, and man
In order to destroy the Egyptian race
They had to wipe the sciences from off the face of the planet
So they proceeded to ban it
Then replace it with Christianity
And it's, been that way, all the way to today
Learn what we teach; hear what we say
But here comes the K-the-R-the-S-the-O-the-N-the-E
The BDP and we rhyme intelligently
Let me continue with Theodosyius
A Greek ruler not known to most of us
He, in the fourth century A.D.,
Calls the Egyptians fools you see
Two years later, Justinian rules
Six A.D., was it for schools
As a result, ignorance had swirled
Over Christian Europe and Greco-Roman worlds
This went on for a thousand years
Of ignorance, stupidity, and tears
Now comes the seventeenth century hardness
Europe, began to come out of it's darkness
So Johann F. Blumenbach, a German
Came out of nowhere and started confirming
White supremacy and men of colors
Before this time, all men were brothers
It was Johann, who went on to say
There are five different colors in the world today
That's caucasian, malayan, and mongolian
American-Indian, and ethiopian
Yet, the ignorance gets scarier
He believed whites were superior
According to his idiotic fountain
The purest whites were from the Caucas mountains
J. A. Blofener, and H. S. Chamberlain
Both supported this outrageous racism
This went on to what the master race should be
And why they killed the Jews in Germany
Here is the reason why I'm so concerned
Because you, must, learn!!!!

[Verse 1]
1989 the number another summer (get down)
Sound of the funky drummer
Music hitting your heart cause I know you got soul
(Brothers and sisters, hey)
Listen if you're missing y'all
Swinging while I'm singing
Giving whatcha getting
Knowing what I know
While the Black bands sweating
And the rhythm rhymes rolling
Got to give us what we want
Gotta give us what we need
Our freedom of speech is freedom or death
We got to fight the powers that be
Lemme hear you say
Fight the power

[Hook]
Fight the power
We've got to fight the powers that be

[Verse 2]
As the rhythm designed to bounce
What counts is that the rhymes
Designed to fill your mind
Now that you've realized the pride's arrived
We got to pump the stuff to make us tough
From the heart
It's a start, a work of art
To revolutionize make a change nothing's strange
People, people we are the same
No we're not the same
Cause we don't know the game
What we need is awareness, we can't get careless
You say what is this?
My beloved lets get down to business
Mental self defensive fitness
(Yo) bum rush the show
You gotta go for what you know
Make everybody see, in order to fight the powers that be
Lemme hear you say
Fight the power

Fight the power
We've got to fight the powers that be

[Verse 3]
Elvis was a hero to most
But he never meant shit to me you see
Straight up racist that sucker was
Simple and plain
Mother fuck him and John Wayne
Cause I'm Black and I'm proud
I'm ready and hyped plus I'm amped
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamps
Sample a look back you look and find
Nothing but rednecks for 400 years if you check
Don't worry be happy
Was a number one jam
Damn if I say it you can slap me right here
(Get it) lets get this party started right
Right on, c'mon
What we got to say
Power to the people no delay
To make everybody see
In order to fight the powers that be

Dr. Dre: Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin' but scared to kick reality
Ice Cube: Man, you've been doin' all this dope producing, but you ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
Dr. Dre: So what you want me to do? ... (Express yourself)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I'm expressing with my full capabilities
And now I'm living in correctional facilities
Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm dropping flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat and that'll make you think
Some suckers just tickle me pink
To my stomach, cause they don't flow like this one
You know what? I won't hesitate to dis one
Or two before I'm through, so don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well I'm dropping English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess
Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothing
But making a sucker and you equal, don't be another sequel

[Hook]
Express yourself
Come on and do it

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Now, getting back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressing ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again, yo, you on the other end
Watch a brother saying dope rhymes with no help
There's no fessing and guessing while I'm expressing myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants them to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Some musicians curse at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality but you won't hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show they go looking for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio, hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!""
But you know it ain't all about wealth as long as you make a note to...

[Hook]
Express yourself
Come on and do it

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
From the heart cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, moving like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessing, I got a Smith and Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, getting physical
Doing the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob
Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growing, just like a fetus
Or a tumor but here's the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressing myself, Yella slam it
Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doing damage
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straight jacket
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it
So, when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we getting hype tonight
Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just

[Hook]
Express yourself
Come on and do it

[Erick Sermon]
The employees of the year, yeah we're back to work
I took time off, while other rappers got jerked
Due to the fact they wack and their track
Have to go back and stack cause they lack
The ingredients EPMD and scratch for that
*DJ Scratch cuts and scratches*
Yo, I'm the hip-hopper, plus the show shocker
Down with MD, yes the microphone doctor
One wrecks, the other destroys
And if you think that you're ready to mess (kill the noise)
We don't play when it's time to slay
I get a cut from my homey, yo, then I lay
Back and mack and all the rhymes I pack
And wait for a sucker to jump and then attack

[Parrish Smith]
Well, I'm known to be the master in the MC field
No respect in eighty-seven, eighty-eight you kneel
Cause I produce and get loose, when it's time to perform
Wax a sucker like Mop & Glow (that's word born)
Smacked a second time, but on a different assignment
And do a sucker new jack who needs a rappin' alignment
Cause I'm the cream of the crop when it's time to do a show
Girlies on my jock for my dope intro
As I glance at E-Double, king microphone wrecker
Turn on my cordless, sayin' mic checka
To the ladies ... and all party goers
Some call me freak, and others slow flower
Brothers on my jock, for the way I hold a piece of steel
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?

[Erick Sermon]
Puttin' heads to bed, straight out the box
MCs are jumpin' out shoes and socks
I'm not playin', understand what I'm sayin'
Catch a sucker in my way, and I'm slayin'
Takin' no shorts, showin' vital sign
You can tell by my lines that I'm gettin' mines
In '89, because I'm fine as wine
Sit back and recline, watch the sun shine
Take a stroll, listen to rock and roll
Catch a flick at the movies, dance a bowl
What I choose I refuse to slack while I'm back
I take a chance jack, so I must attack
With knick knack paddywack so I won't lack
Oh my style is def, and as deadly as crack

[Parrish Smith]
While I'm slayin' music's playin', a sucker is the lame
Battle in the trenches where the funky beat playin'
Cause with a partner like E Double don't come a dime a dozen
A kin not blood related, but you can call us cousins
Cause as we climb the charts, better known as statistics
Brothers on my jock while I'm kickin' ballistics
Droppin' hits like 'I'm Housin,' 'You Gots To Chill,' and more
The proof is in the pudding (yo check the Billboard)
People round town talkin' this and that
Of how we sound like the R, and our music was wack
Dropped the album Strictly Business and you thought we was bold
Thirty days later, the LP went gold
So what you sayin?

[Erick Sermon]
Now party people it's time for the exquisite
No knock knock who that over there or who is it
It's the E-R-I-C-K, yes the Boy Wonder
No fouls no bleeps no bloops or no blunders
So hot, so you can say I'm blazin
Or Luther Vandross says, yo I am
""Sooooooo amazing, and I've been waiting""
For a sucker to attack yo me the E-Double
Cuz me and PMD is like the funky fresh couple

[Parrish Smith]
I fight fire with fire, that's why most retired
And when we needed a piss boy, you was hired
Cause you was Memorex, for that style that we was bringin'
In an all-out battle, P comes out swingin'
Cause I'm just the type of brother that's out to get mines
And if the odds against me, I still drop lines
And get mines on time that's why most resign
Sit in my La-Z-Boy chair, relax my head and recline
Sip a Pepsi or Coke, with a twist of lime
Or crack a forty-oh, and then I go for mine
So what you sayin'?
So what you sayin'?

Hey...hey Leroy...Leroy
>>Yeah
Did you hear about that boy Mike Tyson?
>>Mike...Mike Tyson he's the boy
>>That played football from Montreal ain't he?
No no you old coot, he a...he a boxer man
>>Yeah
Let me tell ya I went to his fight a couple months ago
I seen him hit this boy, and he hit the boy so hard
His head flew off into the eigtheenth row
(laughing) They had to get his head out of the eighteenth row

[Verse One: Prince & >>Jeff]
I was in Jeff's crib one night about eight
And we were watchin' a couple of Mike Tyson fight tapes
Jeff was like...
>>Man, you see how hard Mike's punchin'?
Come on Jeff the other guy was just lungin'
Left, right, left, right, another K.O
If that was me I'd a been okay though
The very next day I gave Russell a ring
With J.L. and Lyor we all called Don King
I said ""Yeah, Don I got a problem
>>Tell 'em Prince
Yeah what's up? what you sayin? You tryin' to solve 'em?
Forget the small talk, let's get to the nitty gritty'
Me and Mike, two months, Trump, Atlantic City.""
>>Yo, you got this you gonna bust dude up
Yeah, you can be my trainer
>>Word up?
I'm rough like a freight train smooth like ice

[Old men]
>>Ain't that the boy who knocked the guy's head in the fifteenth row?
Hey Leroy, you read the paper?
That boy done lost his mind

[Verse Two: Fresh Prince & //Lawrence the Barber]
There was press conference to see what trainin' I was doing
Before then I had never heard reporters booing
Cameras flashing, I was in the middle
I didn't wanna look dumb so I exagerrated a little
I said, ""Uh, I been trainin' twenty hours a day
Liftin' big old cars and big bails of hay
And I jog 10,000 miles every morning
Thinkin' about Mike and my moment of glory
I drink water, 20 gallons a pop
And I can throw a Volkswagon a whole half block
And 4 million sit ups...in a minute....
..I ain't lyin' I did it!""

The general public thought I was a fool
I was gettin' dissed but I guess that was cool
Well gettin' dissed is never good
But I was even gettin' dissed in my old neighborhood
I was at the corner at the top of my block
There was a couple of people standin' outside of the barber shop
It was Lawrence, my barber and friend
And he yelled out:
//Hey, Prince, you can win!
I said 'really?' and I stopped to chat
//You could beat him man, if you hit him wit a bat
//Ha ha...you gon' get wrecked
//But can I have your shoes when he break your neck?
Everybody was laughin' out loud
I thought at least my own Grandma would be proud
I went to her house and snuck in to surpise her
I heard her on the phone
""A thousand bucks on Tyson!""

[Verse Three: Prince, #Ring Announcer]
It's fight day and man am I hyped
Woah, I can't wait to see Mike
Boy I'm hyped, ready to do my thing
Trump Castle Casino [bell rings]
#In this corner...weighin' in at a mere 165 pounds
#The Lightin' Rodent, the Fresh Prince!
#And in this corner
#The heavyweight champion of the world
#Iron Mike Tyson

I came out hustling, slidin' and grabbing
Slippin' and dippin' hustlin' and jabbin'
For a second I looked good out there
But then Mike brought to reality my worst nightmare
One punch, that's all it took (oooh)
He hit me in my ribs and my insides shook
Now how can I say this and be a little discreet?
Let's just say that my bowels released
I called timeout and went back to my corner
Said to my coach, ""Ain't no way I'm goin'
The hell back out there, man you can't forget it
My body's like a punchin' bag and Mike is gonna (Hit it)""
They tried to make me go meet my doom
But I sucker punched my coach and hauled to my dressin' room
The next day the headline in the town
""Fresh Prince breaks camp, Tyson wins, first round""
Some fool asked why I ran away
I said, ""A good run is better than a bad stand any day""
My career is over as far as fightin'
But I don't know what made me think I can beat Mike Tyson

[Outro: Prince and >>Jeff as old men]
Hey Leroy!
>>Yeah
Did you see the fight? did you see the fight?
>>The..the..the football player?
No the boxer, come on man
I was at the fight last night
I paid four hundred and seventy fo' thousand dollars
For my ticket right...
>>Ah, you weren't at no fight
>>I seen you around here last night
..and the boy..the boy ran out the ring
>>You always lying
I ain't lying...
>>You lie to your grandkids..
..I seen it...
>>...you been lyin' ever since you was a little kid
...Mike Tyson punched the boy in his ribs, and his leg fell off
His leg fell off and it fell over...
>>...you always lying
...and it knocked the HBO camerman's camera fell out his hand
I said, god damn, I couldn't beleive it Leroy
You shoulda been there...you definetly shoulda been there
>>...I was right next to you playin' checkers

You gotta let the people, scream and shout
Ahh.. Rob Base, dance it out (Go! Go! Go! Go!)
(Go! Go! Go Base!)
You gotta let the people, scream and shout, ahhhh!
(Go! Go! Go! Go!) (Go! Go! Go Base!)

[Verse One: Rob Base]
Let's take it from the top, keep movin (MOVIN!)
The beat is real swift, it's groovin
Rob is here, put it in gear, lend your ear
Cause the beat is real funky, dear
Let's rock'n'roll with soul, I hold the mic of gold
Because Rob is in full control
Maintain to gain the fame I want, I seek
From rhyme for rhyme, on down to beat the beat
Let it play!  Dance to it o-kay?
I knock 'em all out like Sugar Ray
Top contender, on the hit list
I like the music fast just like this
Easy to dance to, for the people
The kinda beat that you want to beat to
On the dance floor, you keep movin
Throw it all, let it be proven

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Verse Two: Rob Base]
Don't stop the music, keep it goin
Cause peace and love and happiness is what I'm showin
I don't care or fear or shed a tear about things..
.. that I heard by ear
People walk and talk and say things
To put you down, tell me what joy that bring
I make music for the people to dance to..
.. not for one individual
On stage I'm comin up, rhymes I summon up
Takes more than talk for Rob to just give up
I'm blowin hard with the strength of the hurricane
To make you dance is all that I wanna gain
I make hits everytime I write one
Won't get mad if an MC bite one
Cause I like to rock and party with the people
Rob is considered an equal

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Verse Three: Rob Base]
Let's rock and roll and shake and break
And give and take the styles I use cause I create
The rhymes I make you ate you fake cause I relate
And I hate to leave a party at eight
Love to dance and party and move and soothe the crowd
Cause Rob is on the mic, how you like me now?
Let's flex and flirt cause I do work
And go beserk, cause it really won't hurt
To do shows y'know, with strength to motivate
I hate to wait, now I trust in my own fate
I conduct, construct, they said I made it with luck
So what?  I'm makin cash that's buff!

[Chorus One]

[Chorus Three - variation of Chorus Two]
Rob Base!  Ah-won't you turn it out
You gotta let the people, scream and shout
Ahh.. Rob Base, dance it out (Go! Go! Go! Go!)
(Go! Go! Go Base!)
You gotta let the people know what you all about, ahhhh!
(Go! Go! Go! Go!) (Go! Go! Go Base!)

[Verse Four: Rob Base]
Let's keep on and, keep it in the mornin
Don't start yawnin, I gotta keep goin
The rhymes I'm showin, gotta keep flowin
You know y'know when the rhymes I'm throwin
Gotta be hard, you must be a retard
If you think the Base, is gonna fall off like an old star
Fast like lightning, loud like thunder
Mmmmmmm... it makes you just wonder
How I got better, after a short time
I sat back, wrote a bunch of dope rhymes
Said 'em to myself - they went like THIS!
Sure not even one would miss
The mic is mine, I got 'em in line, I'm one of a kind
I designed the rhyme behind the line
The force I push with breaks and beats so fast or slow
You know they grow from pop to rock and roll
From jazz to house to punk to SOUL..
.. anything I touch is gold!

[Chorus One] + [Chorus Two]

[Chorus One] - 1/2

[Verse Five: Rob Base]
Comin to the end, the max, don't ask
Where I got the tracks, my rhymes are buildin up in stacks
Dance to it, get to it
Do it, twenty seconds left, get through it
Rock from show to show, I go, rhymes that flow
Keepin it up, with the fast tempo
Gotta keep on, gotta keep on, word is bond
The beats are fly, the rhymes are ON!

35,143,Young M.C.,Principal's Office,19,1989-12-09,"

[Intro]
Now normally if I can help But I don't spend a lot of time in a principal's office
(RING!!!)
What?
9'o clock

[Verse 1]
Now as I get to school I hear the late bell ringing
Runnning through the halls, I hear the glee club singing
And as I get to the office I can hardly speak
Cause it's the third late pass that I got this week
So to my first class I run and don't walk
All I hear is my sneakers and the scratching of chalk
And as I get to the room I hear the teacher say
""Mr. Young I'm very happy you could join us today""
I try to sit down so I can take some notes
But I can't read what the kid next to me wrote
And if that wasn't enough to make my morning complete
As I try to get up, I find this gum on my seat
So with the seat stuck to me, I raised my hand
And said, ""Excuse me but can I go to the bathroom, ma'am?""
The teacher got upset, and she screamed out ""No!
It's off the principal's office you go.""

[Verse 2]
12 o'clock comes with mass hysteria
Everybody rushes down to the cafeteria
Picked up my tray to have Thursday's lunch
And as I tried the apple sauce, I heard it crunch
I'm running up the stairs with my front tooth broken
The nurse just laughed, and said you must be joking
I looked up at her with a smile on my face
No joke cause my front tooth is out of place
So I walked to school with ice on my lip
The nurse's late pass like a gun on my hip
My books are real heavy, I'm walking, I'm dragging
Ain't no school lunch next week, I'm brown-bagging it
Forget class, I'm a shoot some ball
With the late pass I got no trouble at all
But then the nurse walks up and says ""What do you know?
It's off to the prinicipal's office you go.""

Recess!

[Verse 3]
Passing notes is my favorite pastime
I can't wait to find a girl to pass mine to
To express my feelings
Give me a week B, and the girl'll be dealing
Now one young lady was looking at me
I said ""Hi my name is Marvin, known as Young MC""
But then the ball rang, and the teacher came in
And that's when the game of passing notes would begin
I wrote the first note, told her she was fine
And I hoped that the two of us could spend some time
She wrote me back and told me ""You're fine too
I'd love to go on a date and spend some time with you""
So then I sat there reeling, and looking at the ceiling
Words can't express the way that I was feeling
Then I thought to myself, the sure way to get her
Is to write another note, oh yes, a love letter
When I finished the note, it was ready to pass
The teacher took it, and read it right in front of the class
She read it word by word and line by line
And everybody who was laughing was a friend of mine
Even then my girl was laughing, and it was too late
For me to write another note cause there would be no date
The teacher looked at me, and I said ""I know
It's off to the principal's office I go.""

Yo, you think this is bad, wait 'til I get my report card

You only live once, and you're not coming back
So express yourself, yeah

CHORUS
Express yourself, you gotta be you and only you, babe
Express yourself, and let me be me
Express yourself, don't tell me what I cannot do, baby
Come on and work your body

Now Joe wanna be like Bob
Bob got it goin' on with no job
And everything Rob got he got from Robin
And everything she got she got ho-hoppin'
My girl Jilly wanna be like Jackie
Fat rope chains and I think that's wick-wacky
Tom and Dick wanna be like Harry
Little do they know he's bitin' on Barry
Stan was a scam, but Vinnie's legit
Mercedes coupe hometroop with no kit
A businessman with a beeper for a reason
Not like Tim because it's in this season

CHORUS

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Hey Pep, you up next

Yes, I'm Pep and there ain't nobody
Like my body, yes, I'm somebody
No, I'm sorry, I'm-a rock this Mardis Gras
Until the party ends, friends
Yes, I'm blessed, and I know who I am
I express myself on every jam
I'm not a man, but I'm in command
Hot damn, I got an all-girl band
And I wear the gear, yeah, I wanna wear it, too
I don't care, dear, go ahead and stare (oooo)
Afraid to be you, livin' in fear (boo)
Expression is rare, I dare you

CHORUS

Oh yeah, oh yeah...
Yo, excuse us while we rap
Go ahead, girls, express yourself!

My party, your party, anytime drop in
Cold hip-hop is always rockin'
Don't you like it when the music drop
Jump, spread out, and stop?
Now bring in the go-go (uh-oh)
Look at how my butt go rock from left to the right
You wanna step to me, groove me
I know you wanna do me
Come on now, fellas, don't fight

At my door they're bum-rushin'
To hear the percussion
Sound of my go-go band
I've long ago learned my lesson
It's all about expression
Will the real Salt and Pepa please stand?
And...

Express yourself, you've got to be you, babe
Express yourself, and let me be me
Express yourself, don't tell me what to do, babe
Express yourself, come on and work that body

Express yourself, you've got to be you, babe
Express yourself, don't tell me what to do, babe
Express yourself, you've got to be you, babe
Express yourself, don't tell me what to do, babe

Express yourself, oh yeah, oh yeah
Express yourself

[Kane] Hey yo Teddy
[Riley] Yo
[Kane] I ran into a young lady Maliya last night
[Riley] Word?
[Kane] Must have been her husband's payday
[Riley] Heheh
[Kane] because she bought me this here brand new
Diamond link that you see me with on
[Riley] Mmm
[Kane] Smooth, you knowhatI'msayin? You know why?
[Riley] Why Kane?
[Kane] Cause I get the job done

[Hook x2]
""I work"" (x3)
""I work.. baby!""

[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
The question at hand, is how do I love thee?
I count the ways but girls don't shove me
One by one you can come and caress me
Undress and molest me but you can't posess me
Because I love a young lady that's beautiful
But one that's smart for me, is more suitable
In other words, to make it simple and plain
You gotta have a brain in order to be Ms. Kane
But in the case of not becomin my lady
I take em eight to eighty, dumb crippled and crazy
Crisp and clean with no caffeine
And a pair of spandex or either tight jeans
Couldn't believe the ones with the Chinese cuts
But I'll take 'em with the weave hangin down to they butts
And if you step up in a large sum
Like Martin Luther King, I Shall Overcome
I get the job done

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Daddy Kane]
Some of you ladies make moves too quick
And settle down, without havin a large pick
Rushed into becoming some poohbutt's wife
And no longer do you enjoy, the married life
Well, I let you know this is a brand new year
So never fear, the Big Daddy is here
To do things in places your husband wouldn't
And do certain things he probably just couldn't
Let me sneak into your life, like a thief in the night
Lick your body all over and squeeze you real tight
Nibble all over your ear and give your back a massage
You'll say, ""Oooh I like it,"" just like DeBarge (how large)
Smooth and mild I'll make you smile, honey child
Then hit the lights and get buckwild
And when I turn her back on, you'll have to say
Like Calgon, please take me away
So when your main course is doin nothin for ya
Just look at me as a tasty side order
That came into your life and brought a thrill
Cause any husband won't, I'm a neighbor who will, get the job done..

[Hook]

T.R., take it to the bridge, uhh!

[Verse 3: Big Daddy Kane]
Here's a perfect description of me
Six foot one, and dark and lovely
And if they're sayin black is beautiful, it's true not phony
I'm Brown-er than Bobby so won't you be my +Tenderoni+
And get a whiff of this nymphomaniac
An up-to-date mack that's ready to attack
And prove that I'm a pro and far from a rookie
Ain't no hair on my chest, but I'm one tough cookie
Whoever said you had to be one-hundred percent
Masculine in order to be in?
I'd rather be more subtle and smooth and SOOTH
Girl, you won't disapprove
And I promise that you'll never forget
Hmmmmmmmmmmm, now what's a title to fit me?
A champ like Tyson, a Captain like Kirk, no
Employee of the Month, cause yo, I do work
The K-A-N-E is on the J-O-B
An expert, cause I get it D-O-N-E
So lights, camera, action - all hail the one!
That gets the job done

And this one's about the KO's, the knockouts out there
Who's holdin' my buddy
Hold up (Wait a minute)

[POS]
Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle
(The Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)

Black medallions, no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos, hangin' out wit Mase
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face

For the lap, Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I'll initiate the buddy with a slap

[Q-TIP]
Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)
The best (ooh wee!)
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick em up, stick em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)

(Sweet little woman, sweet little woman)

[POS]
I won't lie, I love b-u-d-d-y (why)
'Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny I seem
(Very serious) like a Peek Freen
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lift
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff

[AFRIKA]
Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like Silly Putty
Miss Crabtree, I hope that you're not mad at me
'Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

[DOVE]
On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the (Q-Tip: Q to her Tip)
On the A side or sometimes the flip
(Never gonna flip this record)
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

[MIKE G]
Behind my bush, my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Or let loose the juice)
My buddy helps me to
(De La my Soul)
Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll

(La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la)

[Q-TIP]
Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul, here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun, lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy, I will boast
That we're like Ethel Mertz and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mine and I can be your buddy

[DOVE]
The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' lets Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed
(Word)

[AFRIKA]
Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

[MIKE G]
And I watched and then I checked my Swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

[POS]
Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands
(Then Jenny start flockin' it everywhere)
'Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware
Yo fellas, should we keep her aware?

I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
Here's your ticket
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black
Attack so I sack and jack then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it
(You know I like it) huh
Hear my favoritism roll ""Oh""
Never see a brother like me go solo
Laser, anesthesia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm living, forgiven what I'm giving up
X on the flex, hit me now
I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Gear I wear got 'em going in fear
Rhetoric said and read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked
Changing some ways to way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold, never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am, God knows
Cause it's coming from the heart
What I got better get some
Get on up, hustler of culture
Snake bitten, been spit in the face
But the rhymes keep fitting
Respect's been given', how's ya living
Now I can't protect a paid off defect
Check the record and reckon an intentional wreck
Played off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall, broke the laws
Not my fault that they're falling off
Known as fair square throughout my years
So I growl at the living foul
Black to the bone my home is your home
But welcome to the Terrordome

[Verse 2]
Subordinate terror, kicking off an era
Cold delivering pain
My '98 was '87 on a record yo
So now I go Bronco
(Oh-oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Oh-oh-oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Yo, we gotta dust these boys off!)
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag from the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never knew or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basing
Traits of hate who's celebrating with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous
Bobbing and weaving and let the good get even
C'mon down
But welcome to the Terrordome

[Verse 3]
Caught in the race against time, the pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes while I'm bending 'em
Snakes blowing up the lines of design
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power, cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game, a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother cause a Black hand
Squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig

[Verse 4]
It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First nothing's worse than a mother's pain
Of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example of one of many places
The Greek weekend speech I speak
From a lesson learned in Virginia (Beach)
I don't smile in the line of fire, I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums and even violins
Whatcha do getcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad, I put it down on a pad
Give ya something that ya never had
Controlling, fear of high rolling
God bless your soul and keep living
Never allowed, kicking it loud
Dropping a bomb, brain game, intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team, never move alone
But welcome to the Terrordome

My expression to the mountainous blue eyes
Then form a face, and shake my skull cap
Dismiss the myth, that evil is not black
But opposite spectrum, this done by red man
With horns on his head, laid down the ill plan
Got all his helpers, said, ""Make it snappy!
Tell all the people that their hair can't be nappy!""
Blonde and blue-eyed, or dark-skinned heffer, G
A disease, created by leprosy
Don't speak of bleach, bend them to right
Say it was night WAY before the light
Put aside spooks, Serch leaves a trace
I've set em correct with the effect of the Gas Face

[MC Serch]
Next up, Don?

[Don Newkirk]
A special appearance by KMD's Zev Love X!

[Verse Three: Zev Love X]
A Gas Face can either be a smile or a smirk
When appears, a monkey wrench to work one's clockwork
Perkin his brim to the rim of my cup
Don't tempt me, you're empty, so fill'er up!
Is I'm talkin coffee or cocoa, is you loco?
Cash or credit for unleaded at Sunoco
KMD and 3rd Bass is just ace in the hole
I mean soul, so make the Gas Face (HUAHAHA)
Damn, if looks could kill
You look like host was a ghost from your grill
But still, what's the new fed, to recollect
To our passing phase to facades to '80-deca
For my label reads Hood, street might have a tattoo
Don't pick any card or no rabbit from my hat
Never a magician if I ever tricked em
""Oh shit!"" Another Gas Face victim

[MC Serch]
There it is, yo fellas man
Why don't you step to the mic man?

[Zev Love X]
That's how I kicks it, for 80-deca

[MC Serch]
Aiyyo, good lookin out Don man peace
Punji, yo who gets the Gas Face?

[Punji]Little Vic for the Gas Face

50,342,Digital Underground,The Humpty Dance,18,1990-02-03,"

[Verse One: Shock G as Humpty Hump]
All right! Stop whatcha doin', cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny - but yo I'm making money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a ""umpty""
Yo ladies, oh how I like to hump thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat; look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still getting in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

[Hook]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

[Verse Two]
People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's all right cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I use a word that don't mean nothing, like looptid
I sang on ""Doowutchalike"", and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'im in the biscuits""
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance

[Hook]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

[Breakdown]
Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here
Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
Let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

[Verse Three]
First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shaking and twitching kinda like I was smoking
Crazy wack funky
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
That's all right cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humping, funking, jumping
Jig around, shaking ya rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump
Tell him step off, I'm doing the Hump

[Hook]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doing the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Let's get stoopid!

[Hook]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Oh, yeah, come on and break it down

[Outro]
Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world
Keep on doing the Humpty Dance
And to the ladies
Peace, and Humptiness forever

[Heavy D.:]
Coolin in my crib and I'm cold, maxin
Call up a cutie, I'm in the mood for relaxin
Get my phone book from, top o' the shelf
I'll dial 66 - hm, I better keep it to myself
Call up a cutie with a triple star next to it
She says, ""Hello, "" we con-versate a bit
Invite her over for a candlelight dinner
Believe me when I tell you that this girlie is a winner
Shortly after that, I hear the doorbell ring
Turn on the radio, Anita Baker starts to sing
Open up the door and I kiss her on the cheek
She's so nice, polite, petite, so sweet
Sit her on the couch and uh, remove her coat
Squat next to her, *ahem* clear my throat
Whisper in her ear, told her what she wants to hear
Let her know that, ""Have no fear - Heavy D.'s here""
And...

[Chorus:]
Gyrlz they, gyrlz they love me
(Cause he's The Overweight Lover Heavy D!)
Gyrlz they, gyrlz they love me
(Cause he's The Overweight Lover Heavy D!)

[Heavy D.:]
Take my hand, walk with me
I'm the imperial, Overweight Lover MC Heavy D
Now that I've introduced myself correctly
Do you have a moment to spend some time with me?
Would you like a drink, maybe a Piña, Colada
A strawberry Daiquiri, a wine from Havana
It really doesn't matter, the choice is yours
And when you're through with your drink, we'll take a walk out-doors
Gazed at the stars, walked down the boardwalk
Sit by the beach and talk lover's talk
Make a quick call on my cellular phone
Some type of limousine to pick us up and take us home
Ahh! - an enjoyable night
The mood was smooth and everything was alright
It may be hard for you, but it's easy for me
Cause girls, the girls, the girls, THEY LOVE ME!

[Chorus x2]
[DJ Eddie F. cuts and scratches:]
[James Brown:] ""Funky! ""

[Heavy D.:]
Me, Glenn, and Troy went to a disco (word)
Pete Rock and CL Smooth was on stage drinkin Cisco
Damien had his girl Michelle (of course!)
Craig Boogie had a girl that I never seen before
Eddie F. was home makin a beat [scratches]
Mick T. was at the crib on a hundred and twenty-two street (chillin)
Tootie had a cutie that was dope (Damn!)
Groovy Lou, Quan, and Little Dow was crackin jokes (YOU BIG!)
Grapp had the dancefloor packed (GO, GO, GO)
Joe Black was in the corner lookin meanie when he {? }
Tommy, George, Jeff and Butta was on the spot
Buyin champagne from the crew a hundred dollars a pop!
Me, I was casin the joint
Clockin all the people as they stared and point
It feels really good to be Heavy D
Because the girls, the girls, they LOVE me!

Now is the chance to advance and get an outlook
Create the circumstance, because I doubt books
Can relay, words this way, so I'll portray
A new image, and let's begin as
Members who pledge to, look up ahead to
A beautiful world, though we've been led to
Believe it will not be and, we still are seein
Agreein there'll be peace, the wealth will increase
And we'll prosper, you know like flourishin
The rhyme I toss ya, it will be nourisihin
I must bring, ideals for better living see
Because I do believe in positivity

""Positive but never negative""

[Guru]
Weak is the clown, much weaker is the fool
I'll overrule to duel and to school
For reasons that are so deep, I don't need no cheap
People to identify, I just say hi and bye
Since I'm an optimist, I'll turn and walk with this
Tape playing loudly, inside my headphones
MC's that crowd me, turn into headstones
Because I don't have time for, powerless minds or
Suckers who suck, because I find more
Interesting topics, you can not stop it
I drop it and rock it I shock it, that's how I'm livin B
I like to live my life with positivity

""Positive but never negative""
* DJ Premier cuts n scratches *

[Guru]
Havin nothin to lose, so much to gain
Bein grateful for my darker skin, I take you for a spin
And then begin to groove and sooth and move your whole
Crew, the Guru, and truth I wanna give to you
So watch as I break through to your dome
Cause I'm prone to give a message, then back home
Is where I'm goin, still knowin, my life's right
And that days to come, will be fun
I'll achieve, I'll receive, and I'll be livin free
Me and my DJ Premier with positivity... positivity! Yeah

""Positive but never negative""

[ VERSE 1: W.C. ]
Now here we go, y'all gotta play this
(Why?) Cause the others are so scared to say this
Now tell me, what am I supposed to do
About a sucker like you who ain't never paid dues?
Slapper, hip-happer, you're gettin wacker
Your girl better step, or I just might jack her
Smack her like a gangster, but I don't bang
I gank suckers like you for thick gold chains
(He don't deserve it) Hell nah
So take it off your neck
Cause goddamn, you ain't comin correct
What's this, a sucker duck holdin a mic?
Like Keith Sweat said, somethin just ain't right
Seems nowadays everybody wanna be a rapper
Down with crews
But they ain't never paid dues
Suckers perpatratin, playin hardcore
Punks, I bet you worked at a flower store
You know what eats me up the most?
Is when a sucker just started and thinks he's high post
You ain't pay a nann due in your life
Talkin bout a new style, you know who you sound like?
KRS, Chuck D, Kool Moe, as one
Yellin on the mic like the name was Run
You'se a peon, when I bought a pair of Lee's
Now all of a sudden you're supposed to be an MC?
Yo, that's wack, it just ain't right
You only stood on one stage in your whole damn life
Now you want respect, hey yo, you'se a fool
Everybody wanna rap, but they ain't paid dues

[ VERSE 2: W.C. ]
I can still remember way, way back in the days
The times me and Aladdin dreamed of gettin paid
Standin outside just pullin the jacks
To earn a little money to drop a dope track
Back in the days I drove a raggedy Dodge
Couldn't afford a studio, so we used a garage
Aladdin used to grab a gang of disco breaks
One turntable and a broken 808
My little brother Tunes and Frank, they hung around all night
To make sure that the demo was tight
Didn't have an enigneer, if you know what I mean
Aladdin did it all at the age of 16
Gifted, uplifted, I was mad as The Mack
Suckers had me playin the back
But thanks to Ice-T I got my foot in the door
Now I'ma rock the mutha-(uh) till it ain't no more
We paid dues

[ VERSE 3: W.C. ]
I knew a brother who used to dress just like a faggot
Real tight jeans, some boots and leather jackets
Homey as hell, he never came outside
Cause everytime I came around, he used to run and hide
Spoiled like a brat, had everything he wanted
And when he walked, he switched like a woman
Rode a pink bike, man, the sucker was soft
Had to be in before the street lights came on
Yo, just the other day I turned my radio on
The _Mack Attack_ kicked on a brand new song
I didn't know what it was, I never heard it before
But the record was smooth and hardcore
I said to myself, 'Hey yo, I gotta see this group'
So I called up Aladdin and the rest of the crew
Grabbed the nine with the hollow point tip
Stepped in the party with a gangster limp
Took a look at the stage, and yo, what do you know?
The same old faggot from a long time ago
]From real tight jeans and a go-go boot
He went to Pendeltons and a khaki suit
Now tell me, ain't this a blip?
Somebody need to slap the perpetrator in the lip
Yesterday he was a mama boy, now he's rappin?
Foolin the crowd because he got you all clappin
And tappin, an example of what I'm tryin to prove
A sucker like this who ain't never paid dues
To those who wanna rap, I'm pertainin to you
Before you pick up a mic, you gotta pay dues

Let the story be told
That's the way it is
You got to pay your dues

Low Profile definitely into payin the dues
W.C, DJ Aladdin
Frank, my little brother Crazy Toones, Jazzy D
We in there, everypaid they dues
Abracadabra, DJ Aladdin
We outta here

(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby
(They're jingling, baby) Go 'head, baby

[Verse 1:]
They call me Uncle L, Future of the Funk
Records I recorded minus all the junk
People spread gossip and believe what they must
While I slam dunk {fags} and make em bite the dust
A minute is needed to make a phony roni bleed
And put him in a bucket like it's chicken feed
Check out the - pick of the litter, not a quitter, I'm nice y'all
And I'mma dust you off and dust you off twice
You never heard this so observant all hysterical fan-
-natics of the Asiatic miracle man
Prominent, dominant, McCoy and I'm Real
If you're another brother's fan? Forget how you feel
Cause he's so-so, I got the instinct
They call me Deputy Dog, now put your {ass} in the clink
Innovating, devestating, and dope on the single now
Let me see your earrings jingle

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I chopped you, chewed you, baked you and {fucked} you
That {shit} you pop, you need to stop, you're kind of rude you
No good {niggaboo} tryin to base
How we livin Holmes? Get out my face!
I'm complete, in effect, and I can't fall
I rise, suprise, and I advise you all
To stand back and peep, don't sleep or doubt
My skill'll get ill, I turn the mother out
I'm top-notch, you're still playin hop-scotch
Now I'mma do ya while the party people watch
You're real funny, you really try to go for yours
But I know why: you ain't had no dough before
So you tried and lied to drain my fame
This ain't a game, yo, you know my name
Forget all the MC's who like to mingle
Yo baby, let me see your earrings jingle

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
When you first walked in, I ain't know what to think
You grabbed the microphone like your {shit} don't stink
And tried to run down that; I can't get over that
{bullshit} you were sayin - you call that a battle rap?
How you gonna go against an army with a handgun?
I'm Cool J, yo you don't understand, son
I'm a legend, on top of that I'm livin
Now you look stupid like that {bitch} Ms. Givens
Whoever geesed you up; nah, how should I say it?
Whoever set you up, they knew just how to play it
Cause man, YO, I feel for you brother
I'm a baaaaaad... (Word to my mother!)
Takin out suckers while the ladies pucker
And rollin over {niggas} like a redneck trucker
Innovatin, devastatin, and dope on a single, now
Lemme see your earrings jingle

[Chorus]

[Verse 4:]
Yeah baby, you know what I mean?
You like be jinglin crazy, word
(yeah yeah yeah)
All over this funky beat
You be like jinglin, and your earrings be jinglin
And shakin all over the place and all (mm-hmm)
It's like real, it's real wild to me honey yaknahwhatImean?
The way you be jinglin, worrrrrrd

[Chorus]

[Verse 5:]
Can't believe you tried to grip the same mic as me
Your grip's too weak, you can't hold it, B
You can dream of makin progress and gettin this nice
But when I roll up, it's like Hip Hop Vice
I serve to curbs, I never swerve I'm superb
Every word you heard played tricks on your nerves
You played your hand, lost track of your plan
When I show up, I blow up, end of story, my man
I'm a play you like a poker chip, that's what you get
I bet your fret, sweat, and regret you met
The titan of fightin, excitin when writin, you triflin toy-boy
I gotta enlighten, so start bitin
You know you can't create and get mean like this
When I'm on the court, G, it's strictly SWISSSSHHHH!
When it's all over, said and done, my friend
They say, ""That {bad motherfucker} just scored again""
So take a step back, give me some room to wreck shop
Here's your token back, you're gettin off at the next stop
I'mma deliver and give a speech with vigor
I drink some Olde E and start waxin {niggas}

(Yeah)
(Check this out)

[Verse 1: Cold 187um]
When I sit down and write and recite for the mic I hold
Make sure my beats are loud and bold and Cold
187, that is my name, makin' it simple and plain
Here to rearrange and change
The things that I couldn't do in the past
Don't be surprised when you got a shotgun up your ass
Perpetrators, that one was just for you
I'm gonna leave ya in your seat remaining without a clue
Glued to my style like a fiend on coke
But if you say the wrong thing, I wash your mouth out with soap
Dope is not the answer
No, I'm not a Cancer
No, I'm not a hero or zero
But a Leo in stereo
And this is not a demo
K-Oss and Go Mack be cuttin' the flex tempo fast

[Hook] [4x]
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well

[KM.G]
Yo, fingerprints ain't nothin without the murder weapon
Keep steppin'
Homicide tried to sweat, but we let 'em have it
You can see they fear through they teeth
Treat 'em like Rolaids and give 'em some relief

[Verse 2: Cold 187um]
I feel action speaks louder than words and verbs
And adjectives, I live the life, the given gift
Not who's first, second or third
Not he said or she said or what you heard, nerd
Cause when you live like that, your life is mangled
In other words your life is all tangled up
I'm not a sucker, always go for mine
Powerlord that's hard from the start, and he will always (climb)
To the top as high as he can achieve
Sometimes that's even higher than the others believe
I'm not a doctor, not a poet, I don't have a degree
Not arrogant, egotistical, I'm the epitome
We take recon, these suckas are lying
Transform into another world as I recite these rhymes
187, he's as hard as it comes
And I don't have to brag
About the size of my gun, son

[Hook] [3x]
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well

[KM.G]
Criminals don't use lyrics and define themselves as notorious
Brothers gotta learn hip-hop anger rages inside themselves
Your freedom will never resist to my contact K-Oss and the homie G

[Verse 3: Cold 187um]
187 breakin' back, backbone of my group
Fat kid in my posse and I'm gettin' loose
Cause I'm takin out posses, causin' bodily harm
Makin' moves to improve as I begin to brainstorm
I'm not inferior, not takin' no crap
Last sucker tried to diss me, cold got his neck slapped
Cause power's my name, sometimes I'm insane
And if I get too mad, I have to rearrange
Your position as a MC, that's the way it should be
The way I get over, I use terminology
That's comprehensive, redemptive
That's evidently not related to the style that you hear everyday
B-boy destroyin' a toy, employin'
While the other suckers are depressed, I'm enjoyin'
What I'm doin', and ruin anyone's hope for my position
Tell em KM.G, they on a mission

[KM.G]
They on a mission
They keep wishin you can't come off
187, you're a menace in your own mind
So take heed and proceed with caution
When he rhymes

Now I got a murder rap
Here's a murder rap to keep ya dancin'
Now I got a murder rap
Cause a brother like me said well

(Help them. Help our children. Help them. Help our children)

[Chorus]
Will you let them be? (Help the children)
Will you help the children live to see... (Help the children)
A generation's trying (bombs and crack)
Oh, how we're dying
(Dance, help them)
Will you let them be? (Help the children)
Will you help the children live to see... (Help the children)
A better day is coming (we need love)
To keep our lives going

[Verse 1]
Life is here and then it's gone
And what seems right can be oh-so wrong
Let's protect, and not molest... a young girl
And help them live to see... this world
Clearly, as it is
And pray for the mother with kids (kids)
Who's lost control, but not her soul
Many kids will die before they're 20 years old

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Pops (pops) where in the world have you gone
I see Momma (momma) by the telephone
Waiting (waiting) but you don't call
Tears on her face and I see them fall
It hurts (hurts) but will go on
You're just another brother who's left his home
And family (family), yeah we cry
Momma says she love you and I don't even know why (why why why)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Money and death, the lie, the truth
A dime bag of crack, the end of you
Black and white, a constant fight
Years and years, and day and night
There was a right, I've got to stand
To make a better way for a young black man
In a land (a land) where the people smile
Been holding me back for such a long while (while, while, wow, while)

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Help them, will you let them be?
Children (children) don't be fooled
And learn about the way that man was ruled
This country (country) where we live
And read about the sixties and what they did
So that we (we) won't forget
And love one another and give respect
When I see (see) a man who's old
A woman who's grey, it touches my soul
Because I know (know) they paved the way
So we could be here and live this way
There was a time (time) not long ago
When in the-front-of-the-bus into the back I had to go

Kid:
Alright yo
Could you.. could you be quiet for a minute, alright?
C.. Wiz, turn it down Dukes
Hey, could ya'll please shut up?
Wiz, chill!
Yo, Play got something to say

Play:
Alright yo, alright yo
Let's get this together cause it ain't gon' last forever
You know what I'm saying?
Yo, yo, man, don't trash my place
[Hey yo?] Hurb
Bass!

Verse 1:
They come from miles around to check out the sound
Watch the walls come tumbling down
Kid 'n Play is the perfect team
Now it's time to let off some steam
Don't be bashful now, don't be shy
This ain't no time for you to wonder why
You're not on the floor with someone else?
Don't blame us, blame yourself
You ain't got the guts to get with it
The time is now Dukes to admit this is the perfect situation to take a chance in
Cause this is a house that we dance in

Chorus:
Do a little dance now (like this ya'll, like that ya'll)
Feel the groove (I feel it, i feel it now)
Make a little love now (Ooh ah ooh oh ooh ah)
This party's at the funhouse (this party's at the funhouse)

Verse 2:
Now just go, let the beat flow
Not you crow, I don't want to come see your freak show flow
Smooth not slow, be a dynamo
Kid 'n Play says so and yo
Let's flip when the beat rips
Wiz got a gift and we got [the tune?] to shoot it
Your place of mind, anywhere's just fine
And when you're in the mood to unwind you'll find a good time
I'm looking for a great time
If that's too much to ask then I'll pass
Let's settle for a nice time
Anytime's the right time for a Kid 'n Play rhyme
Right here, just fine

Chorus:
Do a little dance now (like this ya'll, like that ya'll)
Feel the groove (I feel it, i feel it now)
Make a little love now (Ooh ah ooh oh ooh ah)
This party's at the funhouse (this party's at the funhouse)
Keep on singing, keep on singing (x3)
This party's at the funhouse (this party's at the funhouse)

Verse 3:
Only a few moments left to step
So you're best to step to her
It's your last chance to do her
You (uh) wanted to know what the good life is?
Beats by Hurb, Rhymes: Kid 'n Play and cuts by Wiz
Just hype it up for this here crowd
[?]
Last call for alcohol at the jamboree
Just get off the walls and cheer for me
Just rock when the beat drops
Watch the clock it's almost time to close up shop
And we got to hip hop harder
[?]
Look out for my father
Kid, make sure ain't nothing been broken
Last record ya'll and I'm hoping we don't get caught because i know her
If mom finds out, I'm over

Chorus (x3)
Keep on singing, keep on singing (x8)

69,516,Professor Griff,Pawns In The Game,17,1990-03-24,"

[Introduction]
You have heard so much about him
But in a few minutes you're going to hear from him

""Ye-eee-ah, ha ha ha""

""Y'all in awe you better get right[?]""

""Listen to me! Listen!
I don't want your applause
I want you to hear what I have to say""

[Verse 1: Professor Griff]
This is the situation, I'll make you understand
My place in this world and how I'm livin' as a black man
Striving to be someone that could be respected
Put on this Earth with a gift
Cause I'm elected by the G, the O, the diggy diggy D
It's like Gomar Oz Dubar
And I swear, (swear you understand this)
Critical, I know the subject is deep
But four hundred and thirty-four years I can't repeat it
I teach you of the global plan
Designed and hatched by the man with the mark in his head
With the mark in his hand
Now, to the man on the board who has very little meaning
No hatin' involved now it's time to start redeemin'
Not makin' it tough, but you have to use your brain
Think about it, we're like pawns in the game

[Verse 2]
Three hundred and sixty degrees, it's a circle
A 10 percent baby, I'll balk 'em
Correct 'em, then I'll leave him speechless
Caressing his ego, then I'll teach 'em this lesson
To the so-called Negroes, the chosen people that needs to grow up
To a freer level of independence, let me tell you what it's all about
To make it clear, to be a prime example
And to erase the fear, who put it in our hearts
I don't mind, but I want no part
Of your total destruction, be it known
Let's continue this function while I'm in my prime
Of letting you all know that it's about time

(Our entertainers can't speak out, poor pitiful things)
(But we got a plan that's grand, see?)
(Y'all wanna hear that beat right, bring that beat back)

[Verse 3]
Pawn is the piece and the piece is controlled
But (brothers and sisters, I know you got soul)
Exodus 21 verse 16 is free and foreseen
Now you know what I mean
Now you can take this, or let it alone
The total solution is not in this song
But now it's too late, you dun sealed your fate
Because the UPC is revealed, there is no escape
Revolution is sweeping the entire nation
Over and over and over, and guess what? (explosion)
Game's over, checkmate

70,522,The D.O.C.,The Formula,23,1990-03-24,"

[Verse 1: The D.O.C.]
High energy flowin' with the wisdom
Sense of a rich man, knowledge and the rhythm
This is what I'm using to come up with a style
So I'll interact altogether better with the crowd
Nervous for a second then the record starts spinnin'
And I fall into the state of mind of what I'd just created
Pump it like the Dr. D into the R.E. suckers ready to leap
Up on the tip when we made it
Creative so I'll never be regarded as a regular
More than just a little bit better than my competitor
You should never underestimate the fashion
I hold for the stage whether I'm coolin' or thrashin''
Clockin' the concoction created by me
When read you read E = the D.O. to the C
Knowledge and the talent that my mother had born to her
Equals an artist that won't be worn, what is that Dre?

[Dr. Dre]
It's the formula

[Verse 2: The D.O.C.]
It's like a message that only I could understand
But those who want to comprehend will again
Be in the midst of the brother
Unlike another in any way
Cause Dre don't play, say what the other say
Originality is a must whenever I bust
A funky composition, it's crush and I trust that you
Know it when you hear a funky record with potential
Me gettin' hype cause Dre rockin' the instrumental
Nothing like what you've heard before and more, never less
See I don't Fess, I mean I'm like fresh if not the freshest
When I'm expressin' my thoughts on
Vinyl, you can't help but listen up and get caught on
Hooked because I cook when I pick up a pen
And begin, in the end it's dope, that's cause I want to win
Knowledge and the talent that my mother had born to her
Equals the DOC, what is it Dre?

[Dr. Dre]
Yo man, that's the formula

[Verse 3: The D.O.C.]
Keepin' it dope as long as I can like imagine
Makin' each record that I do better than the last one
Take a little time, choose the topic and drop it
Release it, the science of makin' dope beats with
Rhythmic American poetry
Shipped it to stations, now many people know of me
I'm the D. into the O. and the O. into the C. and the C. into the period
Suckers are fearin' this
When heard, the dope style calculated by the great wait
And take just a second to get caught up in my record
New but not a kid to be worn
If something gettin' torn up then I'm doin' the
Tearin', not bein' torn
Shapin' up to be one for the top vocalist lyricist
And when you hear of this
You shouldn't choke on this
Knowledge and the talent makes it valid
For me to get it patented
Dre, tellin' what I'm rappin'

[Dr. Dre]
The formula

[Verse 4: The D.O.C.]
In effect and I'm smooth, that's why I'm on the incline
Suckers frontin' for nothin' cause I'm goin' to get mine
It's in the cards and I think I might have read this
So don't lie and try to front like someone said this
Most who know thoughts served by the DOC see
That it's a mission impossible, tryin' to rock me
For an arena who'd ask me to perform for her
G.O. and easily I flow and ya know usin' the formula

71,546,A Tribe Called Quest,I Left My Wallet In El Segundo,22,1990-03-31,"

[Intro]
Toqué ese guitarra!

[Hook: Q-Tip]
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
My mother went away for a month-long trip
Her and some friends on an ocean liner ship
She made a big mistake by leaving me home
I had to roam so I picked up the phone
Dialed Ali up to see what was going down
Told him I pick him up so we could drive around
Took the Dodge Dart, a '74
My mother left a yard but I needed one more
Shaheed had me covered with a hundred greenbacks
So we left Brooklyn and we made big tracks
Drove down the Belt, got on the Conduit
Came to a toll, and paid and went through it
Had no destination, we was on a quest
Ali laid in the back so he can get rest
Drove down the road for two-days-and-a-half
The sun had just risen on a dusty path
Just then a figure had caught my eye
A man with a sombrero who was 4 feet high
I pulled over to ask where we was at
His index finger he tipped up his hat
El segundo, he said, my name is Pedro
If you need directions, I'll tell you pronto
Need a civilization, some sort of reservation
He said a mile south there's a fast food station
Thanks, señor, as I started the motor
Ali said ""Damn, Tip, what did you drive so far for?""

Well describe to me what the wallet looks like

[Verse 2: Q-Tip]
Anyway a gas station we passed
We got gas and went on to get grub
It was a nice little pub in the middle of nowhere
Anywhere would have been better
I ordered enchiladas and I ate em
Ali had the fruit punch
When we finished we thought for ways to get back
I had a hunch
Ali said: pay for lunch, so I did it
Pulled out the wallet and I saw this wicked beautiful lady
She was a waitress there
Put the wallet down and stared and stared
To put me back into reality, here's Shaheed
""Yo Tip man, you got what you need?""
I checked for keys and started to step
And what do you know, my wallet I forget

It was a brown wallet, it had props numbers
It had my jimmy hats, I gotta get it man

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Lord, have mercy
The heat got hotter, Ali starts to curse me
I feel bad but he makes me feel badder
Chit-chit-chatter, car starts to scatter
Breaking on out, we was northeast bound
Jetting on down at the speed of sound
Three days coming and three more going
We get back and there was no slack
490 Madison, we're here, Sha
He said, ""all right, Tip, see you tomorrow
Thinking about the past week, the last week
Hands go in my pocket, I can't speak
Hopped in the car and torped to the shack
Of Shaheed, we gotta go back when he said
""Why?"" I said ""We gotta go
Cause I left my wallet in El Segundo""

[Hook: Q-Tip]
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I got to get it, I got, got to get it
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
I left my wallet in El Segundo
Come on, let's go

[Outro: Q-Tip}​​​
Come on, let's go
Come on, let's go

[Verse 1: Flavor Flav]
Going, going, gone!
Now I dialed 911 a long time ago
Don't you see how late they're reacting
They only come and they come when they wanna
So get the morgue truck and embalm the goner
They don't care cause they stay paid anyway
They treat you like an ace that can't beat a trey
A no-use number with no-use people
If your life is on the line then you're dead today
Latecomers with the late coming stretcher
That's a body bag in disguise y'all, I'll betcha
I call 'em body snatchers cause they come to fetch ya
With an autopsy ambulance just to dissect ya
They are the kings cause they swing amputation
Lose your arms, your legs to them it's compilation
I can prove it to you watch the rotation
It all adds up to a fucked up situation

[Hook x2]
So get up get, get get down
911 is a joke in yo town
Get up, get, get, get down
Late 911 wears the late crown

[Interlude x2]
911 is a joke

[Verse 2: Flavor Flav]
Everyday they don't never come correct
You can ask my man right here with the broken neck
He's a witness to the job never being done
He would've been in full effect
But late 911 was a joke cause they only joking
They the token to your life when it's croaking
They need to be in a pawn shop on a
911 is a joke we don't want 'em
I call a cab cause a cab will come quicker
The doctors huddle up and call a flea flicker
Reason why I say that cause they flick you off like fleas
They be laughing at you while you're crawling on your knees
And to the strength so go the length
Thinkin' you are first when you really are tenth
You better wake up and smell the real flavor
Cause 911 is a fake life saver

Hey, Slim. Come here, check this out
Uh-uh, wait. Let me tell you something
If you ain't got a Bronco, a BMW, [?] or big bank [?]
Aw, I knew it. I knew it. I KNEW IT
Another B girl
Yo [?]
I think it's about time we [?]

[Verse 1]
Now let's bring up the subject
[?] Which we brought to mind
Let's discuss the ""B"" girls
Cause they're one-of-a-kind

Now you can [?]
Wherever you go
Put 'em in your black Benz
Or your blue Bronco

[?]
Everything is chill
With the A C pushin'
In your automobile
You call yourself a lady?
""B"" girl is your name
And if you don't know what ""B"" means
Let us explain

[Hook]
""B"" stands for:
Broncos, Benz, BMW, bass, bangles and a pair of bars
When you see us pulling up down the Ave
You'll act like we are stars

We're not tryin' to make a joke
We're just tryin' to make it known
That people of the world that we call ""B"" girls
Like bars on a Cadillac Brougham.

[Verse 2]
Now that ain't it, and I believe
That we had to rehearse
Another rhyme on the line
For the second verse:
About a girl in the city
Her name is Judy
Had breasts like Dolly
With a big old booty

Well she was [?]
And everything was in place
She was my girl for two years
And [?] doctor [?]

When I took her to [?]
She was frontin' 'bout my Nova
And she wanted a Benz

She said ""We need a Benz""
And all of a sudden, I paused -
Who did Judy think I was?
Santa Claus?
You call yourself Judy
""B"" girl is your name
And if you don't know what ""B"" means
Let us explain:

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now I was pushin' on my rims
With no context [?]
It wasn't BMW
It was BMX
When I seen a young thing
Comin' down the Ave
And I knew from the moment
She's the girl I'd have
So I slammed on the brake
And I asked her name
She said, ""My name is Janet
But my friends call me Jane.""

I said, ""Well Jane, I'm Prince
Can we be friends?""
She said
""Yes, if you could change a BMX to a Benz!""
You call yourself Jane
""B"" girl is your name
And if you don't know what ""B"" means
Let us explain:

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Now me and [?] was at the beach
With a couple of friends --
I parked my Nova by a Bronco
And a baby blue Benz
And pass [?] bottles [?]
So I said, [?]
Already drunk from an overdose
Of malt liquor beer

She turned around
And had a nice figure
She said, ""Can't you see me walkin' my nigga?""

""Hey, so? He's a punk!"" [?]

She said, ""I know he's a punk though
But you in a Nova
And he's in a Bronco!""

She came in my face, she kept yakkety-yakkin'
That's when I popped the trunk, I put the clip in the MAC-10

I'm tired of you ""B"" girls
Yeah, that's your name!

And if you don't know what 'B' means

(Ladies and gentlemen)
Let's make it funky

[ VERSE 1: Greg Nice ]
Hey yo
Dizzy Gillespie plays a sax
Me, myself, I love to max
Redbone booties I'm out to wax
Stick up kids is out to tax
Spring again, and I'm feelin fine
Pass me an ice-cold glass of wine
So I can get mellow
Lay back, and let my girl play the cello
Hello
I hate Jell-O
Let me be me, relax in my tipi
Watch a hardy boy mystery
Greg N-i-c-e
I'm nitro
And I'm hype, so
Don't ever believe
That you can deceive me
See many visions of love and splendor
I'm the real thing, not like a pretender
I rock rhymes over beats on the real tip
Stay real strong and hang on like a vise grip
Use my mind to control all my body parts
Got an early start, plus I'm very smart
Type of man that the girls wanna read about
Indeed I proceed to rock the house without a doubt
Steppin up next, no further ado
Smooth B is gonna make it real funky for you

[ Hook: Pure Blend ]
I'm gonna make it real funky for you

[ VERSE 2: Smooth B ]
Smooth B, notorious, glorious
Knowledge is infinite, I live in a fortress
I'm so astronomical, yet on a physical plane
My body's just a shell, in control is my brain
I strain to gain spirituality
So I can finally be in unity
Harmony with the all eye-seeing
Supreme being
Knower of histories and mysteries
I'm mystic, also stylistic
Not materialistic, simplistic
Humble while others tumble, stumble
Smooth B, not Bumble
Rumble, no, that's not likely
That's in my old 'school daze' like Spike Lee
Smooth B, my rhymes get better with time
I should get an endorsement for creating fresh lines
And as I grow older, lyrics get hyper
Cause I'm a dominant black pied piper
Spreadin peace and love throughout my travels
And take time to read and unravel
Day to day problems, and then solve
Them, I can see clearly now as I revolve
Around suckers
Who perpetrate heroes
But I'm no sandwich
More like a manwich
Or maybe like a meal
Which is much more real
Than Clark Kent or the Man of Steel

Keepin you on the floor, givin you more and more
His cuts exquisite, what is it? A blizzard
The musical wizard you should come visit
The man in the back, without further ado
Teddy Tedd is gonna make it real funky for you

I'm gonna make it real funky for you

Let's make it funky

Greg Nice makes it funky
Smooth B makes it funky
Teddy Tedd makes it funky
Special K makes it funky
DJ Doc makes it funky
And the Blend made it funky

My hooptie rollin', tailpipe draggin'
Heat don't work an' my girl keeps naggin'
Six-nine Buick, deuce keeps rollin'
One hubcap cause three got stolen
Bumper shook loose, chrome keeps scrapin'
Mis-matched tires, and my white walls flakin'
Hit mickey-d's, Maharaji starts to bug
He ate a quarter-pounder, threw the pickles on my rug
Runnin', movin' tabs expired
Girlies tryin' to dis 'n say my car looks tired
Hit my brakes, out slid skittles
Tinted back window with a bubble in the middle
Who's car is it? Posse won't say
We all play it off when you look our way
Rollin' four deep, tires smoke up the block
Gotta roll this bucket, cause my Benz is in the shop

My hooptie - my hooptie

Four door nightmare, trunk locks' stuck
Big dice on the mirror, grill like a truck
Lifters tickin', accelerator's stickin'
Somethin' on my left front wheel keeps clickin'
Picked up the girlies, now we're eight deep

Cars barely movin', but now we got heat
Made a left turn as I watched in fright
My ex-girlfriend shot out my headlight
She was standin', in the road, so I smashed her toes
Mashed my pedal, boom, down she goes
Law ain't lyin', long hairs flyin'
We flipped the skeez off, dumb girl starts cryin'
Baby called the cops, now I'm gettin' nervous
The cops see a beeper and the suckers might serve us
Hit a side street and what did we find?
Some young punk, droppin' me a flip off sign
Put the deuce in reverse, and started to curse
Another sucker on the south side about to get hurt
Homey got scared, so I got on
Yeah my group got paid, but my groups still strong
Posse moved north, headin for the CD
Ridin' real fast so the cops don't see me
Mis-matched tires got my boys uptight
Two Vogues on the left, Uniroyal on the right
Hooptie bouncin', runnin' on leaded
This is what I sport when you call me big-headed
A pot-hole crusher, red light rusher
Musher of a brother cause I'm plowin' over suckers

In a hooptie

It's a three-ton monster, econo-box stomper
Snatch your girly, if you don't I'll romp 'er
Dinosaur rush, lookin' like Shaft
Some get bold, but some get smashed
Cops say the car smokes, but I won't listen
It's a six-nine deuce, so the hell with emissions
Rollin' in Tacoma, I could get burned
(Sound of automatic gunfire) Betta make a u-turn
Spotted this freak with immense posterior
Tryin' to roll smooth through the Hilltop area
Brothers start lettin' off, kickin' that racket
Thinkin' I'm a rock star, slingin' them packets
I ain't wit' dat, so I smooth eject
Hit I-5 with the dope cassette
Playin' that tough crew hardcore dope
The tape deck broke
Damn what's next, brothers in Goretex
Tryin' to find a spot where we could hunt for sex
Found a little club called the N-C-O
Military, competition. You know
I ain't really fazed, cause I pop much game
Rolled up tough, cause I got much fame
""How ya doin' baby, my name is Mixalot""
""Mixalot got a Benz boy, quit smokin' that rock""
Ooooh, I got dissed. But it ain't no thing
Runnin' that game with the home made slang
Baby got ished, Bremelo gip
Keep laughin' at the car and you might get clipped

By a hooptie

Runnin' outta gas, stuck in traffic
Far left lane, throwin' up much static
Input, output, carbeurator fulla soot
""Whatcha want me to do Mix?""
Push freak, push
Sputter, sputter rollin' over gutters
Cars dip low with hard core brothers
Tank on E, pulled into Arco
Cops on tip for Columbian cargo
We fit a stereotype, that's what he said
Big long car, four big black heads
Cops keep jockin', grabbin' like 'gators
'Bout stereotypes, I'm lookin' nuthin' like Noriega
Cop took my wallet, looked at my license
His partner said ""Damn, they all look like Tyson""
Yes, I'm legit, so they gotta let me go
This bucket ain't rollin' in snow

It's my hooptie

Welcome into my Queendom (My Queendom)
Come one come all
When it comes to lyrics, I bring them (I bring them)
In spring I sing, in fall I call out to
All the ones who had a hard day
I prepared a place on my dance floor
The time is now for you to par-tay
I thought it would be a good chance for you to move
(One nation under a groove)
House music always soothes
So get with the flow, let's go, yo
Can you rock to a house groove tempo?
If so, then shall we let the games begin?
What better off position can you be in?
I'm on fire, the flame's too hot to douse
The pool is over, come into my house

[Chorus]
Don't make me wait
Come into my house (Give me body)
Don't make me wait
Come into my house (Give me body)

[Verse 2:]
Here's a dance step from Al and Kika
Bass and treble flow through the speakers
Ride the rhythm, I know it's gonna reach ya
I'm the queen, Latifah
Now it's time to run through it
45 King? (Yeah, baby?) Cue it
Yeah, there you go, I told you you could do it
Now did you enjoy it? (That was cool)
I knew it
Dance to the beat of the drum
Give me some
With the Flavor Unit I've come
To say ""ride the groove line""
Don't swing the pipe bomb
Listen to the smooth line
Throw away the white line
It's a house party I'm hosting (What?)
Come and rock with the one that's chosen
It can't turn me inside out (Uh uh)
For those who dare to, come into my house

[REPEAT Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
It's a new fusion I'm using
You ask what is it I'm doing?
Hip-hop house, hip-hop jazz, with a little pizzazz
From the queen, the Queen of Royal Badness
Remember me from ""Wrath of My Madness?""
It's my rap that rocks this party
I'm a hijack and jack your body
This is not an erotic interlude
Keep in mind I move multitudes
The Asiatic Black woman, hardcore beat drumming
It's hard to keep a good woman down, so I keep coming
Blow for blow, I take and I get some
Still I rise in a civilized wisdom
I hope the lyrical display has you around
It's an open invitation
Come into my house

Descending from the tribes of Africa
Inspired by the great black leaders

[ Professor X ]
Vanglorious
This is protected
By the Red, the Black and the Green
With a key
Zoom

(Dynamic
Articulate
Perceptive
Courageous
Outspoken)

[ VERSE 1: Brother J ]
One man is not a nation, Brother builds a Clan
Certer than the circle creates the better man
The colors, the brothers, the key, the motherland
This causes to assemble this blackman
Red, Black and Green are the colors of the flag on the rise
Cause a nation should be guised
Another flowing, as I comfort sons and daughters
Knowledge leads the way, so I flow like Nile's waters
African-American rebel of authority
Majority, while I'm so-called minority
Sometimes they ask me, ""Why are you the rebel?
Is that the way you choose, attain the bass and treble?""
Yup - ""Brother, don't get deep,"" that's what they tellin me
Just like a sell-out, while society
Gets stronger and stronger, my race gets weaker and weaker
Maybe I can make a difference through a mic and a speaker
So my lyrics flow different than a hip-hop be bop
Mic controller who turns out to be the flop
My wisdom God-given, excercised 'pon a rhythm
Power postive and strictly Bible, that's how I'm livin
Fortress we establish high, so none attack it
Back to the ways of our mathmatic blackness
They can't solve it, it's somethin they can't catch
Took respect off our lives, so now I'm snatchin it back
Power flows in the nation, there is life in the key
Let us all bind together in the Red, the Black, the Green

[ VERSE 2: Brother J ]
One vanglorious way, through the heart, unified
And that should be the guide
For the younger nation, so they can build the tribes
After and beyond keep the colors alive
A message through lyrics and beats composed
Bring composure outstanding direct to those
Who understand what was taken, xeroxed and stripped naked
Today's pig shall be tomorrow's bacon
Education brings false words, what do they teach?
Everything that I learned I had to self-reach
What do you know of a race that's dyin hourly?
The smartest men in the world, they in a bowery
Or either trapped or brain-washed on a come-up
Kicked to the butt, wake up, are you some kind of nut?
Are you blind, can't you see what's never seen?
We need some unity within the colors of the (Red, Black and Green)

[ VERSE 3: Brother J ]
Garvey-like brotherhood flows with the vibe
And with the key, the flag is kept alive
The sense of power, native to a different land
Originality, fact that I understand
A black fist, black power and a black man
X Clan take a stand with the other hand
Usin this as a gimmick, yo man, I'll catch you
Fetch you, kick my foot and then direct you
In the right path, succotash
Don't ask me 'bout the aftermath
You do what? Don't make me laugh
Dummy, I am protected by forces beyond you
Think before you step before the rebel, silly mortal, you
Wearin Mother's tags, and you don't know what they mean
All you are concerned with is greedy man's green
Sportin your medaillons, cause they matchin with your outfit
Your posse's wearin it, man, that's so illegit
Without definition you represent the fraudulent
Blessed with blackness, but now you're just doggin it
Tooth for tooth, and a man for man
Ignorance take a pause and we'll all understand
Independence is one thing when unity is stronger
No one to realize the pressure last longer
I'm just one man who fears for the worst
Cause if we don't take a stand someone will step first
And then...

Ice Cube with The Lench Mob, I got it goin on
A nigga that's livin in the city of the criminal zone
One-time can't keep the law in order
Cos everybody's goin crazy for a quarter
You're tuned in to the number one crew in the area
The way I'm talkin I'm scarin ya
I'm darin ya to raise hell and bail and brag and sag
Or beat down for ya flag
Cos if you is or you ain't a gangbanger
Keep one in the chamber
Cos you'll get them thangs put on ya son
Ice Cube has got the 4-1-1
All the ol' school house fellows are crooks
So I get jealous looks
They keep thinkin did my head grow?
Will the boys 'n' the hood have to beat down Ice Cube?
Hell no, I'll static son, you'll see it's okay
I keep my 9 anyway
For the day one of my homies wanna squab

Back in the day I did my share of dirt
Sometimes I got away clean, sometimes people got hurt
But if you know me, you know that I'm liable
To bust a cap cos it's all about survival of the fittest
I'm a menace crook
I did so much dirt I need to be in the Guinness Book
From the shit I took from people
I repo your Vette, then jet
Back to the criminal set
I leave clue after clue but they can't catch me yet
Cos I'm slick as slippery
They can't get wit me, cops ain't shit to me
I can't dig a pig so I drop the dogs
And sweat em like sweathogs
And get mad, mad cos I'm the nigga that flaunt it

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Aiyo, here's what the poster read:
'Ice Cube is wanted dead'
That's all it said
I put heads to bed and fled the scene wit all the green
Hear shots and si-reens
When I fiend first they yo' rings, now they my rings
So give it up punk and then I just
Put another jack in progress
It's the American way
Cos I'm the G-A-N-G-S-T-A
Ice Cube - a motherfuckin klepto
And tried to catch the early bird but they slept, so
Who gets the worm?
And if I'm caught in a trap
You know I'mma beat the wack
With a payoff, cop gotta lay off
FBI on my dick, stay off!
I'm not a rebel or a renegade on a quest
I'm a nigga with a 'S' on his chest
So get the Kryptonite cos I'm a rip tonight
Cos I'm scarin ya, wanted by America

[Verse 4: Ice Cube]
Word, but who the fuck is Herb?
It's time to take a trip to the suburbs
Let em see a nigga invasion
Point blank on a caucasian
Cocked the hammer didn't crack no smile
Take me to your house, pal
Got to the house, my pockets got fat, see
Crack the safe, got the money and the jewellry
Three weeks later, I'm at the P-A-D
Had a little fly ass bitch wit me
Sittin in the den, yo it couldn't be
(Whattup G?) Saw my face on TV
Damn (oh shit!) I didn't know I lucked out
Struck out, I gotta get the fuck out
Packed my bags and tried to hit the door when
The ol' bitch down the street must've turned me in
Cos the feds was out there ten deep
I got hassled and gaffled in the back seat
I think back when I was robbin my own kind
The police didn't pay it no mind
But when I start robbin the white folks
Now I'm in the pen wit the soap-on-a-rope
I said it before and I'll still taught it
Every motherfucker with a colour is most wanted

My, my, my my
Music hits me so hard
Makes me say ""Oh my Lord""
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hype feet
It feels good, when you know you're down
A super dope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

I told you homeboy (You can't touch this)
Yeah, that's how we living and you know (You can't touch this)
Look at my eyes, man (You can't touch this)
Yo, let me bust the funky lyrics (You can't touch this)

[Verse 2]
Fresh new kicks, and pants
You gotta like that, now you know you wanna dance
So move, outta your seat
And get a fly girl and catch this beat
While it's rolling, hold on
Pump a little bit and let 'em know it's going on
Like that, like that
Cold on a mission so fall on back
Let 'em know, that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

Why you standing there, man? (You can't touch this)
Yo, sound the bell, school is in, sucka (You can't touch this)

Give me a song, or rhythm
Make 'em sweat, that's what I'm giving 'em
Now, they know
You talking about the Hammer you're talking 'bout a show
That's hype, and tight
Singers are sweating so pass them a wipe
Or a tape, to learn
What's it gonna take in the 90's to burn
The charts? Legit
Either work hard or you might as well quit

That's word because you know (You can't touch this)

Stop!

Go with the flow, it is said
That if you can't groove to this then you probably are dead
So wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves, run your fingers through your hair
This is it, for a winner
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Move, slide your rump
Just for a minute let's all do the bump

Yeah (You can’t touch this)
Look, man (You can’t touch this)
You better get hype, boy, because you know you can’t (You can’t touch this)

The Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor and I'm magic on the mic
Now why would I ever stop doing this?
With others making records that just don't hit
I've toured around the world, from London to the Bay

Jump up, freak a hustle
Do what you want but move every muscle
Ain't no time for playing around
Only one thing to do when you hear this sound
Act yourself with someone else
And make sure yourself ain't by yourself

Dyin' to get on the dance floor
Girl what you waiting for?
Come on over and swing with me
Take your mind out yo' misery
Tomorrow's gonna be another day
Tonight, I'm gonna take it- life
Grab the world and put it on hold
Relax my body and rest my soul
Feel the vibe surrounding me
Feel the bass come down on me

Shake your butt but don't break your back
Tap your feet and let your fingers snap
No matter what size shape or colour
We can jam and enjoy each other
Music's pumpin' I feel something
Must be my blood and h! eartbeat thumpin
Dispense your funds to pass through the door
You know there's room for you on the floor
(You don't know if they'll be any more)
So yo, what you waiting for?

""Waiting the timeless time""

Yeah, yeah, some playin' a wall
I wasn't with that, not livin' like that
You ain't with it let me hear you say ho
You ain't with it let me hear you say aaaaoooo (aaaooo)
Ready to boogie I had on my dancin' shoes
Ain't in the mood to be singing no blues
So if you want to be a little disco ducka
I came here tonight to
So good morning, good afternoon, good night
Don't let the bedbugs bite
Going way out when I'm aiming to please
You havin' a good time, climb up my trees
C'mon what you waiting for?
C'MON what you waiting for?

""Waiting the timeless time""

Side to side, and just let it ride
Give what you got, no need to hide
You're allowed as long as your able
Take away the chairs and move away the tables
I'm doing my thing working around you
Ladies screaming (We wanna house you!)
We won't say much on this no now
Cause I'm not quite sure that you know how
But keep on dancin', (Keep on dancing!)
Baby on not clockin' you, I'm just glancin'
And what I see now is a fine figure-8
(Don't Make me Wait)

Yeah waiting for the DJ to play my song
O Lord, I must have waited all night long!
The joint was packed and it looked like a jungle
I felt at home, there goes my song
S! o I hit the floor and jumped on the case
Sweat pouring from my face
Clothes was wet by I didn't care
You know what I'm saying (I know what you're sayin')

So come on girl come on girl come on
Let's Let's Let's Get it on
I'm dyin' to get out on the floor
I waited long enough; I can't wait no more!
Come on girl come on girl come on

Verse 1:
I'm the arsenal, I got artillery, lyrics of ammo
Rounds of rhythm,then I'mm'a give 'em piano
Bring a bullet-proof vest, nothin' to ricochet
Ready to aim at the brain, now what the trigger say
Tempos triflin', felt like a rifle, massage 'n' melodies
Might go right through simultaneously, like an Uzi
Nothin' can bruise me, lyrics let up, when lady say don't lose me
So re-load quickly, and you better hit me
While I'm lettin' this fifi, get wit me
You steppin' with double-zero-seven (.007),better make it snappy
No time to do your hair baby, brothers are bustin' at me
Beats and bullets pass me, none on target
They want the R hit, but watch the God get -
Quicker, the tongue is the trigger, cause I'm real fast
Let off some rhythm at 'em, let 'em feel the blast
Penetrate at a crazy rate, this ain't no thirty-eight (.38)
Hit 'em at point blank range, and watch 'em radiate
Runnin' out of ammunition, I'm done wit' em
You ask me how I did 'em, I let the rhythm hit 'em


Reprise:
Let it hit 'em

Verse 2:
I push a power that's punishable, prepare to be a prisoner
The hit man is the, brother wit' charisma
Showing you that I have, powerful paragraphs
Followers become leaders, nut without a path
Ya mentally paralyzed, crippled ya third eye
Rhymes are blurred, then it occurred that you heard I -
Reduced the friction, with crucifixion
Let loose the mix then, boost the piston
Eric hit 'em with' some of that cut, like a lumberjack
And me gettin' hit back, it won't be none of that
I'm untouchable, you see me in three-D (3-D)
When I let the rhythm, hit another emcee
Lyrics made of lead, enters your head
Then eruptions of a mass production, will spread
When music is louder, full of gunpowder
Microphone machinery, when I see a crowd of -
Party people, pumpin' their fist like this
Ya hide in the back, thinkin' that I might miss
But the R is accurate,plus I'm packed up with
Educated punch lines that I have to hit
Whatever I aim at,I line 'em up
Ya body is weak, feel with pain, that time is up
You been hit with somethin' different, isn't it?
Rakim is gonna radiate and nothing's equivalent
Nothin' can harm me, why try to bar me?
You couldn't fuck around THE RA, with an army
You'll get wrecked by the architect, so respect him
I disconnect 'em, soon as I inject 'em, with radiation
Put 'em by the basement, bust his chest open
Bash his face in, let it split  him
Since he brought his main man wit' him
He ask me how I did 'em, I let the rhythm hit 'em

Reprise:
Let it hit 'em

Verse 3:
Dance floor's dangerous, packed in like a briefcase
Rhythm with real rough rhyme, beats with deep bass
Girls with tight pants, maybe they might dance
Tonight if the R's on the mic, there's a slight chance
The crowd is crucial, emcee grounds are neutral
Now that you're here, let me introduce you
Get ready, I'm hard to read, like graffiti
But steady, science I drop is real heavy
Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail, on the pain of remedy
The prescription's one every hour, now it's a HABIT
Ya need another hit, from the freestyle fanatic
Attention: follow directions, real close
Keep out of reach of children, beware of overdose
Too many milligram, NO ONE made an iller jam
My rhyme, is the rhythm of thoughts that kill a man
Ideas for the ear to fear, might split him
He'll never forget 'em, he'll rest in peace wit' 'em
At least when he left, he'll know what hit him
The last breath of the words of death, was the rhythm

Reprise:
Let it hit 'em (x4)

Verse 4:
Now throw you hands in the air and yo, go
Rakim will do the rest of this slow
If I speed they know, you'll blow the hell up
If I slow up they'll catch up, hell no
Wicked as I kicked it, don't need to remix it
Cause I prefixed it, reversed and switched it
To perform to perfection, section for section
Rhymes keep connectin', ya guessin' what's next and
Blood pressure rises, ya damn near lost it
Ya hit the ground burnin', and woke up frostbit
Cause when I explained, ya can't complain for pain
Travel through the brain, hit a vein, then remain
Let it radiate, vibes will vibrate, why did you violate?
Now I'm'ma have to let the style break
Moans now, the tone is ingrown
After this here's thrown, gimme another microphone
Before I get that, fifi I met
Whisper,"" I wanna reach her intellect""
Kiss her, cause I wanna give her the most respect
So I shine and let the write reflect
Hold her, mold her, make her feel older
Lay her on my shoulder, everything I told her
Makes her feel secure, whenever I'm wit' her
And you know how I did her, me and the rhythm hit her

But I tell ya straight up porque Rodi me di de cuenta
That on main street her cuerpo estaba a la venta
Now get some me que quiera
Get some cualquiera
Hey, yo, she don't care man
She's a tremenda fiera
Yeah you're hot to trot and out to get what I got
Pero ya que te conozco what I gots I guess not
(Porque?)
Cause you’re just a mentirosa con tu lengua venenosa
Today you tell me something, y mañana es otra cosa

[Dialogue]
Girl, I can't believe it
You know, my mother's talking about me
M- my friends are talking about me…not me about you.""
(About me?)
You're nothing but a skeezer
(A skeezer? Don't be calling me no skeezer!)
Tú tienes mucho flojera mami. Sí, uh-huh, la verdad
(Uh-huh, eso es lo que tu te crees)
I bet you go to church and you're scared to confess
(No, I do confess baby, I do confess)
Uh-huh, do you tell the truth, though?
(Yeah I do)
Yeah, right
(Do you?)
Yeah! You're nothing but a skeezer. You know what?
I got some other stories to say about you
It goes like this

[Verse 3]
Un día estaba en tu casa y ring there goes the phone
Recogiste y dijiste
(Call me back. I'm not alone)
El quería tu dirección, yeah just your address
Y antes que colgaste I heard you say
(I'll wear a dress)
Alabao que descarada is what ran through my mind
So I say, “Let’s go out tonight."" She said
(We go out all time)
Alabao, man!
Ella no sabía that, yo, I knew her plan
De que iba a salir with that other man
So I told the girl in Spanish, I said ""Hey, ya me voy.""
(Pero por qué?)
Cause you ain't treating me like I'm some sucker toy
Cause who needs you anyways
(I need you!)
Con tu lengua venenosa
(No te vayas, Mellow! No te vayas! Yo te necesito!)
Today you tell me something y mañana es otra cosa
(Tsk! But?!)
Mentirosa!

(Chorus: Scratched by DJ Unknown)
Tired of the mother fucking jackin'
Boys that be jackin
Tired of the motherfucking jackin'
Police, wanna front; wanna jack

On a day at the spot where the homies be chillin'
Gossiping about the latest Compton killin'
Brothers is deep, and no time to sleep
The Boys on the tip, and they trying to creep
Had a G-ride, so I suggest that we punch it
Grover was driving, and doing about a hundred
Hit a corner on the plata. Checked the spot
Seen the P.D. lights, down the spot was hot
Ed Dog was cuffin'. Threw in the back
Chiste and Lil' Rock jacked for selling that crack
E, man, hit the fence, yelled out, ""See you later!""
Shark then pulled out the big blue blazer
Dookie and Boo didn't know what to do
Jumped in the car with D.T, bumpin' CMW
Hit a U around the corner, did it work? I wonder
C.P.D. on my ass, and they burnin' rubber
Didn't want to be like brother and fly locked up
So I downed the bourb' that was still in my cup
Parked the G-ride, and I started to bail
Cause my trip was to home, not the County Jail
Police swooped by the time the Boys was near me
Go Go fled cause the homie was kind of leery
I wasn't sweating shit, cause they had nothing on me
Bam looked bad, gave a name that was phony
They peeped out the pager, said, ""How much did it cost?
By the way, MC Eiht, where's the dope you tossed?""
""Me sell dope? Officer, I'm a rap singer
Won't go down like the Compton gangbanger.""
They ran a warrant check, I must have had good luck
But the homie who ran? Mmmm
One Time gaffled him up

(Chorus 3x: Scratched by DJ Unknown)
Get your ass in the car
Ho hold it now
Keep still boy. No need for static

Get your ass in the car
You're coming with us!

(Verse 2):
Had a show to do on a Thursday night
Me, Chill, Slip, and Tom rolling in Big White
Loaded as fuck, bumping ""The Cactus.""
I hope the Stoney Boys don't try to jack us
Gas tank was loaded, and so was the E
Kind of buzzed of the sack of the good E.T
Chill was bustin' raps about the good ol' days
Switching to another form about how he get paid
Just then the Boys came behind the truck
Tom looked out and said, ""What the fuck?!?!""
A motorcycle cop riding hard on the tip
Had to clown his ass once, and said, ""This ain't no C.H.I.P.s!""
Homie had a warrant for a D.U.I
And in my pocket was a fat sack of Chocolate Thai
Damn! (damn)
Now it's time to get nervous
Starey Clown caught back em
And they was fixing to serve us
Dumb Dumb walked up and started asking for names
They he peeped me out and asked what's the gang I claim
The fact that I'm black is the reason you jack me
I've got to gang bang cause of the hat and khaki's
If I was in the hood, the dummy wouldn't have found me
He said, ""Shut the fuck up 'fore you're headed for the County!""
He was already late. The fools had they nerves
To have us sitting contest on the edge of the curb
Twas showt, shorter that showt. What can I say?
""Keep on talking. Go ahead. Make my day
He started to acting tough n' Chill thought he was bluffin
But in a second or two, the Boys started the cuffin
Bud in our pockets. Brew in our cups
No time for explanations. One Time gaffled us up

(Chorus 3x: Scratched by DJ Unknown)
Get your ass in the car
Ho hold it now
For when? For what?
I ain't guilty!

Get your ass in the car
You're coming with us!

100,845,The West Coast Rap All-Stars,We're All In The Same Gang,21,1990-06-23,"

[Intro]
Gun is Cocked and Fired
I'm King News and I come to you with the truth
The mean streets took six more lives overnight
All the result of gang-bang stupidity
By the way, you gangsters should know
One of your victims was a three year old girl
Well, you gang members, you still don't get it, do ya?

(With your badself)

[Verse 1: King Tee]
It's straight up madness everywhere I look
Used to be a straight a student, now he's a crook
Robbing people just to smoke or shoot up
Used to have a crew cut, now he's a pooh-butt
Dropped out of school and he joins the neighborhood gang
Hanging on the streets selling 'caine
To his own people
Now when I say people I mean color
You a stupid mother-
I'm trying to stress the fact that you're dumb
Get yourself presentable, son, and just come
Together, you better, cause pretty soon it's gonna be too late
A message from King Tee The Great

[Verse 2: Body & Soul]
Sisters, since we are the mothers of this earth
It's time we start being good mothers from the birth
Of our children, no time for sleeping
Teach them to fight and win for the right reason
It's your time, it's your life, live it
Proud to be black, young and gifted
Lifted by the knowledge and taking the right route
Gang violence needs to be wiped out
A-L-M-I-G-H-Ty and E-Z-I-R-E
We see the F-U-T-U-R-E
Should be a positive thing
Body & Soul and you, we're in the same gang

[Verse 3: Def Jef]
One and the same
Everyone came in the same chains
Caught with the same aim
Brain games and names changed
To protect the innocent by-stander
Lies, slander and the master-planner
Destroy the black male
Crack jail and semi-automatic
For static if the crack fails
So since we all talk the same slang
Stop killin, my brother, cause we're all from the same gang

[Michel'le]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Make the change cause we're all in the same gang

[Verse 4: Tone-Loc]
Now as a youth I used to get my bang on
And on the ave get my part-time slang on
Doing time for me was no joke though
They knew I was crazy, so they labelled me Loco
Khakis creased, golf hat, feelin sporty
Low ridin and tossin up a forty
Thinkin in my mind that no one could handle us
The downest brothers ever touched Los Angeles
I found life was much more suitable
Cause I'm the brother that makes black so beautiful
I ain't slippin or down with a head trip
I'm talkin to all the Bloods and all the Crips
Throw down your rag and get on the right track, man
It's time to fight, unite and be a black man
Tone-Loc is on a positive change
Cause remember, we're all in the same gang

[Verse 5: Above The Law]
Bein' the pimps that we are
We're here to speak on a situation that has gone too far
Here at home in the ghettos of LA
Where a young black brother's not promised to see the next day
Cause we used to clock on the streets before we made beats
But fools just lay and prey on the weak
It don't depend on the color of a rag
Cause if you got what they want you know they gonna take what you have
Cause violence don't only revolve from drugs and thugs
And gangs that bang
Most times it's a political thang
Yeah, a couple of spots'll get popped
And if the government wanted to freeze it it could all get stopped
But they don't because they want it like that
Because the system been set up to hold us back
Yeah, Above The Law means that we can do whatever
So why don't we stick together?
(You got it)

[Verse 6: Ice-T]
Ice-T rippin the microphone the way I do
Listen close, my brothers, cause I'm talkin to you
The problem is we got a suicidal lifestyle
Cause 90 percent of us are livin foul and wild
I say job, you say ([Hen-G:] bad joke
I rather jack another brother, watch the gun smoke)
Livin in the fast lane flippin like you're insane
You won't stop until your blood runs down the street drain
I got an idea, give me a minute
And if it makes sense, then get with it
What if we could take our enemies, feed em poison
Undereducate their girls and boys and
Split em up, make em fight one another
Better yet, make em kill for a color
All my brothers need to know one thing
No matter what you think, we're all in the same gang

[Michel'le]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Stop the fighting
(Make the change)
Because we're all in the same gang

[Verse 7: Dr. Dre and MC Ren]
Yo, we're not here to preach because we're not ministers
We're telling like it is cause Ren and Dre is like sinister
Reality speaks for itself when it's spoken
A basehead cluck can't blame nobody for smoking
Yo, bullets flying, mothers crying, brothers dying
Lying in the streets, that's why we're trying
To stop it from falling apart and going to waste
And keeping a smile off of white face
N.W.A never preaching, just teaching
The knowledge of the streets to each and
All that don't understand, that's why we came
To let you know that we're all in the same gang

[JJ Fad]
The J double, F, the a, the d, that is
And if you want the solution to the quiz
What's black and black, yo, and kills another?
An ignorant sucker that isn't labelled as a brother
But another
So now it's time we evolve
And get together and solve it
Cause the world is revolvin
Around a terrible situation
One will kill another for a reputation
So it's time we stop and realize that we're all the same
Yo Train, tell em (We're all in the same gang)

[Young MC]
Brothers killin' other brothers
I thought the idea was to love one another?
Open up the paper to one more death
If y'all keep this up then there'll be no one left
I try my best to set an example
Sayin hype lyrics over hip-hop samples
Not just a brag or to boast but to inform
Cause we're livin in the calm before the storm
You see, I believe that the children are the future
But what's it all about if in the future they shoot ya?
We're all human beings, if we're cut we'll bleed
And I want to see all young people succeed
Do 9 to 5, not 5 to 10
Just go to work and not the state pen
Cause you live better when you're out there free
And that's comin straight to ya from the Young MC

[Digital Underground]
I'm in a rage
Oh yeah? Yo, why is that G?
Other races, they say we act like rats in a cage
I tried to argue, but check it, every night in the news
We prove them suckers right and I got the blues
America
Get busy, Humpty
The red, the white, the blue and
The blue and the red
For Crips and Bloods
The white for who's got you doin
Time bustin caps on one another
The Underground's down for peace among brothers
Kill a black man?
What?
Yo, what are you retarded?
Tell em, Hump
Yo, do you work for the Klan?
Do what ya like
Unless you like gangbangin
Let's see how many brothers leave us hangin

[Oaktown's 3.5.7.]
The gang that should hang is the one that contains
The sisters and the brothers who are all in the same frame of mind
Now listen, get loose, it's unity time
Yeah, yeah
Peace is a presence that we all need
The future's in our hands, in word and deed
I'm Terrible T and I'm Sweet LD
We're 3.5.7. totally

[MC Hammer]
Kickin on the ave 'bout a quarter to 9
All the homies gettin blind in an eight ball line
Now on this tip they started runnin at the lip
Jumped in their deuce and took a little trip
Hit the block about 12 on the tick
The windows went down and the nines went click
People started yellin, bodies started bailin
Bullets cold flyin sendin some to hell and
It's gotta stop, we don't need all the violence
Peace in the hood and a moment of silence
We got together not for ego or fame
We got involved cause we're all in the same gang

[Eazy-E]
Last but not least, yo, Eazy's no sell-out
And if you can't hang in the streets, then get the hell out
I'm not tryin to tell ya what to do
You have your own freedom of choice who to listen to
You knew good from bad, fair from foul, right from wrong
Now your mother's singing that sad song
(My baby ain't never hurt nobody!)
But he still got smoked at BeBe's party
But you're not the first or the last
You're nothin but a short story from the past
You're dead now, not number one but a zero
Take notes from Eazy-E, the violent hero

[Michel'le]
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?
Don't you know we've got to put our heads together?

(Fun- fun- funky)
(Got to be funky)
(Funky!)
(Funky enough)

[Verse 1: Kool Moe Dee]

Look, look, look, look, look, look, look...
Look at me, cool as I wanna be
Fly as they come, Messiah to some, born to be
One of the chosen few, chosen to go into
Rhymes that change in time, as it grows into
Riches, hits and switches your whole lifestyle
You're in the spotlight, overnight flight miles
Away, today I'm flying high
So I give thanks to the Man in the sky
I remember a time whenever a rhyme
Left your lips, it only could get nickels and dimes
But nickels and dimes wasn't enough to eat
So I guess you could say I was saved by the beat
On the street, surrounded by sin
I never sell out, and I wouldn't give in
God said, ""you can win, look within
See your skin, you're my kin
And I made you Funke""

[Hook]
(Is it funky enough?)
(I like it)
God made me funke
(Is it funky enough?)
(I like it)
God made me funke
F-U-N-K-E

[Verse 2: Kool Moe Dee]

Esoteric, non-generic, potent lyrics
Only those with ears will hear it
As above, so below
Lucky seven, seventh heaven, heaven flow
Back and forth
South to north
Right to left
Life to death
East to west
Knowledge step, thirty three degrees
Three hundred and twenty seven left to see
So God created a light in which I shine
With sublime rhymes that inclines the mind
To find ancient secrets, seek it, speak it, teach it
Keep it, peep it, we get stronger and reap its
Benefits, but then it gets more intricate
As you get deeper into it
To open the door, the power of God's the one key
And I opened it, and God made me funke

[Hook]

[Bridge: Kool Moe Dee]

(Funky) is the way God made me
(Funky) is the power He gave me
(Funky) like the fans that pay me
(Funky) like the stations that play me
(Funky) is how I made it through the '80s
(Funky) connected to the ladies
(Funky) you know a devil can't faze me
(Funky) I ain't afraid, B
(Funky) cause God made me
Funke

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kool Moe Dee]

I'm over, over like a fat rat
The blind see what I got, and others see how I got that
Position with vision
Precision, decision's like a livin' prism
I'm shining light on the money I made
And the rhymes parlayed
And you can see I'm paid
I condemn them that focus on the ends
As opposed to the means, killing machines, men
I'm the real high roller, cause I'm rolling with God
Save the children, that's my job
Working overtime, going over rhyme
Mind over matter, spirit over mind
I sympathize with the brothers on the street
Cause it's genocide, and we all got to eat
But do the right thing, and you'll never be hungry
I kept the faith and God made me funke

[Intro]
DRUGZ:  Yo Debonaire, there's that girl you tried to talk to!
DEB:  Word!
DRUGZ:  Hey yo, baby, c'mere, yo, why you tryin' to front on my man
Debonaire?
ANGIE:  Debonaire?
DRUGZ:  Yeah
ANGIE:  Uh-uh.  All the girls tell me that he's no good
DRUGZ:  Oh, aaight, I ain't gon' argue, but yo, wussup with me?  My name is
Drugz!
ANGIE:  Look, all you Poison Clan brothers are no good

[Verse 1:  Debonaire]
Debonaire's bad and so I'm called the Devil's Dad
I kick the funky stuff because I'm rough, and I'ma add
That, girls, I cold leave 'em, I totally deceive 'em
I soothe and then relieve 'em, and then you best believe I'm
Audi 5000, and I find another bitty
They tell me it's a pity, I want to get the whole city
Girl, so don't you be shocked, you best to get set
Women say I'm sick, but ask me have I seen a vet yet?
Naw, I just keep on, I keep ho-in'
I keep goin' nowhere and, I can't stop and so in
About a two year period I think I'll put Jim in
Wait up, lemme see, well, about a hunderd women
(Damn!)  Because of that, lots of women wanna hate ya
But I'm sayin', yo, it's in my nature!

[Hook:  Angie Griffin]
According to the Poison Clan, you can never trust a man
I know a man would fool around, but I still can't understand

[Verse 2:  JT Money]
Lovin' and leavin', that's what I believe in
Yo!  I only think about me when I'm skeezin'
So, women get mad and call me everything from A to Z
But I don't care, cause you know, I'm the J to T
To the dollar sign, and you will hardly find
Another brother with a pipe game as good as mine
So I flaunt the gift that I was given
And don't ask because you know how I'm livin'
(True.) Bein' in love's for the birds; I ain't a pigeon
They say love is blind; I got 20/20 vision
(Word.)  So if you don't want your feelings hurt
Don't be on my back like you a Poison Clan t-shirt
And when I tell you these things, it's not to make you
Mad at me, but you should know it's in my nature

[Hook]

[Verse 3:  Debonaire]
Women crowd around and say, ""Look how insane he acts!""
When they need to check out Drugz and Uzi, man, they're maniacs
It's facts that I'm kickin', so girl, ain't nothin' made up
I'm talkin' on a straight-up
But still you're sayin' to hold up and wait up
You think I'm lyin', while talkin' of my nature then
It's not my fault that all the women wanna hate ya when
People can't help it, they shouldn't wanna hate ya
But they think it's voluntary, not just in my nature

DRUGZ:  Yo, now you see what I'm sayin'?
Yo, Debonaire and JT, they ain't got  no flavor, but I'm versatille!
ANGIE:  Uh-uh, cause y'all run the same ol' game, day after day
DRUGZ:  Oh, naw, not me, baby, I'm different!
ANGIE:  Look, birds of a feather flock together
DRUGZ:  Hey yo, my name is Drugz, and I change up like the weather!

[Hook]

[Verse 4:  JT Money]
People say the things I do to women make 'em rowdy
Lie to get down, bang the boots, then I'm Audi
5 on a mission, see I'm not dissin'
As long as there's fish in the sea, I'll be fishin'
Cause one's not enough; I ain't a wimp, I'm a pimp
And uh, I ain't lonely for no relationships!
You wanna be the girl that I hate?  I ain't frontin'
Cause this ain't The A-Team, slim, You Gets Nothin'
No money, no clothes, or a lil' kiss
None of that unless you like gettin' dissed!
I act this way, not because I hate ya
But you should know, it's in my nature

[Intro: D Nice (Sample)]
(My name is D Nice, my name is D Nice
My name, my name is D Nice
My name is D Nice
Taking out you suckers and you don't know how I did it)
Yo, this is D-Nice and I'm about to drop some funky lyrics on this track I made up, you know what I'm saying, huh, yea and you don't stop, yo

[Verse 1: D Nice]
My name is D-Nice although I hate to admit it
Taking out you suckers and you don't know how I did it
See every episode remains in this mode
Very cool, very calm, there's no sweat in my palm
I just pick up the mic, proceed with a song
I get right to the point, my competition's not long or short
It's like a sport hanging in the middle
But now if you're puzzled, let me kick the whole riddle
That my name is Derrick and if I didn't mention
D-Nice is just a description
It describes the kid on the mic
I'm the TR-808, huh, but just call me D-Nice

[Chorus]
My name is D Nice
Take, ta-take, taking out you suckers and you don't know how I did it

[Verse 2: D Nice]
I start to think, a very big conscious all around me
Who will be the sucker MC to try to doubt me
Is it you, or you, or you, or you, or him
But I'm like a tree and every lyric is a limb
You throw it on the turntable, very unstable
But you gamble because you need that example
There's a 1000 MC's on the planet earth now
What is the word you say to get hers
Some like to explain, some talk educated
Some like McBoo, he's X-rated
I like to think of myself as a pure rebel
A radical thinker on a musical level
Cause suckers want to stop me and girls want to kiss
Wherever I go, yo, it seems I can't be dissed
Cause my name is D-Nice but all the girls call me Derrick
It ran through my crew so I guess I've inherit
The job of explaining and also retaining
The fact D-Nice is remaining
Not a king nor a prince but as a teacher
With dope beats like this, I know I'm gonna reach ya
So now I don't think you should all despise
This fact D-Nice is on a rise
Straight to the top like a bubble of water
It's a slaughter so I think you oughta
Think realistically, not egotistically
It's suicide if you even think of dissing me
Cause if you try, I'm a make you wait
To learn the reason I'm the 808, but just call me D-Nice

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: D Nice]
I live in the Bronx by the D and the 4
Writing lyrics, it's addictive, writing more and more and more
About peace, about wars, about whores
Breaking city laws to me become a chore
I wear no jeri curls but I still pull girls
I don't slur my words when I rap cause that's wack, huh
But in fact, I do not slack
When I drop the funky, funky lyric on a track
I'm not conceited when I walk the streets
And you can tell by the words that I speak
That I'm not just another brother on the mic
Cause the females love me and they call me D-Nice

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Kid Frost]
Q-Vo, aqui estoy, MC Kid Frost
Yo soy jefe, maton, yes the Big Boss
My cuete's loaded, it's full of balas
I put it in your face and you won't say nada
Vatos, cholos, you call us what you will
You say we are assassins an we are sent to kill
It's in my blood to be an Aztec Warrior
Go to any extreme and hold no barriers
Chicano and I'm Brown and I'm proud
Guantes, chingazos, simon ese, let's get down
Right now, in the dirt
What's the matter? You afraid you're gonna get hurt?
I'm with my homeboys, my camaradas
Kicking back con mi ganga, y para mi no vale nada
Yo soy chingon ese, like Al Capone ese
Controlo a todos solo never try to sweat me
Some of you don't know what's happening que pasa
It's not for you anyway, cuz this is for the Raza

[Hook (x2)]
This for La Raza, Raza
This for La Raza, Raza

[Verse 2: Kid Frost]
The foreign tongue I’m speaking is known as calo
Y sabes que loco? Yo soy muy malo
Tu no sabes nada your brain is hollow
Been hit in the head too many times with the palo
Still you trying to act cool, but you should know
You're so cool that I'mma call you a culo
You're just a pee wee, you can't get it ever
You're a leva
Your own barrio doesn't back you up
They just look at your ass and call you a poo butt
And so I look and I laugh and say que pasa
Yeah, this is for the Raza

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 3: Kid Frost]
Cruising in the calle, headed for the bolo
No want to go with me, so I had to go solo
And when I go out alone I'm packed
I don’t sweat the chavalas when I know that I'm strapped
Every time that I pack my piece
I pull it out quick all the nonsense is ceased
Just like the song when you're 18 With A Bullet
Got my finger on a trigger, I'm not afraid to pull it
If it gets out of hand I know some mafiosos
Quick to pull out cuetes on some stupid ass baboso
Sitting there wondering what's happened, que pasa
Yeah, this is for the Raza

[Intro]
“The rhythm, the rebel”
“Don’t believe the hype!”
“Yes!”
“How low can you go?”
“Show ‘em we can do this!”
“Here we go again”

[Verse 1]
Uh, your bad self
Help us break this down from off the shelf
Here's a music servin' you so use it
Papa got a brand new funk
Kick that (party for your right)
Huh, let's get it on like we said before
They say the brothers causing trouble
Hate to bust their bubble
Cause we rumble from our lower level
To condition your condition, we're gonna do a song
That you never heard before
Make you all jump along to the education
Brothers gonna work it out
And stop chasing
Brothers, brothers gonna work it out

[Hook]
You got it...what it takes
Go get it...where you want it?
Go get it...get involved
Cause the brothers in the street are willing to work it out

[Verse 2]
So many of us in limbo
How to get it on, it's quite simple
Three stones from the sun
We need a piece of this rock
Our goal indestructible soul
Answers to this quizzing
To the Brothers in the street
Schools and the prisons
History shouldn't be a mystery
Our stories real history
Not his story
We gonna work it one day
Till we all get paid
The right way in full, no bull
Talking, no walking, driving, arriving in style
Tell 'em -- soon you'll see what I'm talking 'bout
Cause one day
The brothers gonna work it out
Brothers, brothers gonna work it out

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Let's get it on... we are willing
Let's get it on, let's get it on ... we are willing
Let's get it on, let's get it on, let's get it on ... we are willing

Now we are ready if you are ready
Yo, drop the rhyme in overtime, G

[Verse 3]
In 1995, you'll twist to this
As you raise your fist to the music
United we stand, yes divided we fall
Together we can stand tall
Brothers that try to work it out
They get mad, revolt, revise, realize
They're super bad
Small chance a smart brother's
Gonna be a victim of his own circumstance
Sabotaged, shell-shocked, rocked and ruled
Day in the life of a fool
Like I said before to live it low
Life take you time, time yo go slow
Look here, not a thing to fear
Brother to brother, not another as sincere
Teach a man how to be father
To never tell a woman he can't bother
You can't say you don't know
What I'm talking 'bout
But one day ... brothers gonna work it out

113,990,Father M.C.,Treat Them Like They Want To Be. . .,16,1990-08-04,"

Chorus
Treat 'em like they wanna be treated
You should treat 'em right
(Repeat 4x's)
Yeah, oh yeah
What you need to do...
You should treat them right
Oh, yeah

Why girls play with my feelings?
I don't know so that's why I ask
Maybe it's true that I set myself up
But then again it's the question I asked
I want someone for me who is straight
A kind of cutie. Yes, yep, a smart mate
I've been around searching for the right one
But it seems like a waste of my time
Every time that I meet the right 1
It seems as if she plays with my mind
So it makes me on the defense side
Because my offense is sort of slow
It doesn't pay to tell someone ""I love you""
Because in my vocab ""I love u"" is a no, no
I think I give in. My feelings, they show
I think I'd better not look back
I've been down a little too long
And now it's time that I get on track
So I must...

Chorus

I like to mingle when I do mingle
I love to mingle when I do flirt
I get off hand and tell the stories
About my past & that's when it hurts
But I need to find for me a lonesome lady type
Who wants me for self
A woman who wants me because of Father
Not for the fame or for my wealth
So I can ""Show her how I feel""
Yeah, ladies I'm not that picky
But being picky is just for self
I must protect what I respect
And that is me & not someone else
I've been mistreated up on the downhill
Back in the days I used to be strong
I used to flirt, hurt, kind of jerk
Get the cash, the sex then I'm gone
But payback is a mother
And now I don't know who to trust
So I just...

Chorus

Yeah, you know women? Yeah they tell me I'm lovely & cuddly but I just don't understand why they want to play with my feelings. But it won't happen again
Nah, never

(No, no no no no no...)

So listen ladies I'll treat you
How you treat me back in return
I'm not rude. No, I'm not stuck up
But my feelings are my main concern
So don't think that I'd give in
Cause now I know how to show
My feelings when I get involved
I'll take it slow before I say ""Oh, No""
I'll treat you like you treat me
I'll be straight loyal & all
So don't take advantage of Father
Because I'll step up but not crawl
So give me what you can give me
Love, attention, a lot of respect
I don't ask for a whole lot
But I'm gone if you wanna step
That's why I like to take it slow
Not rush because I want more
The next time that I fall in love
Hmm, you bets I'll be sure

(I'm gonna treat you...)
Chorus

So ladies... now y'all know how I'm living... & y'all know what I'm about. And that's the end. So if you feel you can commit, come & give it a shot

[Intro]
Yeah
(To da break of dawn)
All my sex involved
As we get funky
Rhymes so bizarre
Everybody knows
When it come to a situation like this
Little more effects
And I can't resist
So we get funky in the house
Youknowmsayin?
L.L. Cool J style
What?
This ain't on a pop tip
Check it out

[Verse 1]
What is a panther? A animal that kills
I'm like a shark with blood comin out the gills
You could never in your wildest dreams
Get a piece of this gangsta lean straight from Queens
Strong as liquor, to be seen in a limousine
Now you're gettin done without Vaseline
Wouldn't bite because your rhymes are puppy chow
Made another million, so competitors bow
Homeboy, hold on, my rhymes are so strong
Nothing could go wrong, so why do you prolong
Songs that ain't strong, brother, you're dead wrong
And got the nerve to have them Star Trek shades on
Ha, you can't handle the whole weight
Skin needs lotion, teeth need Colgate
Wise up, you little burnt up french fry
I'm that type of guy
And I slammed you know, just like a sumo
Put him in Pampers, leave my drawers in his hamper
When I'm through, you need a brand-new identity
I was scoopin girls before you lost your virginity
Your jam is just a dreamin MC scheme
Gettin crushed by a L.L. theme
Somethin like Shaft, put you in a cask' - bo!
You little blood-clot boy, you must not know
The rep I keep, the MC's I peep, sweep, play cheap
And freak with a chic unique technique
Get rid of the yukmouth smile
Cause brother, you ain't got no style

[Chorus]
Keep on
(To da break of dawn)
(To da break of dawn)
Yeah
Keep on
(To da break of dawn)
Hey yo, that's kinda funky
But check this out here
(Rock that shit)
(To da break of dawn)
Yeah...

[Verse 2 ]
Immaculate styles I use to abuse
MC's, so light the fuse
And spread the news, you lose
To the damager, microphone manager
Cold crush and bruise and bandage a amateur
That amateur swingin a hammer
From a body bag, so run and get your camera
Get a flick of the stiff dead-shot to get swift
But I'm the wrong brother to dance with
Cause I don't need a partner to swing
Keep your eyes on the Cool J ring
Shootin the gift, but you just don't shoot it right
You couldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
Wouldn't throw a rock in a ghost town
So don't try to play post, clown
You know the L.L.'s back in town
And all the wanna-be sherrifs is gettin shot down
Gimme that microphone
I'mma show you the real meaning of the danger zone
Stop dancin, get to walkin
Shut your old mouth when young folks is talkin
Huh, you little snake in the grass
You swing a hammer, but you couldn't break a glass
Gimme a lighter - woof!
Now you're cut loose
From that jherri curl juice
Cool J is back on the map
And when I see ya, I'mma give you a slap
That's right, a little kick for that crap
Cause my old gym teacher ain't supposed to rap

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
How dare you stand beside me
I'm Cool, I freeze I-c-e
On your trail and I'mma cut that bull tail
You're disobedient with the wrong ingredients
But I'mma drink you down over the rocks
While I freak on your album cover jocks
You're gonna hear a real ill paragraph soon
I took the cover right home to the bathroom
In the immortal words of L.L., 'hard as hell'
Your broad wears it well
She's the reason that your record sold a few copies
But your rhymes are sloppy
Like Oscar, and you're bound to get dropped
And stopped, I ain't Murray the cop
Nor am I Felix, but I got a bag of tricks
Mr. Pusherman, gimme a fix
So I can show you I'm immune to them romper room tunes
You little hip-hop racoon
I'm not Scarface, but I want more beef
Before you rapped you was a downtown car thief
Workin in a parking lot
A brother with a perm deserves to get burned
So tell me how you like your coat cream?
On a cone, in a bowl, or in a wet dream?
With your tv on channel fuzz
Uncle L, that's how much damage he does
Here's 5 dollars, catch a taxi cab
Take your rhymes around the corner to the rap rehab

Keep on
(To da break of dawn)
Yeah
(To da break of dawn)
I say keep on
(To da break of dawn)

Just wanted to funk it up a little bit
My man Pete Rock is up in the crib
Youknowmsayin
Over here at Marley Marl house
Just coolin out
My man Clash in the house
Sippin on this Bartles & Jaymes premium piece flavor out the cooler
Loungin back
Keep on
Peace

Song:   Weak at the Knees

I make you weak at the knee-eee-eee-eees!!
Ah come along, ah we gonna jam
Ah come along, ah won't me hold your hand, yaiiiiie
Ah come along, it'll be so nice

[E.S.T.]
I won't beat around the bush but come right up front
Miss Thang, you know you got sumtim I want
It ain't your daddy's money, I got my own flunkies
It's to get you all alone doin that funky
To play footsie and tickle your soul
Cause I can get sweeter than a tootsie roll
So good to it that you wanna leave never
But feel what's real always and forever
You want me for all the things I do
Workin to the phone for crazy you
Girl you inspire, me to perspire
Lost in the force of Earth Wind & Fire
Turn off the lights click on a slow tape
And I'ma show ya, just why they call me great
In a snowstorm baby it'll be a hundred degrees
Bakin ya, makin ya weak at the knees

Chorus:

I make ya weak at the knees
I make you feel all right, yeaaaaaaah
I make ya weak at the knees
I make you feel all right, yaaowwwww, so

[E.S.T.]
So don't tease me baby stop messin around
Make me get up so I can get on down
I wanna please you til it's almost unbearable
Fire and desire in me somethin terrible
I'm never done lazy
(I make you feel like you never had in your life, baaaaabe)
I don't know if you ready or not
Or how you will react if you're put on the spot
But I go for broke cause I ain't no joke
In the mix doin tricks never missin a stroke
If you were Hollywood then I would strive for fame
Untamed as I make you call out my name
Cause I'm the host with the most
Your head might hurt, from it steady hittin the bedpost
Think you wanted rhyme but I'm down to drop
And go the whole nine yards you hear, ""Baby don't stop!""
Tears for Fears, from beggin me please
Takin all you can stand til you're weak at the knees

Interlude:

Well I heard, that you were hard to satisfy momma
Well I heard, other men tried and weren't gettin none
Well I heard, that what they say about you's really true
But I heard, that you got a special rap from me too
Tell ya what momma

Chorus + (momma you hear me don't you hear me sing)

[E.S.T.]
You look tasty and baby I want a taste
So let the titties pour down upon my face
Back is arched and my muscles flex
I know you're all the way live, don't play Memorex
How could it be wrong, to love so right
Throughout the morning, evening, noon and night
Go for days in God's most precious creation
I ain't weak for freaks I'ma want temptation
Revealing, my Sexual Healing
And like Toyota, Oh What a Feeling
Out on the prowl won't make a peep
But get Knee Deep, now how's that for steep
Drench you more than the seven seas
I'm like a motor overheating pour your antifreeze
Comin at cha with three bachelor degrees
Certifying me for makin you weak at the knees

Chorus (with varations to moaning, then scatting afterwards)

117,998,M.C. Hammer,Have You Seen Her,24,1990-08-04,"

Ah yeah, I'm glad I put this tape in
I'm just gon' cruise down the road
Look at the stars in the sky
And drift off into the sweet memories that I have
Of a love that my heart has been searching for
For so long, and I know somewhere
If I keep searching, that love I'll find
The picture grows clearer and clearer
From the back to the front of my mind
And like love, a love I know I'll have
The girl that I want, she'll be mine, she'll be fly, and it'll last

I see her face and I can't let go
She's in my dreams and my heart, so let me know
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?

I'm looking for that love
She's a thought and a vision in my memory
I haven't met her, but tell me where could she be

Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
I'm looking for that special love

Love is a feeling that the Hammer definetly needs

Baby be mine

At the movies, in my car, on my stereo
At a game of Different World or the Cosby Show
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
Yo veo, tell me what's up
At the track, at the club, or out buying dub
If you've seen her, then I'll have her, cause I'm in love

Have you seen her?
(tell me have you seen her?)
My heart is hurting so bad
(love, oh love, love is a feeling that I need)
Love is a feeling that I know I need

Be mine baby
(I need your love to make it)
I need your love to make it
Why don't you be mine

At the store around the corner
Or wondering at night
Or chilling with another brother holding the mic
(have you seen her?)
Have you seen her?

Hammer, you know I'm looking
Calling all my friends all around the place
Guy, Lavertte, or my homey Rob Base

If you've peeped her out, tell me
Yo, veo on the phone
Ted, Dre, or Ed Lover
Fab Five, homeys won't you help a young brother

I can see yo' face
I'm seeing her face, again and again
Come knocking at my door, and you know I'll let you in

Oh, my sweet love
Searching 'round the world, what more can I say?

[Verse 1, KRS-One]
Im in junior high with a b plus grade
At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade
I walk from school to my moms apartment
I got to tell the suckas everyday ""don't start it""
Cause where I'm at if you're soft you're lost
To say on course means to roll with force
A boy named Rob is chillin in a Benz
In front of my building with the rest of his friends
I give him a pound, oh I mean I shake his hand
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man
I go upstair and hug my mother
Kiss my sister, and punch my brother
I sit down on my bed to watch some tv
(machine gun fire) do my ears decieve me
Nope, thats the fourth time this week
Another fast brother shot dead in the street
The very next day while im off to class
My moms goes to work cold busting her ass
My sisters cute but she got no gear
I got three pairs of pants and with my brother I share
See there in school see I'm made a fool
With one and a half pair of pant you ain't cool
But there's no dollars for nothing else
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf
Every day I see my mother struggling
Now its time i've got to do
Something
I look for work I get dissed like a jerk
I do odd jobs and come
Home like a slob
So here comes Rob his gold and chivalry
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery
I do it once, I do it twice
Now theres steak with the beans and rice
My mother's nervous but she knows the deal
My sister's gear now has sex appeal
My brothers my partner and we're getting paper
Three months later we run our own caper
My family's happy everything is new
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do

[Hook]
Thats why, (loves gonna get you)
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)
You fall in love with your chain
You fall in love with your car
Loves gonna sneak right up and snuff you from behind
So I want you to check the story out as we go down the line
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)

[Verse 2, KRS-One]
Money's flowing, everything is fine
Got myself an uzi and my brother a nine
Business is boomin' everything is cool
I pull about a g a week fuck school
A year goes by and I begin to grow
Not in height but juice and cash flow
I pick up my feet and begin to watch tv
Cause now I got other people working for me
I got a 55 inch television you know
And every once in awhile I hear just say no
Or the other commercial I love
Is when they say, this is your brain on drugs
I pick up my remote control and just turn
Cause with that bullshit im not concerned
See me and my brother jump in the BM
Driving around our territory again
I stop at the light like a superstar
And automatic weapons cold sprayed my car
I hit the accelerater scared as
Shit
And drove one block to find my brother was hit
He wasn't dead but the blood was pouring
And all I could think about was war and
Later I found that it was Rob and his crew
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do

[Hook]

[Verse 3, KRS-One]
My brothers out of it, but I'm still in it
On top of that im in it to win it
I can't believe that Rob would diss me
That faggot, that punk, he's soft a sissy
I'm driving around now with three of my guys
The war is on and I'm on the rise
We rolled right up to his favorite hang out
Said hello and then the bullets rang out
Some fired back so we took cover
And all I could think about was my brother
Rob jumped up and began to run
Busting shots hoping to hit someone
So I just stopped, and let off three shots
Two hit him and one hit a cop
I threw the gun down and began to shout
Come on I got him it's time to break out
But as we ran there were the boys in blue
Pointing their guns at my four man crew
They shot down one, they shot down
Two
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do

(Marley Marl sample: ""Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumping"")


Yeah aight
But we need a beat that they can front to
Oh, that'll work
Be funky
You know what I'm sayin?

(Cars ride by with the boomin systems)
(Cars ride by)

Funky
For all the cars out there
And all the brothers
That like to front in their rides
Check it out

You know it's funky, funky, funky cos you heard it from hearsay
A jam that you love that don't be gettin no airplay
Strictly for frontin when you're ridin around
12 o'clock at night with your windows down
Headlights breakin cos your batteries drain
Armor All on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin outside of all the hip-hop spots
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots
Leanin to the side, people everywhere
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
Cos they don't understand why I act this way
Pumpin up the funky beat until the break of day
It's because I want attention when I'm ridin by
And the girls be on my jock cos my system's fly

Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
Cos they be hear me gettin funky frequently
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this
...mind your business
...now pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin my head
While I'm checkin out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
I'm frontin, and I don't care if you know
The backseat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne?
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise—it's 3 o'clock
The girlies, they smile, they see me comin
I'm steady hummin, I got the Funky Drummer drumming
My trunk be shakin, vibratin and rattlin
Pumpin so loud, all the shorties be babblin
My right-hand man's here without the swing
Every chance I get I'm showin off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
Cos I'm frontin in my ride and my word is bond

Sun roof open, so I can feel the wind blow
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the O to the O to the L to the I to the N
To the F to the R to the O to the N to the T to the I to the N
That means I'm chillin
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back, so I can get real cozy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say: I want bass
I want a hit, I want a dose
You're rollin up smilin, but you can't come close
Cos my system is pumpin loud
Like Rakim said: I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE
Tell the cops: you gots to chill with EPMD
This is something devastatin that'll break your trunk
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk

You know what I'm sayin
Word
So next time you're in your ride pumpin it up
Just remember
It's Cool

Peace

128,1124,Kool G Rap & D.J. Polo,Streets Of New York,25,1990-09-08,"

[Verse 1]
In the streets of New York
Dope fiends are leaning for morphine
The tv screens follow the homicide scenes
You live here, you’re taking a chance
So look and I take one glance, there’s a man inside an ambulance
Crowds are getting louder, I wonder how the
People want to go fight for the white powder
People hanging in spots
They waited until the blocks got hot and got raided by the cops
I’ll explain the man sleeping in the rain
His whole life remains inside a bottle of Night Train
Another man got his clothes in a sack
Cause he spent every dime of his rent playing blackjack
And there’s the poor little sister, she has a little baby daughter
Named Sonya and Sonya has pneumonia
So why’s her mother in a club pulling zippers?
Yo that’s her job, Sonya’s mommy is a bar stripper
Drug dealers drive around looking hard
Knowing they’re sending their brothers and sisters to the graveyard
Every day is a main event, some old lady limps
The pushers and pimps eat shrimps
It gets tiring, the sound of a gun firing
Then there's desire for the sound of a siren
A bag lady dies in an alleyway
She’s seen the last of her days inside the subways
More and more down the slope, the kid couldn’t cope
So he stole somebody’s dope and a gold rope
Now my son’s on the run, he’s a wanted one
Who had fun then was done by a shotgun
Upstairs I cover my ears in tears
The man downstairs must have drank too many beers
Cause every day of his life he beats his wife
Till one night she decides to pull a butcher knife
Blind man plays the sax
A tune called “The Arms on My Moms Show Railroad Tracks""
Many lives are cut short
That’s when you’re living, in the streets of New York

[Break]

[Verse 2]
Baby needs new shoes
But his papa uses all the money for booze
A young girl is undressed in the back seat of a caddy
Calling some man daddy
Three men slain inside an apartment
All you could see was the sparks when it darkened
Daylight broke, cops roll on the scene
The drug war, daily routine
Gambling spots, just a poor man’s jackpot
You winning a lot, you get shot
The drug dealing fanatics, but you don’t want no static
Cause they got crack addicts with automatics
Shoot-outs for a desire for territory
A kid got caught in the crossfire
A tired mother can’t take no more
She grabbed a bottle full of sleeping pills and took about 24
Human beings are laying on the pavement
Cause they’re a part of a mental enslavement
The cop snipers, little babies in dirty diapers
This type of life is making you hyper
People scouting a torched-out building
And got killed when the cold air filled in
Is hell really suggested?
No more persons arrested, a child molested
A little kid says ""Yo
I got a color tv, cd player and car stereo
And all I want is a capsule
I also got a .38, don’t give me no hassle""
One kid heads straight for the top
And gets stopped and popped by a crooked cop
Look behind you when you walk
That’s how it is in the streets of New York

Yo VIP, let's kick it

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby

[Verse 1]
Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance go rush to the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it you better gangway
You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Hook]
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby

[Verse 2]
Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
""Did you stop?"" No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean
They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

[Hook]
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby

[Verse 3]
Take heed cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this.  Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade
So fast, other DJs say ""Damn!""
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it

[Hook]
Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby

[Outro]
Yo man let's get out of here
Word to your mother
Ice ice baby too cold
Ice ice baby too cold too cold
Ice ice baby

Attention all ladies
The Candyman is on the prowl
And for those that wanna get busy
You gots to speak up now

(Candyman)
This rhyme, this time
Is one of a kind, blowing yo mind
Like only the Candyman can
Like a heavyweight champion
Knockin'em out, another bout without a doubt
Once again you can scream and shout
When I rock the bells
Yell out my name
This is what you've been missing
Listen to my heart beat, while I'm whispering
I know your suffering
So sweet a Candyman sweet nothings
Hugging and tugging and rubbing
Loving it all, having a ball
All ya'll girlies next to me
Talking sex to me
We can't do that yet, but I bet will chill
(Candyman telling'em the truth)
Will still end up knockin the boots

(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you

(Candyman)
At each and every show, thers's this groupie
Artis knows what she wants to do to me
She knows my name, knows every rap routine
But how she get in my limousine
Don't act fool, don't drool
I'm just a performer
I was cool but the room got warmer
Norma cornered me in
Her and a friend named Llynn, then
They checked me in to the Holiday Inn
I didn't let'em win, said my pockets was thin
She blew me a kiss
I knew she wasn't new to this
I didn't want to, but the devil made me do it
To the tic-toc ya don't stop
We knock boots till 6 o'clock, as we lay
All night long
And early in the morning she sang this song

(Chorus)
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
Once I get my hands on you
Ooh boy I love you so
Never ever ever gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
(Girl I do)

(Candyman)
Tunnel of love is what I'm entering
When I mention it, you're surrending
Giving it up like a good girl has to
Living it up
Eventually you ask to stay
You're gonna pay for this
Just rest your breast on my chest, yes I'm impressed
With the way you cold love me down
I don't wanna sit down, I just wanna get down
I'm on the ground, down on my knees
Like James Brown singing Please, Please
Round two, I'm down to
Do, what it takes to make you
Understand I'm the Candyman
And I melt in your mouth, not in your hands
Hard as rock, yes I'm no sucka
The boots I knock make me one bad mutha
(Unh Unh...giggling) *2

Knockin, while I'm a hip-hoppin
Many people say my lyrics are shocking
Just because of the simple subject
Everyone should love this
Cause everybody does it
Whether they admit it or if they deny it
You betta keep quiet
Or else you might have to see a few skeletons
But girl thats irrevelent
Break out the bottle of Asti Spumante
Pop off the top and rock wit my posse
Fila Al, Big Dill, and D Fly
We ask the questions, you give the reply
MC Chip, Big Rob and Bud
Rockin on the waterbed, knockin on the rugs
I'm just playing, what I'm saying ain't ill
Girl you should know I'm real

This is a song about those bad days
Start up happy and end up sad days
Talking about that Murphy's law chill
If it can go wrong, yes it will

Went to the store to cop some groceries
Friday night and I had the munchies
Filled the cart till it could not take it
One more bag of chips would break it

Went to the cheek out stood in line
Behind me a girl who was just too fine
Got in the ear while they rang the total
Reached for my wallet uh oh a bolo

Not my day I felt like a dummy
Went to the store and forgot the money

Oops up inside your head
Oops up inside your head
Say oops up

Me and amy under the covers
Scene is hot potential lovers
Demon in the sack is her reputation
In school then she is graduation

Touching holding heavy breathing
I knew I'd get it she is not about teasing
Left on the light so I could see reaction
Amy is a freak guaranteed satisfaction

She is soft as bubble bath
I am as hard as chinese math
Ready for the ultimate affection
Took out a pack obtain my protection

Rolled it on one hard stroke
It was my last and yes it broke

Oops up inside your head
Oops up inside your head
Say oops up

132,1169,N.W.A.,100 Miles And Runnin',20,1990-09-22,"

[Intro: FBI + MC Ren]
Catch those motherfuckers, catch them, catch them
Hey man, keep up keep up, this way, come on man, hurry up
You don't really think you're gonna get away, do you?
We haven't spotted them yet. But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity

[Verse 1: MC Ren]
A 100 Miles and Runnin' -  MC Ren, I hold the gun and
You want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck
Chances are usually not good
Cause I'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood
And gettin' jacked by the you-know-who
When in a black and white the capacity is two
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers
Not wearing medallions, cause we're not stupid, mutherfuckers
They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past
Point blank, they can kiss my black ass
I didn't stutter when I said ""Fuck Tha Police""
Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace
Now it's broken and can't be fixed
Cause police and little black niggers don't mix so
Now I'm creepin' through the fall
Runnin' like a team, we'll see, I might have slayed y'all
So for now pack the gun and
Hold it in the air cause MC Ren has a 100 Miles of Runnin'

[Interlude]
Into this news. Four fugitives are on the run
FBI sources tell us that the four are headed
100 miles to their homebase, Compton

[Break: Dr. Dre + Eazy-E]
Lend me a mutherfuckin' ear
So I can tell you why

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase
With a steady pace on the face that just we raced
The road ahead goes on and on
The shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon
Runnin' on but never runnin' out
Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do
But nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude
Confused, yo but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose
One of the few who's been accused and abused
Of the crime of poisonin' young minds
But you don't know shit til you been in my shoes
And Dre is back from the C-P-T
Droppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E
So fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!
And any mutherfucker that disagrees
Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass
Cause I been a nigga known for havin' a notorious past
My mind was slick - my temper was too quick
Now the FBI's all over my dick

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Got the stick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock
That's when the E jumped off the startin' block
A 100 Miles from home and ,yo, it's a long stretch
A little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch
Yeah, back to Compton again
Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen
Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time
Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind
Runnin' like I just don't care
Compton's 50 miles but , yo, I'mma get there
Archin' my back and on a straight rough
Just like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out
From city to city I'm a menace as I pass by
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm
A straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'
Straight at yo ass, 100 Miles and Runnin'

[Interlude]
This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:
Nowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide
Good luck brothers

[Verse 4: MC Ren]
Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused
I know it was a set-up - So now I'm gonna get up
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong
They got everybody singin' my ""Fuck Tha Police"" song
And while they treat my group like dirt
Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts
So I'mma run til I can't run no more
Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score
I got a urge to kick down doors
At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls

[Verse 5: Dr. Dre]
Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it
So now there's four cause the fifth couldn't make it
The number's even - now I'm leavin'
We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in
Her and the troops are right behind me
But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me

[Verse 6: Eazy-E]
One more mile to go through the dark streets
Runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet
But you know I never stumble or lag last
I'm almost home so I better haul ass
Tearin' up everything in sight
It's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight
Now that chase, the shit, is done and
Four mutherfuckers goin' crazy with
A 100 Miles of Runnin'!

Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Surprise, niggas!

It was a cafe? It was a cafe on the west side
It was a cafe? On
It was a cafe? On the west side, midtown
It was a cafe? On the west side, midtown

Said they had the best cap of Cappucino around
So I stepped in, and I ordered a cup
Someone grabbed me by my throat and said, ""Shut the fuck up!""
And I did, pronto, quick fast
How much longer would the torture last?
In the wrong place, at the wrong time
It was a drug sale, I could feel from behind

Death, it was gettin' closer, right behind my back
Ready to attack
I got shot in a shoot out, and then I died
I could feel it, I was on the other side
In between lives, I'm so confused
What do I do, oh, what do I do?
But was it really time for me to go?

Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?

Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
But then I calmed down, I spotted some friends
That I knew in a past life, way back when
A couple had died in a drug world
And this one guy died fightin' over his girl
Another died drivin' while intoxicated
Why do people make livin' so complicated?
But then I saw a girl, her name was Mary

Introduced to drugs by her boyfriend Harry
He sold crack to the kids on the uptown corners
A social worker named Hannah Smith tried to warn her
But she wouldn't listen, no one listens
I saw the light, I awakened, it was a dream
Man oh man, you shoulda heard me scream
So glad to be given - my life back
So good to be livin' - or is dead better?

I didn't have to run from the bullets or drugs
And I didn't have to run from the murderers or thugs
I didn't have to worry about fallin' from a plane
But at this café was death still callin' my name?
Or did this café even exist?
And was my name just another on the death list?
I knew it couldn't happen, even though
On the bottom of my shirt was a spot of Cappucino
Cappucino, Cappucino

Bust it, to some of you that really don't know
I break it down to you, the word 'Cappucino'
It's somewhat like coffee, then again not quite
It's creamy and smooth, and it goes down light
They charge you 3 dollars, you ask is it worth it?
But when you start drinkin' shit, it'd be workin'
I'm hooked, well, I was, cause, yo, it's the best
But if every time I drink I voyage through death
I leave it alone and just stick to tea
Cappucino was fly, but too fly for me

Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino

Why, oh why? Why, oh why?
Why, oh why did I need Cappucino?
Cappucino, Cappucino
Cappucino, Cappucino

It was a café on the west side
It was a café on the west
It was a café on the west side
It was a café on the west

134,1218,Professor Griff,The Verdict,19,1990-10-06,"

[Skit: Judge + Professor Griff]
All rise!
Professor Griff, make your opening statements, boy
Thank you very much, your Honor
I charge the United States government with being
The number one murderers on the Earth!
I charge the United States government with being
The number one deceivers, liars, kidnappers, thieves on the Earth!
I say America should go to a rap show and let me uh
(Rap a little bit right here)

[Verse 1: Last Asiatic Disciple]
Souls were stole and they try to intimidate us
But it's a fact that being black try to segregate us
Just like pawns, maneuvered on a chess game
They were surprised when Professor Griff came
And took a stand with the upper hand
Gained respect and understood by the other man
So now you say, 'Who is really on trial?'
There's fuckin' racism on every dial
Portrayed on the tube, I'm not wildin'
As a wannabe, you see
From L.A.D., the jury you heard it
Pay attention, back to The Verdict

[Verse 2: Last Asiatic Disciple]
Guilty! How low can you get?
The mothafuckin' president just got a death threat
Because he's stickin' his nose in other people's affair
He doesn't care, that's why they wanna take him outta here
Guilty, because of the simple reason
(What reason? What reason?)
He's in charge, and to the fact that he's the president
But 95 percent of the time he's at his residence
Guilty, press conference after conference after conference
Still not a damn thing gets accomplished
Guilty is The Verdict, but some labels would not let me talk
That's why I choose to Sky-walk

(Man, a man can't do nothing no more! ahh haha haha)
(Guilty)

[Verse 3: Professor Griff]
From a radical mind comes radical production
Political system geared for our destruction
Country is ran and controlled by lames
The code word bred to keep your mind in chains
I still drop knowledge for listeners and readers
While government hitmen stalk black leaders
In God's house you shine, you glitter
You sell your soul to the highest bidder
Don't be fooled by the shit they're poppin'
The finest of drugs they claim to be stoppin'
These never accused, warned or even popped
The C-O-P that makes drops to the cops
Political villains take pay-offs every day
Some white, some black, some straight, some gay
(Gonna pull the sheet off of you)

[Last Asiatic Disciples in unison]
In God we trust you told us
In ships and chains you brought us
Halls of justice you call it
The judge and jury bullshit

[Speech]
There's not one of us here who doesn't want freedom
There's not one of us here who does not want justice and equality
There's not one of us here who doesn't want to see the black man
Lifted up from the mud of white civilization

[Verse 4: Last Asiatic Disciple]
Searchin' and searchin' as if this was hide-and-seek
So now ya know that I have the right to speak
Racism is still part of United Faith of America
OK, now here's some motherfuckin' truth for ya
Order in the court, order in the courtyard
First name to stand out like the man known as Malcolm
Your leader was afraid of playin' me
I'm the jury and judge and I won't be budgin' so just fear me
Last to deny anyone, so hit the bull's eye
Livin' it up, some givin' it up, point blank enough
Too much, too many, too little, too late
Arrivin' when I'm thrivin', nationally I'm attackin'
Our brothers and sisters knowin' what we're showin'
Injectin' law and order in your brain, you were slackin'
Before time had passed from a lyrical filth
But still the kill, and crime gets the big bill
Once more I step to the book for a good look
A lesson so critical, striking with the right hook
To be or not to be, justice in with the jury
The Verdict is death, it's in the Bible
I know you hear me
Fuck that hear-ye hear-ye, as you heard it
Meanwhile I'm the X and now back to The Verdict

[Verse 5: Last Asiatic Disciple]
I'm guilty! So what the fuck
I'm stuck between a wall and a Mack Truck
Slam on the brake 'cuz I may not a fade or mistake
I won't budge, so you be the judge
Of whether you hit me, it don't mean shit to me
Cuz I don't give a damn, can't you understand
If I'm guilty, then charge me only on
Expressin' my feelings through my song
If you lock me up and captivate me
I'll have to activate the L.A.D
Police who try to make an arrest
Better watch they backs for the A.D.S
Handcuffs could never contain
Like a pre-production or gold black chain
So I charge you on a count of bullshit
A-yo guilty is The Verdict

(This court is dismissed)

[Intro: MC Ren]
Ah yeah, we gonna get busy one time
For the motherfuckin bitches out there in Compton
To this slow, slow, slow ass beat
We got my man Chip in the house
My man Young D, my man Donovan
And I am the incredible MC Ren
And my man Lil Nation's gonna do it somethin like this

[Verse 1: CPO Boss Hogg]
This is the ballad of a menace
Not to be confused with that of a grimace
I'm in this to be number one, when I step upon
And walk the streets, stalk the meat, like that of a predator
Blow the brains out the head of my competitors
I'm a product of your sins, though you say I never heard of ya
A killer, dope dealer, gangsta murderer
Merciless maniac, monical manipulation
Primary focus of your local police station
I roll cold in my 'llac
Pumpin sounds that are great, doin a jack move
As I groove, the gangsta melody
Heads are cracked to a nine year old
And I've been told pimpin hoes is a felony
But I'm not a doctor or lawyer I wasn't made to be
Ever Luciferic because I get paid to be
There ain't no rehabilitatin, pull a gat on your grandmother
Then take her social security
The boundary lines of my jurisdiction expands
From day to day, ruler of all I survey
And with that, load up my gat then I pack
So I can buzz on the suckers that you replenish
This is the ballad of a menace

[Hook]
""I'm a menace to society""

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
This is a ballad of a menace, Ren will finish and diminish
All the suckers that thought they could flow like me that was in this
Society wishes for my death, or my downfall
But they're playin theyself, as if they playin some roundball
Cause I'm terrorizin, the territory I'm steppin on
Endangerin citizens while I'm keepin my weapon on
My hip like a psycho, cause to me it's hospitable
I just got word, the Ruthless Villain was critical
Let's get it straight, the ones that want some can come with that
Illiterate motherfuckers I make you look dumb with that
Stumble and fumble cause I'mma crush til you crumble
So you can stutter and stutter but keep it down to a mumble
MC Ren is never taken as the sucker
In other words, I'm a bad motherfucker
So next time I walk your streets you should know
To lock your doors, and close your windows
And if you was thinkin that protection could stop me
It takes a continent full of niggas to drop me
And for me to be vicious yo it's valid
While I'm conductin and producin
A ballad of a motherfuckin menace

[Hook]
""I'm a menace to society""

[Verse 3: CPO Boss Hogg]
I carry my balls just like a gauge
Nobody's safe when I'm enraged
Sacrifice the suckers and weak motherfuckers
That run in fear, I'm the menace to misery
Answer the knock at your door and open the AK delivery
Best known for bein unsympathetic when I pick em
Cause sympathy is for the pathetic and to the victim
Smoke one and smoke another mercy is my only incapacity
Yo cause I'm a hard brotha
Maniacal madman, son of Mephisto
Fine to go to hell, since I was an embryo
A criminal, standin in a gangsta pose
Steppin with Ren the villain slappin up all the hoes
Your mother your sister your daughter your wife
And if you was reincarnated I would snatch your second life
In it for the money, down for me myself and I
You see, and fuck the community
I know in conclusion that death is my destiny
But fuck it, be shootin motherfuckers that's left to me
So write my malevolent epitath, put it in the book of Guiness
And title it, The Ballad of a Menace

(We're on a mission) --] Salt-n-Pepa

[ VERSE 1 ]
This is a mission, not a small time thing
Let me tell you 'bout what happened when the phone went ( *ring* )
Well, I was coolin at the crib with this girl Suzanne
And everything was goin just accordin to plan
When the phone rang - yo, I couldn't believe it
Told myself to ignore it, forget it, leave it
Just when things had started goin great
It rang again I said, ""Hold up, wait""
Picked up the phone, yelled, ""Who the hell is this?""
Somebody said, ""This is serious business
There's a tape in the mailbox between your doors
Take the tape from the box, and put it in yours""
I listened to the tape and my mouth just dropped
I picked up the phone, but the man hung up
It said, yo, 'this tape will self-destruct'
I pressed the deck, but the tape was stuck
Oh well, what the heck, I just cleaned up the mess
Opened up the closet, got the bullet-proof west
Loaded up the sawed-off, the double-barrel
The rambo knife with the hunting apparel
Threw on the trench, kissed the girl good-bye
She said, ""Special Ed, don't go, you might die""
Started cryin and huggin on me, so I shot her
I said, ""Sorry baby, but I gotta do what I gotta

(You're on a mission)
Do what I gotta

This is a mission, not a small-time thing

[ VERSE 2 ]
Took the express on a air force jet
The thoughts in my mind broke me out into sweat
I was thinkin of the message again and again
In particular the name of Lu Chin Chen
Yo, I landed in Japan with intent to kill
You could tell I wasn't jokin by the look on my grill
Took a look at the picture of the man that I was after
A 5 foot 10 black-belt karate master
Knew where to find him, knew where he would be
I turned around and showin up Mr. Chen found me
I looked him in the eye with a stare so cold
I said, ""I came to revenge for the rhymes you stole
Now you must die, because that is my mission""
He flipped back, got into a fighting position
The tiger style, the shit was wild
He threw his hands in the air, he started to smile
I said, ""You can smile now, but you won't for long
Cause sucker, you'll be sorry that you stole my song""
He said, ""Choose your style"", I broke fool, I said, ""What?""
Pulled out the knife, tried to shove it in his gut
It didn't even cut, I flipped, I started buggin
Pulled out the hand gun, I shot a slug in
His chest, he said, ""Buddah bless"" and stood proud
Out shot the bullet, Mr. Chen just bowed
So I shot him again - yo, I couldn't believe
Mr. Chen caught the bullet in this two front teeth
Yo, he kicked me on the floor just like I was a child
I got fed up, I fought him Flatbush Style
Stood to my feet, threw my hands to the sky
Shaked him then, I faked him, then I caught him in the eye
He started stumblin, yo, I started wildin
He tripped, busted his lip, I started smilin
Knew he was defeated, but I wasn't done yet
So I shot him with the shotie, then I jetted in the jet

(You're on a mission)
Jetted in the jet

This is a mission, not a small-time thing

139,1245,K-Solo,Your Mom's In My Business,21,1990-10-13,"

Yeah! Tell your moms to mind her business

Your mom's in my business, she's in my business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business ""Before I let go""

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business ""Before I let go""

When I first met your moms, I gave your mom respect
But now I see she knows me, I see that she suspects
I'm some bad guy, I don't know why
You have to tell your mother lies about you and I
But when your first told me, she said that I was a no-no
Cause of my haircut and people call me Solo
Before the time you said, you really didn't care
Now you tell me to change my name, or even cut my hair
How would you ever go become somebody's wife
And at the age of 22 you let your mother run your life?
Me, I'm not the type to tell your moms to get lost
Yell out loud to flip and get my point across
See I think you should tell your moms to leave us two alone
And stop reading our love letters and evesdropping on the phone
Cause if you really liked my, you'd let your mommy know
She gotta mind her business ""Before I let go""

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business ""Before I let go"" (Repeat 2x)

Remember your sister and her boyfriend Sam Seed?
Your momma's the real reason why your sister lost her man
Her and sam went together, for a real long time
But Sam controlled her body while your mom controlled her mind
Not saying she was hurt when your moms made 'em break up
Deep down I could tell, though, your sister wanted to make up
With Sam, because she wanted to become his wife
And now she can't do that because your mother runs her life
You baby, you do the same things, too
You always want to to the crazy things your mommy wants you to do
Like when we went to the movie, she had to come along
I went back and forth and forth and back for peanuts and popcorn
She took advantage, cause I was living fat
I couldn't even watch the movie, she kept me running back
For something that she wanted somewhere else in the store
I walked and got it all til the man said there's no more
And when I got back to the car, she took her time to move over
When I sat in the car, my movie was like over
I was mad, hurt, I didn't want to talk
Deep down I wanted you and your mommy both to walk
I took you home anyway, like what the heck
Cause I was raised to treat people's mothers with respect
But when we got to your home, we wasn't left alone
She waited there in the car with us until I headed home
You called me on the phone, saying you were alone
But that's a lie because I heard your moms breathing on the phone
And if you really like me, let your moms know
She should mind her business ""Before I let go""

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business ""Before I let go"" (Repeat 2x)

Without a doubt, me, like when I come to your house
She'll ask me crazy questions and start looking in my mouth
Her friends start laughing and I feel just like a jerk
I told 'em I don't know where my mom and dad work
I really know where they work, but that's between them and me
I can't be putting mom and dad's business in the street
Cause if I told her that my family both work for the state
Right after that she would've asked me how much money do they make
Then she'd go around the town, bragging and boasting
Telling the neighborhood what my family's grossing
Your moms, your moms, why is she so nosey?
She plays me like a game but I'm no ring-around-the-rosey
I even seen your dad at the family barbeque
He said ""I don't see nothing wrong with my daugher seeing you""
But it's your wife mister, she don't think that I'm charming
She thinks she's Mr. Whippit and she thinks I'll squeeze her Charmin
I promise I won't do this to your daugher, calm man
Cause when I'm with girls, my reputation is not harming
If I'm not on tour, I'm working out at my house
I'll pick your daugher up sometime, and I'll even take her out
And every time I try to do this, I see without a doubt
Your wife will follow me around like a cop on a stakeout
And when I told the man that, I thought he would help me out
Til he said ""I can't tell her nothing, she'll kick me out the house""
See, I know you girls, I know you girls, I know you girls, I know you girls
Mothers love you, and they're concerned
But if you don't solve your own problems, then how can you learn?
And guys, if you're in a relationship like this
Don't be afraid to tell your girlfriend tell your moms to mind her business
But after me and you girl, I'd rather stay Solo
Because your moms can't mind her business, I'm a have to let you go
Because your mom is in my business

Your mom's in our business, she's in our business
Can't you see girl that your mom's trying to end this?
Your mom's in our business
Now tell your moms to mind her business ""Before I let go"" (Repeat 2x)

[Rakim]
Planet, Earth, was my place of birth
Born to be the soul controller, of the universe
Besides the part of the map, I hit first
Any environment I can adapt, when it gets worst
The rough gets goin, the goin gets rough
When I start flowin, the mic might bust
The next state'll shake, from the power I generate
People in Cali, used to think it was earthquakes
Cause times was hard, on the Boulevard
So I Bogart and never get scarred, I'm God
But it seems, like I'm locked in hell
Lookin over the edge, but the R never fell
I tripped and slipped, cause my Nikes got gripped
Stand on my own two feet, and come equipped
Any stage I'm seen on, or mic I fiend on
I stand alone, and need nothin' to lean on
Going for self, with a long way to go
So much to say, but I still flow slow
I come correct, and I won't look back
Cause it ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Even the (ghetto)

[Rakim]
I learn to relax in my room and escape from New York
And return through the wound of the world as a thought
Thinkin how hard it was to be born
Me bein cream with no physical form
Millions of cells with one destination
To reach the best part as life's creation
Nine months later, a job well done
Make way, cause here I come
Since I made it this far I can't stop now
There's a will and a way and I got the know-how
To be, all I can be and more
And see, all there is to see before
I'm called to go back to the essence
It's a lot to learn so I study my lessons
I thought the ghetto was the worst that could happen to me
I'm glad I listened when my father was rappin to me
Cause back in the days, they lived in caves
Exiled from the original man, they strayed away
Now that's what I call hard times
I'd rather be here to exercise the mind
Then I take a thought around the world twice
From knowledge to born back to knowledge precise
Across the desert, that's hot as the Arabian
But they couldn't cave me in, cause I'm the Asian
Reachin for the city of Mecca, visit Medina
Visions of Nefertiti, then I seen a
Mind keeps traveling, I'll be back after
I stop and think about the brothers and sisters in Africa
Return the thought through the eye of a needle
For miles I fought and I just brought the people
Under the dark skies, on a dark side
Not only there, but right here's an apartheid
So now is the time for us to react
Take a trip through the mind and when you get back
Understand your third eye seen all of that
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Even the (ghetto)
Even the (ghetto)

No more props, I want property, in every borough
Nobody's stoppin me, because I'm thorough
Rhymes I make gimme real estate for me to own
Wherever I bless a microphone
Double-oh-seven is back and relaxin
On point and reactin, and ready for action
I'm so low key that you might not see me
Incognito, and takin it easy (ghetto)
Quiet as kept on a hush hush
In front of a crowd, I get loud, there's a bumrush
Be calm, keep a low pro and play the background
Hopin the whack rapper put the mic back down
So rip it, break it in half, go 'head and slam it
Cause when it's time to build I'm a mechanic
Of bondin and mendin, attachin and blendin
So many solos, there is no endin
People in my neighborhood, they know I'm good
From London to Hollywood, wherever I stood
Footprints remain on stage ever since
Sidewalks and streets, I leave fossils and dents
When I had sex, I left my name on necks
My trademark was left throughout the projects
I used to get rich when I played c-lo
When I rolled 4, 5, 6, they go, ""We know""
So I collect my cash then slide
I've got my back, my gun's on my side
It shouldn't have to be like that
I guess it ain't where you're from, it's where you're at

Special equipped for this microphone junkie
Cocoa Chanelle rocks the beats up on the intro
Cuts up on the fader with the hands, with an elbow
She's my DJ, she keeps the beats movin
She's a female and she keeps on groovin
Woop! She swung your head out, thought you was retarded
Nodded your head and didn't realize you started
This funky jam that you can't resist
The name of this one's called 'Nod Your Head to This'

Nod your head to this (3x)

Now I'm speakin like a deacon, cold servin like a pastor
Preachin like a reverend, I'm the microphone master
Bust the funky rhymes that keep you on the go
That make you nod your head steady in a bodily flow
I keep humpin, pumpin to get the party jumpin
Never perpetratin, cause I'm not about frontin
Just givin what you want is somethin funky like this
Just like a girl you wanna ride and catchin sexual bliss
And yes, I'm comin fully charged, equipped and packed
To make your head bob and weave and swing forth and back
It's like a Tyson bout and this is main event
And I'm electrifyin the minds of all the ladies and gents
Cold swingin things the way it's supposed to be
To make you nod your head, yo, simultaneously
To a groove that makes you move and keeps you in sync
Just like you're tappin your feet, yo, you do not think
About what you're doin, but you can't resist
The Kings of Swing is in the house, and hey yo, nod your head to this

Nod your head to this (2x)

It sounds funky

Catch the Swing fever, catch it while it's hot
The Kings is smokin and we rock non-stop
Your temperature's risin, your brain's gettin numb
This is only a dose, wait till the album comes
With more beats to hump, nod your head and get dumb
So if you wanna battle, come, come, come, come
Cause I'm poetically inclined to find a rhyme all the time
To fit a funky beat with keyboards behind
The SP-12, hittin the switcher keys
Noddin your head to dope beats like these
This is a spirit, you'll feel it, you'll hear it
The only difference is, yo, you can't get near it
And in the process suckers get pissed
Because they got caught - noddin they head to this

Nod your head to this (2x)

It sounds funky

Nod your head to this

Brother what is with you, you can't take a hint?
I need to shove a splint between your eyes for you to see
You and me were never meant to be
Your homeboy likes me, I like him too, get out the picture
I get your point but I'm not rolling with the punch
I scrunched up the letter you wrote me in lunch
In 5th period I pay no notice to your motion
My work is on the table, my pen's in locomotion
Every time I turn around, you're looking at my face
I try to ignore you, the bell rings, I race out the room
Zoom to another room, sit down, what do you know?
The lover's in town
The other brother (Who?) The one I want to talk to
Sitting three seats back, and I'mma walk over to him
And give him the letter I wrote
Because my feelings towards him are brewing, ya know?

Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 2x)

In 7th the knucklehead walks in and sits down beside me
I said ""Yo, why you trying to ride me?""
Day in and day out I can't seem to get you off my back
What do you think I should do about that?
In fact it's embarrassing, what a buffoon
You even follow me in the ladies bathroom
Give me a break, I can't take it, the stakes are too high
Besides, there goes the other brother
I'm not Keith Sweat, so don't sweat me
The other brother's smooth approach is what gets me
He intrigues the Mon you know
So I suggest the course towards me you blow
You're wasting time pursuing Monie
Cause she's pursuing the lover only
And as my mother did she told me
Go for what you know, Mo, yo

Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 2x)

Bringing matters to a close and everybody knows
That I'm no longer in the middle
I made my decision, precisely, precision is a must
For me to solve another riddle
Step into a brand new rhythm,-ism schisms
Nope, I'm not with 'em, I've given
My undivided attention, you know what I'm saying?
No type of games I'm playing when

Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
Yep, Monie's in the middle (Where that at?) In the middle
Monie in the middle (Where she at?) In the middle
(Go Mon, Mon, what is she?) Monie in the middle (Repeat 4x)

145,1294,Sir Mix-A-Lot,I Got Game,20,1990-10-27,"

[Girls voice]
""Man I wish I could find me a brother with some game""

To the rescue!

Here's a little somethin' for you whacked out suckers
Rollin' twenty-third, sellin' dope to cluckers
Your bank is thick, but you got no game
Spittin' at freaks runnin' superfly slang
I'm comin' up the ave' hard as hell
In a droptop 'Vette with a greenwood tail
Girls are jockin', lookin' for a knockin'
Smart investments, keep me clockin'
You know a 'Vette only got two seats
Just enough room for a player and a freak
Rollin' in the park, 'n I seen this cutey
L.A. face, with the Oakland booty
She's on tip, but I'm playin' that role
Talkin' to the home boys, showin' my gold
Skeez on bell, Levi's swell
I'm spittin' that game, and I'm spittin' it well
Rolled up, pulled up on the girly
""Girl you wanna ride in my 'Vette?""
""Why surely!""
That's right baby, blowin' me a kiss
Thinkin' Mixalot gonna make you rich
Highside, highside, vapors that's right
Can't get play cause my games so tight
Now she's wit' it, skirts in effect
Layin' on the back-a my 'vette
I got game, I got game, You know I got game, I got game

POP THAT GAME

Bye-bye baby, Mix gotta roll
Switch to the Benz and I gotta get mo'
Hit the strip, seen this skinny
Butt shook like a 426 Hemi
Not just butt, baby hadda motor
Stacked to the max, hair to the shoulders
She's older but I can mold 'er
Dropped that game and it hit like boulders
Now she's sprung, sittin' in my Benz
Rollin' up the tint so you can't see in
Playin' this tape of old Luther stuff
""You wanna get with me, this ain't wild enough""
That's a cue, sorry Luther
Brother you can sing, but I just can't use ya
Thought she was cool, but the girl likes beat
Freak freak freak freak, baby wanna freak
Def 'n dope, ""You slangin'"" Nope
Callin' me a dealer cause I sport fat rope
Kept poppin' that game, knowin' I can get it
""Take me to the lake Mix, so we can get wit' it""
Oh no, time for the ramble, bring a jimmy hat
Cause I hate to gamble
Huffed 'n puffed 'n I just got in
Messin' up the backa my Benz
I got game girl - I got game

Two down, two to go
Can't live my night right if I don't knock four
I'm in a big 500SEL
Interior hot, with a perfume smell
Took it on home, hit the shower
'Bout to get busy in one more hour
Ducks look, but they never will find me
Hopped in my number two Benz 190
Here a skirt, there a skirt
Everywhere a skirt, skirt
Gotta have game, if you wanna get work
""Ah, you ain't nothin'""
Some suckers wanna crush me
Smooth, wit' a move, baby girl. Rush me
Here it is, from the wizard of hip-hop
A lesson in game, make the girls get hot
Picked up a girl named Mattie
Caught static from the sucker in a seven-two caddy
Mattie was hot, but her name was ""not""
I ain't worried 'bout that, I ain't tyin' no knot
Took her to the hotel, game went strong
She thought I spent bank, but I really spent coupons
But it's cool, cause my rhyme went smooth
Savin' my money, cause my mouth is a tool
Rolled up close, when I hit the spit
I ain't worried 'bout my breath, cause I brush my teeth
Popped that game, freak got weak
Hit that jackpot, swept them feet
Mattie got busy with the bedroom eyes
Layin' on the big king-sized
I got game - I got game, girl - I got game - I got game

Yeah that's right home cut, I got G A M E, snatchin' up girlies
An' rollin' up suckers, know whatta I mean

Through with Mattie that makes three
""I'm gonna miss you babe, you gonna miss me?""
Got loose cause the girl hadda big caboose
Hadda break down cause the girl had juice
""I'm gonna miss you baby""
Smooth ain't it? Girls so sprung that she almost fainted
Headin' for the crib, tired brother
Thinking I was through when I spotted me another
Baby looks good so you know what the means
Drive around the block with the gangsta lean
Open that sun roof, crank that beat
Bumpin' up the avenue, impressin' them freaks
What's up baby, rump so big? The girl's on tip like funk on pigs
Runnin that game, cause I wanna get work
Sit don't rip rap home girl shirt
Here she comes, hopped in my car
Somethin' 'bout my Benzo's star and bars
Spit, spit, runnin' that game
I'm feelin' confident about another thick dame
All of a sudden, my game got crushed
Some sucker pulled up and his ride was plush
Rolled up smooth, the girls was waitin'
5.0, 24K Daytons
Oh-oh, think quick cause my girls jumpin' on home boy's tip
Better change my game, try another lure
Cause home boy's lookin' like Al B. Sure
But it's cool, cause I whipped out bank
Big dead presidents made her think
Back in effect, situation in hand
I'm the brother that the others can't stand
An' I got game, I got game, you know I got game

[Intro]
Talking bout the ghetto...funky, funky ghetto
Trying to survive, trying to stay alive

[Chorus]
The ghetto
The ghetto
(Talking bout the ghetto)
The ghetto
The ghetto
(Funky, funky ghetto)

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
Even though the streets are bumpy, lights burned out
Dope fiends die with a pipe in their mouth
Old school buddies not doing it right
Every day it's the same and it's the same every night
I wouldn't shoot you bro but I'd shoot that fool
If he played me close and tried to test my cool
Every day I wonder just how I'll die
Only thing I know is how to survive
There's only one rule in the real world
And that's to take care of you, only you and yours
Keep dealing with the hard times day after day
Might deal me some dope but then crime don't pay
Black man trying to break into my house again
Thought he got off dope doing time in the pen
Even though my brothers do me just like that
I get a lot of love so I'm giving it back to the ghetto

[Chorus]
The ghetto
(Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
The ghetto
(Funky, funky ghetto)
The ghetto
(Trying to live our lives)
The ghetto
(Won't ya tell 'em 'bout it Too $hort)

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
So just peep the game and don't call it crap
'Cause to me, life is one hard rap
Even though my sister smoked crack cocaine
She was nine months pregnant, ain't nothing changed
600 million on a football team
And her baby died just like a dope fiend
The story I tell is so incomplete
Five kids in the house, no food to eat
Don't look at me and don't ask me why
Mama's next door getting high
Even though she's got five mouths to feed
She'd rather spend her money on a H-I-T
I always tell the truth about things like this
I wonder if the mayor overlooked that list
Instead of adding to the task force send some help
Waiting on him I'd better help myself
Housing Authority and the O.P.D
All these guns just to handle me in the ghetto...

[Chorus]
The ghetto
(People are dyin')
The ghetto
(Children are cryin')
The ghetto
(Don't have enough to eat)
The ghetto
(Don't even have shoes on their feet)
The ghetto

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Even though they put us down and call us animals
We make real big banks and buy brand new clothes
Drive fancy cars, make love to stars
Never really saying just who we are
We use alias names like TOO $HORT
Sell you stuff you might kill for
Young kids grow up and that's all they know
Didn't teach him in school now he's slangin' dope
Only thing he knows is how to survive
But will he kill another brother before he dies?
In the ghetto, you keep one eye open
All day long, just hoping and hoping
You can pay your bills and not drink too much
Then the problems of life you'll be throwing up
Like me, but you don't see
Ten years from now, where will you be?

[Chorus]
The ghetto
(Tryin' to get out of the ghetto)
The ghetto
(But I got no place to go)
The ghetto
(Tryin' to survive in the heart of the ghetto)
The ghetto
(Ha, 'cause that's the only place that I know)

[Verse 4: Too $hort]
So much game in a Too $hort rap
Can't be white and whites can't be black
Why you wanna act like someone else?
All you gotta do is just be yourself
We're all the same color underneath
Short Dog is in the house, you better listen to me
Never be ashamed of what you are
Proud to be black, stand tall and hard
Even though some people give you no respect
Be intelligent, when you put 'em in check
'Cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way
And when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say
So if you don't listen, it's not my fault
I'll be getting paid and you'll be paying the cost
Sitting in the jailhouse running your mouth
While me and my people try to get out

[Chorus]
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Funky, funky ghetto)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Tryin' to survive)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Tryin' to stay alive)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Funky, funky ghetto)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Got no place else to go)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)
(Tryin' to stay alive)
The ghetto (Talkin' 'bout the ghetto)

150,1324,Compton's Most Wanted,I'm Wit Dat,25,1990-11-03,"

Yo, Eiht and Chill
It's a rumour going around sayin
Compton's Most Wanted ain't funky enough
Like we can't cut it, or somethin like that
Personally, I don't know where the rumour got started
They must be waitin for the album to drop or somethin
But anyway, in the meantime
Eiht, you're the first one up on this demo
Set the record straight

[Verse 1: MC Eiht]
As I commence with the def dope strategy
Of the lyrics I'm bustin, suckers tend to get mad at me
Fill it to the limit at the top of my cup
Press your luck, lose a buck as you get tossed up
I presume that you fools wanna get some
As the bass starts to boom I begin to get real dumb
Downest is the Eiht from the C-p-t
Floor a punk in a minute tryin to fuck with me
Or try to stick up, so watch me kick up a little dust
Stupid little punk, Eiht'll all-out bust
Compton's Most W-a-n-t-e-d
Top choice, best, can't fade the rest
Hah! Eiht is only good for steady dumpin
Geah, Unknown and Slip be like bumpin
High, cause you're so fly - dud
Kick back with the pack, and I get high off the bud'
Cause I'm with that

Yeah, Eiht, that was like funky
I think that'll do the trick
But Chill - you're next up to bat on this
You with it?

[Verse 2: Tha Chill]
Yo, let's go, another star
The p-a-r-t-n-e-r
Of the E, the back-and-forth, the mic-switchin
And the lyrics Eiht write be like pitchin
Rough, cause the rhythm makes your goosebumps pump
I could drop you in a minute, so shut up, chump
I'm down for doin, won't be called no punk
Rag a pack, crackerjack, hit the Indo blunt
Chill, will get ill, so get real
Still, let me kill, and you can pay up the bill
The lyrics that I bust make you brag and boast
How CMW rocks the fresh West Coast
Eiht and Chill, two fresh Afro-Americans
DJ Mike T is down with me ???
3 The Hard Way is the way that it goes
Just another dumb victim with a swoll' up nose
Because I'm with that

(Yeeaaah!)
(Cool, I'm with it)	--] The D.O.C

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
3rd verse, I'm here to cause a little shock
Down to rock round the block while you're ridin my jock
The coolest, geah, I got to play it cool
Keep it calm, no alarm while I dis a fool
Unlike a pumped-up there's no need for gettin hostile
Get hip and take a sip of chicken bottle
In other words, I could be drunk as a skunk
And I still won't waste time to get up with a punk
It's competition that makes me wanna push, push
Grab a skee next to me, start to water her bush
A battle against a roody-poo punk like that
Will mean that the Eiht will have to peel your cap
Chap, so wake up to pay attention to what I'm sayin
Won't stop sprayin, won't stop slayin
Won't give a break to a fool who's fake
Want a challenge? You can come and challenge the Eiht
Cause I'm with that

(Get on it)
(The music just turns me on)

[Verse 4: Tha Chill]
I run you wreckless when I see that you are fake
Leave you breathless, because I got the back of Eiht
On the mike, I take care of business, I do my job
Don't preprare, just beware when I'm ready to squab
Make a note, program it in your memory bank
Unlike a boat I won't sink, cause I'm rough as a tank
Surprisin, realizin of who I am
Compton's most wanted MC, and I don't give a damn
Jokers think it's funky, no time for a fake
Sucker punks try to steal the dope rhymes that I make
My homeboy Mike T cuts like a savage
And Unknown and Slip does damage
So go ahead, and perpetrate like you're with it
You'll be caught, you'll be fought, you'll be stalked in a minute

Geah Chill
That's how we handle that business
Butterin em up, this boy
(Geah, I'm with it)

You got to do this like a Blackman"" . Mmmm...
So I take this into consid'
Call upon the intellect to create what I did
Ghetto! Stay strictly ghetto is my motto
I got 'em trying to place me as a role model
Should one say role model or should the term be example?
Of a wise black leader, speaker
Self will say poor righteous teacher, weaker people don't always agree
Check ... what I may manifest next
Poorly Righteous Teachers droppin' Holy Intellect
Givin' you da best of what I may protest
DIVINE IS MY PROJECTS...HELL YES

Why? Because PRT is holy as the mind
Check, what must one do to come next?
Let's show holy intellect
Thoughts created from the crescent of the brain cells
Fell deep into this mic that I be holdin'
I told them PRT be's always soul controllin'
They laugh but listen to the lessons I be born
I'm the teacher, or am I one subjected to the negative? Nope
It's amazing how my thoughts can be wrote to perform

Word is bond, the Wise is makin' knowledge born

[Verse 1]
Move over bacon there's something meatier
A natural born lover with love to give free to ya
Meatier, so all you bacon lovers move over
Cause I'm so smooth they should call me Blackanova
I'm not tryin' to say that I'm number one
I'm just a smooth operator that gets the job done
So, let me lick you from head to toe
Realllllllll slowwwwwwwww
Cause ever since I was young I could keep girls sprung
Just by the movement of my tongue
I remember it all started way back
In ummm... Kindergarten!!
Some played with Legos, some played with Play-Doh
But I was feelin' girls like a ripe tomato
And now it's 1990 and you can find me as I dunk
Lockin' up girls like I want
Yes I got a harem, but I don't share em
I collect em like padium and MMM, you gotta see em
Because the ladies is all I dream of
And not even Anita Baker can give sweeter love
You know why?

Cause I can do it right (4X)
Yesssss I can!

[Verse 2]
Step up girls and get somethin' to treasure
And welcome to the Smooth Operator's Palace of Pleasure
And if you're wondering if I want it --
I got a Craftmatic with your name written on it
I reminisce saying I take em eight to eighty
But I was just kiddin', no you have to be a lady
Even if you're too young, with the hypest body
I just don't go to a Similac party
So all those of age, we can get intimate
Bumper to bumper, so you can get your fender bent
I treat girls just like pastry
Mmmmmmmmm *smacks lips* Tasty!
Very kinky when it comes to hanky panky
A well known player, but not for the Yankees
I won't say I'm the baddest or portray that role
But I'm of the top two, and my father's gettin' old
I'm taking love to a brand new height
And if loving girls is wrong I don't wanna be right
Cause my man Babyface said that it's no crime
And of course I'll work Diana Ross overtime
You know why?

Cause I can do it right (4X)
Yesssss I can!

[Verse 3]
If I was on the movies I'd frame Roger Rabbit
Play Spike Lee with Jessica, because she's gotta have it
But I'm not an actor, I'm just a mack
That charms girls as I whisper sweet nothings to attract her
And bring about that feeling of passion
To have her on my body like modern day fashion
Layin' next to me, in pure ecstasy
You're like a door and you know that sex the key
So send your man to the lost and found
I'm bringing something that's world renowned
In other words - good lovin' that's major
I got girls in more areas than a SkyPager
Running around saying, ""Please me, please me, please me""
That's why I say it ain't easy
But I've been able to maintain my status
With ladies macking without if's, and's, or maybe's
And other players just can't understand it
And couldn't keep they girls even if they were branded
I always end up with them on my shelf
*SMACK* I gotta jump back and kiss myself
You know why?

Cause I can do it right (4X)
Yesssss I can!

[Intro: Ice Cube & Yo-Yo]
[Ice Cube]
Yo Jinx, man, we gotta find somebody that's down for hers, man
All these girls sympin', man!
Who you think fit the category?

[Yo-Yo]
It's me, the brand new intelligent black woman Y-O-Y-O. Which is Yo-Yo, but I'm not to be played like I was made by Mattel.
But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male
I rhyme about uprising, uplifting the woman
[?] superior to handle any male
Any time, any rhyme, any flow, and any show
And if you ask my producers, they'll reply “No…”

[Hook: Ice Cube]
“You can't play with my Yo-Yo!”
(Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out)

[Verse 1]
My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a ho, no
I like to flow so swift, it's got to be a gift
So yo, let the beat lift as I rip and rhyme
And rap and slap all the girls who can't adapt
To the fact I hit the 8-ball often
The earrings I wear are called Dolphins
Check the booty, yo, it's kind of soft and
If you touch it, you living in a coffin (word to mother)
I'm in the 90's, you're still in the 80's, right?
I rock the mic, they say I'm not lady-like!
But I'm a lady, who will pull a stunt though
I K-O suckas, and even hit the blunt
So what you wanna do? You must play hit and run
It through to me, you simply can't get none
You wetter than a hot whore in snow
Tell 'em, Ice Cube!

[Hook] (Ice Cube)
No, you can't play with my Yo-Yo, suckas
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
(What's your name baby?)

[Verse 2]
That's right, my name is Yo-Yo, but no, I'm not a Duncan
As I rap, Chilly Chill bring in the funk and
I'll steal yo man, that's if he is a hunk and
He'll call me Baby Yo, or even Pumpkin
I may be Buttercup, or even Miss Yo
We had dinner, and now we drinking Cisco
Hit the slow jams, it's getting cozy
You're home alone, so now you getting nosy
You're kind of young
So of course you had to call my place
Hang up in my face
It's a sad case of who your man's giving the dollars
What? Yep, I put lipstick on his collar
At home, he's gotta listen to ya holler
But he'll slap you, and sock ya, so why bother?!
But if you come knocking at my door (ay yo)
I'll smoke you, tell 'em, Ice!

[Hook] (Ice Cube)
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, sucka
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, yo, yo
Fool, 1990, stayin' sucka free, haha!
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo!
Yeah, tell em whats up

[Verse 3: Yo-Yo]
Yo, I hope you realize one day
That you're ""weak"" as Monday through Sunday
So listen to my Y-O, here's my bio
And next to me?
Ha! You're not fly, yo?!
You lack skills to be a woman that's black
Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts?!
Yo-Yo, is just trying to stop ya
Because the world ain't a big soap opera
It only takes one punch to drop ya
And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya
But no, I'm not living like that verse
Although I pack a real small Gat in my purse (right, right)
But no, it's not to cause corruptions
Just to fight back on destruction
Just thought you wanna know about the Y-O-Y-O
Yo, should I tell 'em, Ice?

[Hook] (Ice Cube)
They know what time it is
Fools, yeah!
You can't play with my Yo-Yo, yo yo
I'm out. I thought you knew!

Yo-Yo, the brand new intelligent black lady
Stompin' to the 90s!
For all y'all suckas
Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo

[Verse 4]
I'm similar to a metaphor, makes them want to yell on
But keep it at a limit to where they're yelling, ""More, more!""
I am very versatile, changing my ways to different styles
Knowledge is the key, experience is from my background
Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel inferior
Falling back on the hands of time makes no man superior
Should we dare to take the stand
And diss back all the men
Who know no more but [?] and thinks wit his ding-a-ling?
I think it's time that we defeat by standing on our on two feet
If we wanna live with justice and harmony
How many more rounds must I go in order to let my people know
Times were hard, things have changed (Don't try to play me out)

159,1422,LL Cool J,Around The Way Girl,23,1990-12-01,"

(You got me shook up, shook down, shook out on your loving)

[Verse 1]
I want a girl with extensions in her hair
Bamboo earrings, at least two pair
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude
That's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
She likes to dance to the rap jams
She sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
Honey coated complexion, using Camay
Lets hear it for the girl, she's from around the way

[Hook]
I need an around the way girl
Around the way girl
That's the one for me
She's the only one for me
I need an around the way girl

[Verse 2]
Silky, milky her smile is like sunshine
That's why I had to dedicate at least one rhyme
To all the cuties in the neighborhood
Cause if I didn't tell you then another brother would
Your sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
Want to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk
With your rayon, silk or maybe even denim
It really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em
You can break hearts and manipulate minds
Or surrender act tender be gentle and kind
You always know what to say and do
Cold flip when you think your man is playing you
Not cheap or petty, you're ready for loving
You're real independent so your parents be bugging
But if you ever need a place to stay
Come around my way

[Hook]
(To the bridge)

[Verse 3]
Perm in your hair or even a curly weave
Witcha New Edition Bobby Brown button on your sleeve
I tell you come here, you say meet me half way
Cause brothers been popping that game all day
Around the way you're like a neighborhood jewel
All the home boys sweat you so you're crazy cool
Wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
While you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
Going to the movies with your homegirls crew
While the businessmen in suits be hawking you
Baby, hair pumping, lip gloss is shining
I think you in the mood for wining and dining
So we can go out and eat somewhere
We got a lot of private jokes to share
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
I love you, you're from around the way

""Run.. Dee.. Run.. D.. M.. C..""
""Here we go again!"" -] Chuck D*}

""What's it all about?"" (4X with stutter repeats)

[Run]
Livin in the city - the crack the mack and all that
Easy does it, is it was it
The black or white that Friday night
In those racist places - let's get it right
Ah to the maximum, and keep askin 'um
When the city gonna fix where the BLACKS are from
And every day around the way another one got
Bucked in his head - from a gunshot
No chance in advance for the ambulance
Cause he was just another victim of the circumstance
A brother died, the mother cried, it was a pity
But that's how it goes down when you're livin in the city

{*Jam Master Jay cuts ""What's it all about?"" samples*}

[D.M.C.]
Just a hard rock, call him a hard rock
In the metropolis there's no stoppin this
Can't agree with society poppin this
Disagree with the plea when they coppin it
Some men pretend the end will come soon
They gather what they can and them BOOM
You played yourself, you made your wealth;
The deal was dealt - now your health is in question
Three Card Molly, hoodlums - who are we?
Pollution, prostitution, In God We -
- need a solution, revolution, substitution
For the thing's that we're abusing
Pity the city, for the people livin out on the streets
Yo we homeless, the homeless need to eat
There's no progress for the rest
God bless for less

{*Jam Master Jay cuts ""What's it all about?"" samples*}

[Run]	What it is?
[DMC]	What's it all about?

[DMC]	What it be?
[Run]	How you livin HOMELESS PROBABLY
Mandela's free
[DMC]	and they're rollin with D
[both]	In history you cannot see em like they cannot see me
[Run]	The Berlin Wall
[DMC]	It all had to fall
[Run]	They said no but..
[Jay]	""Yo!""	""Yes y'all!""
[Run]	The people that spoke were never provoked
And now it's tumblin down
Freedom of speech for each
[DMC]	Now how that sound?
[Run]	Try to stop me from sayin what I want to say
My funky rhyme I never quit until the break of day
NOW HERE WE GO as I flow and show and kick
[DMC]	Infor-mation, teach and ? reach inside the nation
And be a.. SEER CAUSE I'M REASON WITH RUN
[Run]	And now that the point is out
Let the jam slam my man and tell me
What's it all about?

{*Jam Master Jay cuts ""What's it all about?"" samples*}

[D.M.C.]
I flex my muscle, what I must do
Is bumrush you, FUCK YOU I'll crush you
The Ku Klux Klan is fucked up
And every good man'll understand
Beginnin and winnin, from the first fuckin vocal
I spoke to you, I ain't no joke to you
I do what I want to do
If you don't like what me and my crew is doin then FUCK YOU
What I do and what I done with Jay and Run
None could ever become, to sum it up bum..
Get off my DICK and out my KINGDOM
(Yo yo D tell em where you're from)
Straight from Hollis, Queens
I'm still eatin collard greens and I'm doin the same things
I ain't never goin out suckers..
Punk motherfuckers!

Funky
Funky
Funky (scratched)
Funky (scratched)

[Verse 1]
No one knows, but I've been here for a while
I was sitting in the back playing a low profile
Then like expected, well my name would be paged
""Would the rapper Dana Dane please come to the stage?""
Well I slid my seat back still cool, relaxed
Stood up on my feet, gave a tilt to my hat
To the front I walked, yes, still unnoticed
Up on the stage all the eyes would be focused
Then from the left the girlies caught their breath
And said, ""There goes the Dane.  He sure looks Fresh""
Now a posse clocked me saying they could rock me?
Mad 'cause the girlies called and they flocked me
But that didn't phase me
They must of been crazy
Forget about the guys, see, I came for the ladies
And to grab the mic, right?
Hold it tight, like
Recite a hyped type rhyme that I write
And if I may and if I might
Give a little bit of myself tonight

[Hook]
(funky)
Just a little bit of Dane tonight (funky)
Makes you feel alright (ain't it funky)
Just a little Dana rocking you tonight
Makes you want to hold on tight (funky)

[Verse 2]
Now, mic in hand and the people cheered me
""One, two.  One, two. Can everyone hear me?""
""YES"" (audience shouting)
So let the party begin
As Clark cuts the record like a swordsman
To a worlwide rhythm that I'll be sporting
Dropped on point by producer Fresh Gordon
I came here to share my lyrical flair
Dana Dane Forever, rapper extraordinaire
Now girls flocked in numbers
And they cry my name
Saying, ""He's the [?]"" and ""We love Dane!""
I couldn't resist. Yeah, I blew them a kiss
""That was for me!""
""No it wasn't you ...""
Hey, no need to fight, so I blew them another
A fella on the side said, ""F the mother""
But I told him, ""Don't mess with me
You know who the best to be
Listen to the radio, your mother requested me""
I've got a talent, a style, I'm gifted
Those who riff, well, it's time you get lifted
But I didn't come here to fuss or to fight
But to give a little bit of myself tonight

[Hook]
Just a little bit of Dane tonight
Makes you feel alright (ain't it funky)
Just a little Dana rocking you tonight
Makes you want to hold on tight (funky)
Just a little bit of Dane tonight
Makes you feel alright (ain't it funky)
(one, two, three, four, hit it)

[Verse 3]
Well, well, well, the party's heated now
There's no reason for you all to be seated now
Guys, girls do the latest dance move
Those who can't dance well bob to this smooth move
I drive [?] straight up [?]
Is it R&B or cold hard hip-hop?
It doesn't really matter, just have a good time
You better get yours, 'cause I'm sure to get mine
You never thought the Dane would be this large again my brother?
Bring it on up, I'll sign your album cover
But hold your girl 'cause I think she's jocking me
Can't you tell by the way that she's clocking me?
Well, at least she's got the right idea
And we can get busy when I'm finished here
'Cause she knows how to get things done right
Just get a little bit of the Dane tonight

163,1494,Public Enemy,Can't Do Nuttin' For Ya Man,20,1990-12-22,"

[Verse 1]
Runnin' for your life, by the knife
Runnin' from your wife, yikes!
You should've stuck with home
Your mind to blow your dome
It was you that chose your doom
You built a maze you can't get through
I tried to help you all I can
Now I can't do nuttin' for you man

[Hook]
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You got all these people on your back now
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
Flavor Flav got problems of his own
I can't do nuttin' for you man
Go lean on Shell's Answer Man
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You jumped out of the jelly into a jam

[Verse 2]
Make ya love the wrong instead of right
Not a thief cat burglar through the night
Cop told your girl her name was Shirl
About a rooftop crime to steal her pearls
Uzi down the bullets in the gun
Just microwave themselves a ton
Then you tried to help them all they can
But they couldn't do nuttin' for ya man

[Pre-Hook]
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
They couldn't do nuttin' for you man
Yo G,, listen

[Verse 3]
Flavor Flav is the sun
Public Enemy number one
Gotcha runnin' from the gun (pow)
Of a brain that weighs a ton
Can't face my facts that's on the shelf
Cause you want a hand out for your wealth
Eatin' welfare turkey out of the can
I can't do nuttin' for ya man

[Hook]
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You want six dollars for what?
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
You better man kiss my butt
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
I'm busy tryin' to do for me
I can't do nuttin' for ya man
That's the way the ball bounces, G

[Outro]
Bass for your face
Yo man
I can’t do nuttin'
Nuttin' for ya
I tried to tell ya
Rock that shit homey
Yo G
I ain’t tryin to here that
Kick that shit
You on welfare
Your mother got gold nipples
You got a rip in your couch
Wash your butt
(Kick that shit)
(laughing)

164,1495,BWP,Two Minute Brother,21,1990-12-22,"

TM = Tanisha Michelle
L = Lyndah

Intro:
[L]
Is this all you got?
One minute and you go pop?
You's a big disgrace
I aughta mush you all  in your face!
Telling me lies; you a real good lover
You a Two Minute Brother

Verse 1
[L]
I hate guys who talk a lot of shit
How they last long, and got good dicks
Talking shit: I'm the best lover
They all Two Minute Brothers
[Man]
No I know you can't be talking to me
'Cause I be swing long all night long
Know what I'm saying?
I'll turn your vagina stupid
[L]
See, I'm the kind of bitch that loves to be fucked
Trimmed, tucked, stuffed, and sucked
Up in my ass, deep down in my throat
So we can get busy, but jimmy wear a raincoat
He said
[Man]
Goddam that shit sounds dope!
Look no further, hoe, I'm the pope
Like religion, nasty or nice
You got to give me some pussy like a sacrifice
I got the full night, stretching after twelve
Like a burnt offering going straight to hell
'Cause I'm a pump you up, cold split your clit
Then let you cum in my mouth while you suck my dick
Then I'm a turn you over, belly up bitch
And lick that ass right where you shit
[L]
Well needless to say, I took him back to my house
Took a quick shower, rinsed out my mouth
My starving ass, my shit wet as hell
I had to do the right thing
[L & TM]
Take a Massengill!
[L]
We lay back coolin' drinking Hennessy
When he said
[ Man]
Keep it same to intervene
[L & TM]
Lift 'em up, spread 'em out
[L]
I'll have something on!
The beautiful was cold three inches long
Now I'm pissed and I'm ready to bitch
But my cunt's so horny, I don't give a shit
'Cause I'm one nasty ass bitch
And I need something up in my clit
I only got half of his, I'm still ticked
Aw, what the hell, just go for it
[Man]
(grunt for 10 seconds)
I'm through!
[L]
Is this all I get?
Is this supposed to be good dick?
Damn, you said you was a good lover!
But you a Two Minute Brother
Nigga, I ain't even bust a sweat
Not to mention, I ain't paying yet
I was about to be cool, but why did I bother
'Cause his shit shriveled up like a Vienna sausage
Now I'm hot, I got an attitude
It's time for dinner, I'm serving seafood
On your knees, motherfucker, let your tongue stroll!
Push upon that bitch until you hit my flow
And ladies, beware of those talkative brothers
Chances are, they're Two Minute motherfuckers
[Man]
Damn, maybe your shit broke!
I know you ain't been talking about me
'Cause man, shit, I was so far up in that ass
I was out your back
I don't know what you talking about baby
'Cause if my dick wasn't good, then why was you hollering?
Huh?
Why was you hollering?
[L]
I was hollering to keep from laughing in your face!
[Man]
Not all the time?

[L & TM]
Throw that girl, throw that girl, kick it
Throw that girl, just kick that shit
(4x)
Yeah, girl!

Verse 2
[L]
Most us girls do it and do it
And I'm the kind of girl that throws my back into it
Now here's the type of man that we can't stand
The one who always holds his thing in his hand
Talking about it all the time
Lying, and saying it's about size nine
Always got his hands between his legs
You know the kind, the one who always begs
The one who claims to be a real good lover
Usually, he's a Two Minute Brother

Chorus
(6x)

Outro:
[L]
B.W.P. In effect once again for all you females across America
For all those too short, two inch, all talk, no action
Two Minute Brothers

165,1498,Main Source,Looking At The Front Door,24,1990-12-22,"

[Verse 1]
We fight every night, now that's not kosher
I reminisce with bliss of when we was closer
And wake up to be greeted by an argument again
You act like you're ten
So immature, I try to concentrate on a cure
And keep lookin' at the front door
Thinkin' if I were to evacuate
You'd probably be straighter than straight
And wouldn't have so much hate
Cause you don't know the pain I feel when I see you smilin'
And when I roll up you start wilin'
So I front like everything's hunky-dory
But it's a whole different story
You don't like the fact that I'm me
I don't put on a show
When it comes time for you to have company
And your friends don't understand your choice of man
They speak proper while my speech is from a garbage can
But regardless, you shouldn't have to be so raw
I'm lookin' at the front door

[Hook]
I'm lookin' at the front door
Baby, I'm lookin' at the front door
I'm lookin' at the front door

[Verse 2]
And when you're with your friends, I glide to the side
Until the spotlight is mine and never sabotage a good time
But when they're not around, the fights commence
I'm the one you're against and it doesn't make sense
Cause I'm the one that you claim to love for life
But all I get is gray hairs and strife
And I can play some ole stuck-up rapper role
And get foul every time you lose control
But that's not my order of operations
So I should win an award for lots of patience
Cause that's all a fella can have
With a girl who's shootin' up his world like Shaft
And I don't think that I can take it anymore
I'm lookin' at the front door

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My friends always tell me how I'm lucky to possess
The best looking girl in the whole U.S
But every time you scream, you blow your finesse
Tryin' to dis the Professor
Twenty-four hours of acting sore
Sometimes I wish you'd come down with lockjaw
So I don't have to take in the breakin'
You treat me like a burnt piece of bacon
It seems like just two years
Back when we were bonded and not pierced
But now I keep itchin' to jet
Sitting' in the chair just to stare, set to sprint
Yo, sweetheart, you better take a hint
I say it now like I said it before
I'm lookin' at the front door

[Hook]

166,1538,EPMD,Gold Digger,14,1991-01-05,"

*scratching* Brothers, things done got too far gone (tell em bout it)
We got ta let the girls know what they gotta do for us!

[Verse One: Erick Sermon]
Oh what the heck, let's get married and have a son named Erick
No big deal, no sweat
Hmmm, I was in for a big surprise
And when I saw the judge hammer pass my green eyes
Brainlocked, my whole damn head was malfunctional
Cause I forgot to co-sign a prenuptial, agreement
Now her case is hard like cement
I have no files on all the money she spent
She has a car, nineteen ninety brand new Jaguar
Fly kit, with chrome rims that's five star
That she bought, when I was away on tour
Hittin' my bank account, gettin more and more money
She got paid, it wasn't funny
Talkin to myself - oh you big big dummy
Just my luck, that I'm stuck with a marriage
And a baby, who lays in a gold carriage
Now I can't leave, if I do she gets half (not the cash)
Oh yes, the whole damn bash of money
So I chill, and act so sweet
Kiss her feet, can't picture bein in the street
So I give a fake smile, and a fake laugh
Fake everything so I can keep all my cash
Fake talk, like I love you so much
But wishin, she gets hit by a Mack truck
Next time, if there's one I'll know
That most women strictly out for the dough
They're called gold diggers

Cause she's a gold digger (3X)

[Verse Two: Parrish Smith]
The P had a close call, quiet as kept I dated this
""Flyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy girl""
Yeah, and almost got vicked
She had green eyes, thunder thighs, and a def body (so what cha sayin)
Top it off, she drove a black Maserati
Chrome kit, with a smile I couldn't resist
I tapped E on the shoulder and said, ""Yeah I gots to get this""
(P cool, she couldn't be a gold digger)
Not with that smile and that stupid boomin figure
Til one day, she spent the crazy dough
Ten G's on Levi's, cold went Rambo
But then she smiled, gave me a back massage
Gassed my head up, and said (oh P you're so large)
Like a jerk, I went for the line like a fish
But she was far from dream girl, and more like a death wish
She likes to sit back, lamp, walk on plush rugs
Whip my five-sixty,sip Moet and bug (so did you flip?)
Tried to but she cut me off
And said, ""Guess what?"" (what) ""I'm pregnant"" (pregnant? damn)
Yeah and the child is yours
So to fellas, who wanna keep they cash
Or beware of the jack hammer and the helmet that glows
Cause she's a gold digger

Cause she's a gold digger (3X)

[Verse Three: Erick Sermon, Parrish Smith]
[E] That's why, men in the 90's must watch themselves
[P] Cause ladies of the 80's got hip and went for self
With the new divorce laws, which entitles them half
[E] That means the house goes
[P] The car
[E] You and half your cash
[P] What a price to pay, but if you play you pay
Cause women of the world they got smart today
They flash a smile and profile
[E] A pucker with a strut
[P] Try to move in
[E] Knock the boots
[P] And got stuck, with alimony payments
[E] Time to meet Judge Wapner
[P] You try to flip and cut, but she smiles cause she gotcha
You get a flashback to wedding, when you vowed the vow
Said the two deadly words
[E] I do
[P] But look now, you lost the house
[E] The car
[P] Eatin TV dinners in a one bedroom apartment
[E] Boy you picked a winner
[P] But what goes around, comes around
[E] That's why she wheels the Benz
[P] And you ride Greyhound
Oh, just your luck, they on strike
Take off the wedding band, put out the thumb, time to hitch-hike
And the more you walk the pain from your corns get bigger
(Now you know)
Not to mess with a gold digger

Cause she's a gold digger (repeat 3X)

[P] Yeah EPMD's in effect, DJ Scratch runs flex boy
Hit Squad in effect in the house

[E] Large!!
Yeah, she get half

Play that funky music, white boy I can't hear you, say it
Play that funky music say it, say it, say
Play that funky music, white boy it, come on
Yea, a little bit louder
Now come on, come on

Stage 2—Yea the one ya' wanna listen to
It's off my head so let the beat play through
So I can funk it up and make it sound good
1-2-3 Yo—Knock on some wood
For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious
Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious
I'm an effect and that you can bet
I can take a fly girl and make her wet

I'm like Samson—Samson to Delilah
There's no denyin', You can try to hang
But you'll keep tryin' to get my style
Over and over, practice makes perfect
But not if you're a loafer

You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls
Soon—Oh my God, homebody, you probably eat
Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it!

Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music Come on Come on
Play that funky music white boy Let's do it

VIP. Vanilla Ice yep, yep, I'm comin' hard like a rhino
Intoxicating so you stagger like a wino
So punks stop trying and girl stop cryin'
Vanilla Ice is sellin' and you people are buyin'
Cause why the freaks are jockin' like Crazy Glue
Movin' and groovin' trying to sing along
All through the ghetto groovin' this here song
Now you're amazed by the VIP posse

Steppin' so hard like a German Nazi
Startled by the bases hittin' ground
There's no trippin' on mine, I'm just gettin' down
Sparkamatic, I'm hangin' tight like a fanatic
You trapped me once and I thought that
You might have it
So step down and lend me your ear
'89 is my time! Yo, '90 is my year
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music Come on, Come on, I
Play that funky music white boy can't hear you

You're weakenin' fast, YO! and I can tell it
Your body's gettin' hot, so, so I can smell it
So don't be mad and don't be sad
Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can call me Dad
You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure
Let the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure
So come up close and don't be square
You wanna battle me—Anytime, anywhere

You thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong
So come on, everybody and sing this song

Say—Play that funky music Say, go white boy, go white boy go
Play that funky music Go white boy, go white boy, go
Lay down and boogie and play that funky music till you die
Play that funky music Come on, Come on, let me hear
Play that funky music white boy you say it, say it
Play that funky music A little louder now
Play that funky music, white boy Come on, Come on, Come on
Play that funky music

169,1549,D-Nice,Crumbs On The Table,25,1991-01-05,"

(Is that a turntable? Well get on it, it's your turn)

Who gets laid, the chicken or the egg?
How about the MC that has just been led
To a renegade teacher, preacher then he got stomped
Cause I'm a feature straight from the Bronx
Productions, better known as Boogie Down
If I was a king right now I'd get crowned
The Nice is a teacher, not a prince or a rap lord
I even write my rhymes on a blackboard
To get specific, and probably make you understand
What makes the 808 plan
It's simple, I'm a round it off like this
That's how many stupid MC's I've dissed
But if the commence to try me I won't buy it
I'll look them up and down and I'll say ""Don't even try it""
Cause I can go on and on without breathing
The TR, another form of BDP-eating
MC's like Chunky, moving real bluntly
Shaking and baking MC's like a junky
Fiending, hitting MC's like they was cocaine
Calling them John Doe, meaning they have no name
I'll spin you like a quarter, drink you like water
Hit below the belt with things you never thought of
I lay down the law that I am a slaughter
I roll like a tital wave, so you oughta
Float like a sailboat, move like a speedboat
In water, now watch you soak
Into a rhyme of mine until you hit the bottom
It's heavy like an anchor, it's no problem
For me to just bake you, eat you like a cookie
I am a profressional, boy, you're just a rookie
I'm here to sing a song, but some are not able
Compared to me you're just crumbs on the table

In my prime, more vocal than I've ever been
I'm not an amateur, sort of like a veteran
Split from the bums, arriving from a long trip
Now I'm back to just cold rip
MC's like confetti, eat 'em like spaghetti
I chill for a year and yet I'm still ready
To house MC's, sink 'em like a boat will
I roll heavy, thick like oatmeal
So now you know the 808 is showing
I do damage in just one moment
Here's a little message to those who want to hang out
Just remember that I give pain out
The TR-808 relates to a terrorizer
Never hiding, clever always memorizing
Poetry, history, math, or even paragraphs
I'm not into b-boying, just hoeing
Showing, blowing MC's like the wind does
I might lay you, sort of like a hen does
Cause your rhymes are weak and unstable
Compared to me you're just crumbs on the table

You must think, before you even get soup
I'll put you on the corner and sell you like a prostitute
Like a street whore, make you want more and more
Move you to the side, up and down like a seesaw
Pulling out a gun is uncalled for
But I'm with it, so go for yours
You may even try to diss, but I call it flattery
I pack more volts than a Duracell battery
Charging MC's, smooth like the breeze
Scott made me funky, yo, that was one theme
Or topic, showing I be rocking
Every little city I play I leave a heat wave
Burning up the industry, never try to get with me
I'm the type of person that never needs rehearsing
Just a little sex, a six pack of Beck's
And my room to move about, and a Guiness Stout
To make me feel able, chilling, and stable
Sometimes I'm on the mic, sometimes I'm on the turntable
I'm superb, sort of like herb
A man of my word and I've never been served!

171,1572,Chubb Rock,Treat 'Em Right,23,1991-01-12,"

Nineteen ninety, Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene
With a lean and a pocket full of green
The green doesn't symbolize I made it on the top
But Robocop last year was a shock
The tone of the Popeye cut shook your butt
Kids are screaming; the media says, ""What...
Kind of music is this for you to dance to?""
The man with the plan and the man demands you
Leave the smack and the crack for the wack
Throw the vial in the Nile; keep a smile like that
Leave the knife and the gun in the store
And ignore temptation, sent by the nation
Racial gain causes pain; need a new rep
In your hearts and minds never forget Yusef
Hawkins
And you're walking
You don't just run
Black on black; remember that; it's important
Any way the struggle is won brings forth the fun
No hatred; the summer's almost done
No time for sleep
Jump in your Jeep
And pump up the funky beat a whole week
Beeper goes off yo smash it and trash it
You're too young to be plumped in a casket
Just get your boys and bring the noise
And just swing it
And party people, sing it

Chorus:
Treat me right
I'll treat you good

Kids in the crib want dibs on the big man
""Can he come out? Can he come out and slam a jam?
""I'm his number one fan, yes I am""
All these kids realize that I'm the man
Six foot three and maybe a quarter of an inch bigger
Than last year, but still a unique figure
Rob Swinger, Doc No, Dinky, and Hot Dog know
That I'm a man who was born to have a mic on
Next to me at all time; ready to kick a rhyme
That will keep me out of financial bind
That's why when it comes to fans I'm never mean
Kids on St. James between Gates and Greene
Always say hello, cause I'm a modest fellow
Never try to play a super star that's hollow
Cause if these kids don't go buy our records
We'll be has-beens - and plus naked
So we owe them, so pull out your pen
Sign an autograph; you might make a new friend
So just get your boys and bring the noise and just swing it
And party people in the house, sing it

Chorus

Party people in the house, listen up
I'm the man with the plan and the band rips it up
Peace to Howie Tee, good lookin', gee
Swinger, Hot Dog, Doc No, Bud, Ed Lover, Dinky
Fish and chips with the hippy hippy hips
Before the tune ends, give me some lips (ah!)
Sanity Crystal, my niece
And Lady Kazam, my homegirl, peace
And leave the guns and have fun; out!
And oh yeah, sing it

Chorus

Break

Well coming back
To nineteen ninety
Chubb Rock jumps up on the scene with a lean and a hardcore dream
The dream wasn't crafted to be pornographic
Decency started from the crib, plus kids
Don't need to hear all of that on the rap
The strength of my vibe placed Chubbs on the map
Cause authority, seniority goes far
My staff gives autographs plus gives nuff laughs
Read my mic, heed my sight, I'll definitely lead you right
Just treat me right
Peace

Treat me right
Treat me right
Treat me right

172,1574,Candyman,Melt In Your Mouth,25,1991-01-12,"

Mm-hmm...
This one goes out
To all the suckers out there
Who thought I was soft
When I dropped Knockin' Boots
For the ladies
But I'm-a come correct this time
And do something a little bit different
(Who you gonna cook this to, man?)
Mmm, the ladies

Melt in your mouth, not in your hand
The C-A to the -ndy was the M-A-N
I'm like no other man, 'cause you know no other man can
Be an undercover lover and a soul brother man
On the other hand, introduce me to your mother and
I wouldn't be surprised if she's my number one fan
Here I stand a full six-feet-three
And the perfect match has to be when you meet me
Under a palm tree in the middle of the beach
Bring a towel or a sheet like the boots with sand on my feet
After we eat what we brought on the pier
I hear your earrings jingle like a chandelier
As you premiere what you hear is not a simile
But it's meant to be the poetry as me, a K-I-N-G
There'll never be another Candyman
Because I melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Lip smacking good, good to the last drop
If I didn't have to go, I know you never would stop
I'm on the top of your list for the best French kiss
I assist on your one last wish, and since
I'm not the type to fall in love on sight
I'm-a let you hold me tight for just one night
Since I write the rhymes to make the whole world sing
It doesn't mean a thing when you call me the king
And bells won't ring 'til I walk down the aisle
You could smile, but that won't be for a long while
It'll take more than a killer behind to change my mind
I'm not blind, I know the time
See, I'm not the kind to write a rhyme while you laugh
Ha, ha, ha, girl, I get half
So as I see it, you don't need a wedding band
'Cause I melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Thirst quenching, did I mention
Give a chick an inch and she'll want an extension
Pictured on my heiny right behind me is the man of the house
Suggesting that I burn the hell out
You begin to count, but no doubt, you call my cellular phone
Because I melt in your mouth like a snow cone
On and on as the saga continues
Here's another page on the menu
When you see the Candyman, you see me as a hot hor d'oeuvre
And you got a lot of nerve
First come, first served is the usual procedure
After I tell you that I need you
Featured with any kind of line that I think what's best for you
Because I wanna get next to you
Sex with you is just one small part of the plan
Because I melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth, not in your hand
The C-A to the -ndy was the M-A-N
I'm like no other man, 'cause you know no other man can
Be an undercover lover and a soul brother man
On the other hand, introduce me to your mother and
I wouldn't be surprised if she's my number one fan
Here I stand a full six-feet-three
And the perfect match has to be when you meet me

Bring a towel or a sheet like the boots with sand on my feet
After we eat what we brought on the pier

As you premiere what you hear is not a simile
But it's meant to be the poetry as me, a K-I-N-G
There'll never be another Candyman
Because I melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth
Melt in your mouth, not in your hand

Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove
(Can I kick it?)

[Hook: Phife Dawg]
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes, you can!)
Well, I'm gone (Go on then!)

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Can I kick it? To my Tribe that flows in layers
Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times, I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
Yes, the Tribe of the game we're a player
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air
(Can I kick it?)

[Scratched Hook]
Stick up kids is out to tax
And this is how the story goes

[Verse 1]
Brothers are amused by others brother's reps
But the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
Cause in the night you'll feel fright
And at the sight of a four-fifth, I guess you just might
Wanna do a dance or two
Cause they could maybe bust you for self or with a crew
No matter if you or your brother's a star
He could pop you and jet without a getaway car
And some might say that he's a dummy
But he's sticking you and taking all of your money
It's a daily operation
He might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
Mad brothers know his name
So he thinks he got a little fame from the stick-up game
And while we're blaming society
He's at a party with his man
They got their eye on the gold chain that the next man's wearing
It looks big but they ain't staring
Just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
They'll be long gone before the kid recovers
And back around the way he'll have the chain on his neck
Claiming respect, just to get a rep

[Scratched Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ten brothers in a circle had the kid trapped
The one with the hoodie said, ""We'll hurt you""
If you don't run all your jewels and pay
Give up the Rolex watch or you won't see another day
See they were on the attack
And one said, ""Yo, you wanna make this to a homicide rap?
Make it fast so we can be on our way
Kick in the rings and everything, ok?""
The kid was nervous and flinching
And little shorty with the .38, yo, he was inching
Closer and closer, put the gun to his head
Shorty was down to catch a body instead
Money was scared so he panicked
Took off his link and his rings, and ran frantic
But shorty said, ""Now"" pulled the trigger and stepped
It was nothing, he did it just to get a rep

[Scratched Hook]

[Verse 3]
The rep grows bigger, now he's known for his trigger finger
Rolling with troops of his sons like a gangster figure
He's near the peak of his crazy career
His posse's a nightmare, macking jewels and crazy gear
But as we know, the things we do come back
And Shorty's not peeping, others are scheming to counteract
Cause the kid that got shot didn't perish, so
He pulls up in a jeep with tinted windows
Too late, Shorty was caught in the midst
His time ran out, his number came up, and that's it
You know the rest, so don't front, the plan has been upset
Some brothers gotta go out just to get a rep

[Intro: Biz Markie]
Yo V, bring that beat in
Yeah that's aight
Ahhh man!
Yo G, yo Kool G, yo
I'm doin this right here
We got Big Daddy Kane over there
We all gonna do just one part
Because you know, we came a long way
You know, from back in Martin Luther King days, Malcolm X
[Ain't hard to tell] You know, now now that we see
Nelson N-Nelson Mandela's free
We gonna talk about this, is e gonna talk about this racism
Stop that, you know what I'm sayin, we gonna stop that
So G, why don't you just do your rhymin part, and then I'll come on after you
[Aight, check it out, here we go, yo]

[Verse One: Kool G Rap]
I'm tryin hard to explore, I'm not sure
What all the racial war for
It's makin me more sore
I walk through a color blind corridor
Seekin, for peace in the people I'm meetin
Black white and Puerto Rican men are greetin each other
Just like brothers, there's plenty and many of others
You can discover, kids fathers and mothers
A meltin pot, no one felt they got prejudice
Listen I could never assist someone diss this
A landscape, with a dark and a light handshake
Havin fun, without one bein a fake snake
So let's form a rainbow over the mountain
And let's drink from the same water fountain
Let's make our Earth Day a story of
People that walk through the same territories
Color or creed, is no need for a man to bleed
I beleive, we all breathe the same seed
Unless it's diluted, for somethin to intrude it
Then I see your family tree was uprooted
So don't be foolish if you're Jewish or Hindu
The racial manual is the evil that men do
I was raised in a nation of Asian
Hate shouldn't separate Jamaican from Haitian
So if you're givin in your ears I hope your hear me and
Siberian's no better than Nigerian
I bring a rattle to a battle that you see me in
I'm no villain so why would I be killin Indians
My nationality's reality
And yo a prejudiced man is of a devil mentality
These are words of a wise man, wisdom
Take a taste and erase the racism

[Hook: Biz Markie]
The ink is black, the page is white
Together we learn how to read and write
People are black, got people that's white
Let's stop racism, and, let's unite

[Verse Two: Big Daddy Kane]
[Yo yo Kane, why don't you do your part
And then let me do mine and then we get outta here
Go ahead, bet]

In the days of slavery
Some got to run away and many got done away
Inferiority is what some men say
But that shit played out with Kunta Kinte
Then again in the streets of New York
I think of Yusef Hawkins, and I see you'e still stalkin
And when I think of barriers like Bensonhurst
Huh, notice how I mentioned hearse
We got to better this world of prejudice
People, make peace, and learn to live equal
Cause I don't look at myself as a
Coon or a mooley that would have to say massa
You better believe that I'm an asiatic descendant
And I know what's been amended and intended
So let's fulfill and get real, and try to build
A united nation, eliminate segregation
I know there's different strokes for different folks
But I've also acknowledged what hatred provokes
So don't hate me or try to underrate me
Cause I collect ends drive a Benz and live greatly
And we can all live together in harmony
Without thinkin what color is harmin me
If I'm a slave I'm a slave to the rhythm
To E-R-A-S-E the racism

[Hook]

[Outro: Biz Markie]
To the black and the white
The red and the yellow
To all the nationalities
I'd like to say hello
And I hope they stop racism and it's comin from our hearts
Me, Kool G Rap, Polo, Big Daddy Kane, Cool V, and of course
The Diabolical Bizmarkie I hope ya stop racism
Peace!

Seguro que han oído que yo soy educado
Soy un caballerito un chico bien portado
Un joven responsible y siempre bien vestido
Yo no se quien ha mentido

I don't drink or smoke ain't into dope
Won't try no coke, ask me how I do it, I cope
My only addiction has to do with the female species
I eat 'em raw like sushi

No me gustan ternos, mi estilo es moderno
Si me enterno, you me enfermo
Mi apariencia es dura, vivo en la locura
No me vengan con ternuras

So please don't judge a book by its cover
There's more to being a latin lover
You got to know how to deal with a woman
That won't let go
The price you pay for being a gigolo

There's not a woman that can handle
A man like me
That's why I juggle two or three
I ain't one to commit, you can omit that bit
You pop the question that's it
Haber uno, dos, tres, cuatro mujeres
Y la situaci?all?no muere
No es un delito calmo mi apetito
Con un llanto o un grito

So again don't let my lyrics mislead you
I don't love you but I need you
Would you rather have me lie
Take a piece of your pie and say bye
Or be honest and rub your thighs

Well, it's ten o'clock and I'm two hours late
I never said I was a prompt date
But you kept persisting that I meet your parents
Huh, they're going to love my appearance

Ding dong el timbre suena
Tu madre abre, que vieja mas buena
Le digo ¡Hola! Pero no para bola
Que se ha creido vieja chola

Go and serve the food mom
Que tengo ambre
If you don't hurry, me va a dar un calambre
Y usted señor? Why's your chin on the floor?
Sierra la boca por favor

What's this amor, these little huevos?
Esto s?que yo no pruebo

I'm used to good ol' fashioned
Homestyle Spanish cooking
If i try that I'll be puking
Well it's been a pleasure but we got to go
Regresaremos temprano
Cinco, seis, o siete de la mañana

[ VERSE 1 ]
I was proven effective by a clinical test
Because some couldn't come to believe I was the best
So they tested me, and now they in the clinic
They almost arrested me, because I did it
But I didn't mean to do it
But you had to mess with me, and then you blew it
Now you got to chew it, and swallow it all
I guess that's the way that you bounce the ball
Or somethin like that, my mother always told me
Your mother always told me, ""Baby, hold me""
Don't get mad because you don't get g's
And I get extra cheese like pizza
You can't keep your girl because you can't please her
But let's get back to the fact that's been approven
So let me prove it, come on, let's move it

(Come on)
(Yeah y'all, come on)	--] Flavor Flav

[ VERSE 2 ]
I spent time with the rhyme like a person
Rehearsin like a verse in a chapter
Of a play, but I rap to
Not make money
Though you might find it funny
But hey, I do it cause I like it, plus it is constructive
Enriching to the mind, cause it's mentally productive
And I am one who seeks special education
Cause I can't learn from the system of my nation
Or should I say my residence run by dead presidents
Cause my mother and brother and father are
]From the motherland of another land called Jamaica
Some of them say God, some of them say Jah is the Maker
But I say why say and who is to say
Cause you make yourself what you are today
And only to yourself do you have to prove it
So come on, let's move it

(Yeah y'all, come on)

[ VERSE 3 ]
Straight from the heart and a shot to the brain
To the hand on the pen and then flaunt the fame
And fortune, suckers I be schorchin and torchin
On and on to victory, me, I be marchin
Each and every day, reachin out to pay
My respects and checks to everybody that helped me on the way
To where I've gotten, thanks a lot and
Everybody out there buyin records by the carton
Thanks to the banks and thanks to the label
Thank you everybody with my record on your turntable
Thanks to the sellers and the distributors
Everybody thank your moms cause she delivered us
Thanks to your pops, he gave the drops of life
Thanks ot the Lord, the sword, the double knife
That I use to fight evil like I fight suckers
Damn, I like jam, so I wanna thank Smuckers
Thanks to my deejay and thanks to my producer
Thanks to the girls cause you let me seduce ya
Thanks to the posse around the way
And thanks to the fans that paved the way
You're coming to the jams, throw your hands in the air and prove it
Come on, let's move it

(Yeah y'all, come on)

Artist: Salt N Pepa f/ Alpha Omega
Album:  Greatest Hits
Song:   Do You Want Me (Remix)

[Hold up, wait a minute...
Ain't nothin' but tutti-fruity
Get on the floor if ya got that booty
Yo, you got that funky beat
Let's do it, man]

[Yo, we got a little problem
Yeah, we - you and me
You gotta let me know somethin'
I don't know - you say you like me
So what's up?  You know what I'm sayin'?]

You said it loud, and I heard you
Never tried to hurt you
Some say I'm old-fashioned
I like to take my time and do it slow
You know with the flow
But don't try to rush it
So ride it like a horse
And let nature take its course
Get to know each other
Be my friend not just my lover
Share your thoughts with me
Love my mind not just my body, baby

CHORUS
Do you really want me, baby?  Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like

[Ain't nothin' but tutti-fruity
Get on the floor if ya got that booty
Wait a minute...]

Please understand the way I feel
I must have trust or there's no deal
My emotion's ain't to be
Played with or given free
I appreciate greatly
The way you toleratered me
Sometimes I do act flaky
Wouldn't blame you if you hate me
You put up with my butt
When I wouldn't give it up
Yeah, I know that really sucks
But if you wait awhile, I'll make it up

CHORUS

[Yeah, all right
I know what you're sayin', and it's cool but...
Yo, I gotta know what's up, you know what I'm sayin'?
Cuz sometimes when we're alone kissin' and huggin' and things
I feel like, ""Yo, is this it?  Is it really gonna happen?  Yes!""
And then pow! bam! boom! - nothing
Why you teasin' me?]

Don't get me wrong
I didn't mean to turn you on
We haven't known each other long
But this is my life not just a song

This is serious business

[Scratching]

Y'all ready to get hyped or what?
Well right about now The DOC and the Doctor is housing the set center stage, pumping it just like this...

[Verse 1]
A little something for the brethren with intellect to truly understand it
It's like a message from the one who's getting candid
Making a mark on the strength with rhyme ain't like nothing
When you're pumping something that's bumping
Did it, 'cause it's like I had to make one
Better than the last one, 'cause a mistake, none
But something new was needed in the mix to
Make it as lethal, so lethal that I would think you
Couldn't be made to invade certain areas
No other jurisdiction, but that was fiction
As you progress, and you're enlightened
And the better you're writing by never biting you're exciting
To the crowd, club, congregation, or gathering
Homies in the street they'll be thinking you O.G
Smooth, wordy example of how I'm living
By getting his prime, pumping records that'll blow your mind

[Verse 2]
The DOC is dope
I would've been down with rock but I'd be broke
By the punk, I'm opening up my trunk
To reveal, death, living it up, my life is like a story
Yelling it, cause nobody else is telling it
Checking it, always getting paid cause the rap is sort of like a twist
Between what you needed and what I mean
What I mean by twist, now you gotta listen
Never a segment in negative, 'cause I’m employing what you’ve been missing
So in total, this is one of many styles of an artist
Hard it may be, but not my hardest
Just a portion, cup of salty water in the ocean
Rocking it was the notion, it seems I needed a potion
So I asked the Dr. D-R-E could he comply
Looking at me with a grin, he shrugged his head and said ""Why
Would you ask me a question, knowing you knew the answer all the time?
I make the records, you kick lyrics that'll blow their mind""

[Verse 3]
The DOC is looking for a dope beat to lay in something melodic
After 30 seconds Dre looked up and said ""I got it""
Like the dope sound rolling with the dope beat made me rock a dope rhyme
Which was simple cause I'm
Equivalent to the greatest, nobody knew before
Cause I just decided to make myself apparent once more
To deliver to you in order, let's call it a system
A brother tried to play me like a kid so I dismissed him
And now I'm Ruthless by keeping the crowd grooving
It gets so rowdy that you swear your chair's moving
But it wouldn't, it couldn't, it's more a feeling you encounter
When you're rocking to the music of The DOC and
Dre is on the cut so be wary of all movement
But whatever you do, take the time
To enhance the record by making moves like smooth
And I'll keep pumping lyrics, type of music that'll blow your mind

* girls giggling *

[Onyx]
Oh Pete Nice? I'm smoother than him, man I mean
He wears suits and all, you know no disrespect... *incomprehensible*

[Girls]
Yeah right, just a thought (* giggling *)

[Zev Love X]
Heavy D yo, the girls they love me
(* girls crack up *) They love me, I just know it!

[Onyx]
Yea Positive K? He's dip dip divin ??

[Girls]
Yeah right

[Zev Love X]
Yeah LL, yo he might keep the girls +Jinglin+
But yo.. I'm the man (* girls crack up *)
I'm the man, as a matter of fact
Yo, see they laughin at me man

[Girls]
I'm the man!

[Zev Love X]
Yo, that ain't right
Yo, well anyway

By the hairs of my chinny chin chin, gots many plus plenty
String by string, I think I counts like twenty
If you loan me a ear, I'll return it with interest
If not, I'll simply twist the wrist
So listen up closely, with thoughts to recoup me
Cause I hope to gross like ten cent per groupie
Now only if I had two G's per strand
Ask my anchor banker, he understands
I used to wrap my hand around a cold gold can
Someone once said health is wealth, so check self
I gots a perfect check-up, 'cept for a hiccup, roll with no stick-up
How can I keep the goya nectars on my shelf?
Oh boya how I searched for an employer
But before Z. L. Huckleberry Finn was in Tom Sawyer
Now use your imagination, just a smidgen
If I was a bird I'd be a pigeon
Succumb one to crumbs and pizza crust, when every fella can
Eat fresh fish and live fat like pelican
Then again, that's only if your capable for freckles
Or blue eyes -- I settle for Heckle'n'Jeckle
While I chuckle at my man with the cellular phone
The only phone I own's a funky xylophone's tone
Ain't no joy in annoyin high-pitched ringin
We do the tap twist and twitch bringin
Through soul and this cordless thingamajig
Sure as Subroc's clippers etch a clue to your wig
We'll do the gig so make your mind, thumb twiddlers
The pipe, the bowl or us fiddlers, don't riddle us
I'll even ride a bus to the coast if clear
For okay pay, I'll stay here
Now all this runnin round's kickin me right in the rear
And still I'm judged by the hairs on my chinny chin chin
And I'm able to hit a skin (* girls giggling *)
Just like my man Puba Maxwell, so I'm smooth

[Onyx]
Yeah, candy get the job done but yo, I take care of business

[Zev Love X]
{Peachfuzz} Now what's up with this peachfuzz nonsense?
{Peachfuzz} What are y'all talkin about this peachfuzz?
{Peachfuzz} Nah, I just got one thing to say
{Peachfuzz} Ahh man..

[Onyx]
By the hairs of my chinny chin chin, six black hairs
String by string, I think I counts five pairs
That's a little, but still, can I get a thumbs up?
At least for the peachfuzz that sums up
A tidbit, yeah that's it, but who gives a sugar
Honey iced tea besides me
For if, I ever riff, yet and still, ? windmills
So I take time just to kill
I say cute is for a bear, teddy bear like Teddy Ruxpin
Would I be handsome if I pimped in a tux then
Smoked a cigar with some black chinese shoes then
Picked up some friends in my Benz and start cruisin
Huh, that's a dream that I ain't even livin
If that makes a man, surely I'll recommend
I'll stay a toy boy eatin Butterfingers
With Knowledge of Self, and colorin books on my shelf
I wanna grow up, cause maybe if I did then
I wouldn't be treated like a Toys'R'Us kid when
They counts ten upon my chin
By the hairs of my peachfuzz, let's say each was
An inch, psych because I can't pull or pinch
It's a wrench, and I thought life would be a cinch
But anyway, anyhow, let's talk about someway somehow
That I can make my peachfuzz grow out
Really, do I need beard that grows with no pores
Just to be respected and resemble Santa Claus?
Hear this clear, I'm a MAN I tell ya
No dreams or drugs like the slugs will I ever sell ya
A man I am, in the body of a youth
So don't play me like I'm Born Universe Truth Truth
So when I knock at your hearts, let me in
And judge me not by the hairs of my chinny chin chin

[Onyx]
Yeah, that's what we call, pimpin presence yo
Call me tonight, knowhatI'msayin?

[Girls]
(* girls laughing *) You got it

[Zev Love X]
Yeah, you know I eat no pork
So why can't I be as smooth as my man Dr. York?
(* girls crack up *) I see none!

[Onyx]
Yo.. I'm smoother than the bottom of Hammer's shoes
After three hundred spins

[Zev Love X]
No love here
No hair on my chest, but my boy Ak West, I'm just smoother
I'm just smoother

[Girls]
Yeah right

[Onyx]
I'm definitely smoother than y'all just saw

[Girls]
It's about time!

[Zev Love X]
I'm sayin, yo but, I don't want to hear
{Peachfuzz} none of this peachfuzz nonsense
{Peachfuzz} (Can't understand) Peachfuzz
{Peachfuzz} You know
{Peachfuzz} * girls giggling *

[Verse 1: Ed O.G]
I stay hard like an erection
I'm burning, sucker, so wear protection
Now who's next when Ed's flexing?
I'm the bread and you are just a crumb off
Jerking your jimmy but you still can't come off
I'm from Roxbury, the 'Bury, but not the fruit y'all
Don't make me act like where I come from cause it's brutal
Hold my bone in a zone that's neutral
Soon to be large, the whole nine yards, but I ain't souped y'all
Suckers be swearing that their staring is gonna scare me
Look but don't touch and if you do be prepared G
To go out, just like your first day off punishment
Da Bulldogs, Roxbury, and Boston is what I represent
The Black United Leaders Living Directly On Grooving Sounds
At first you didn't know us but now it's like, ""Yo, put me down""
We didn't get in here so you can get in with us
You wasn't down when we was riding the bus
So put on your Adidas and step off
I got to have it

[Verse 2: Ed O.G]
No need for me to run away, brother, put the gun away
You wanna take my life away as if we were in combat
You can buy some new Adidas but you can't buy my life back
Aiyyo, whassup with that? Why is it like that?
Let's stand together y'all, and fight that in our race
To replace waste with a taste, just in case
You can't face the place that you've been put in
If you was my kid, for what you did you'd have a foot in
Right in your ass, another term's rectum
Kids are having kids, they're not parents so they let them
Do things that shouldn't be done
You're not a father 'cause you got a son unless you're taking care of him
Crack is more contagious than rabies
Baseheads broads are having basehead babies
Now how that sound? Not profound
Black people unite and let's all get down
I got to have it

[Verse 3: Ed O.G]
I'm not like anyone else, and in your shoes I couldn't be in
The E and to the D and to the O oh yes be G'n
Da Bulldogs got pull dawg, inciting we be seeing
I don't wanna stand on a corner, I'm MCing
Call me a goody two-shoes who's in the right shoes, B
I don't have to pump jums to clock G's
It's my turn to go and I got the right of way
You gotta fight your way to see another brighter day
But that's another subject, you like it or you love it
Jea-lous? Get jealous, no push but I'mma shove it
But regardless, when times are hardest
I cleaned off the dirt, 'cause they needed a polish
When you're in like food in your stomach, they wanna stick with you
But when you're out like Elvis, they wanna dick you
But hey, that's okay, 'cause we kept on striving
And even when T lost his car, we kept on driving
You had your chance to advance, but you blew it
Now ask yourself this question: Did you like the way I do it?
I got to have it

[Verse 1]
Now everybody wants to know the truth about a brother named Quik
I come from the school of the sly, wicked and the slick
A lot of people already know exactly where it's at
Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack
(Compton) Yeah, that's the name of the hometown
I'm throwing down in the town where my name is all around
The suckers just be havin a fit, and that's a pity
But I ain't doing nothing but (claiming my city)
See, my lyrics I'm doubling up and proving to suckers that I can throw em
I'm passing a natural ten or four or six or eight before I go
Yes, I'm definitely freestyling, all the while still profiling
Never tricks, the DJ Quikster steals the show
So that's how I'm livin, I do as I please, you see
A younger brother that's up on reality
Cause everybody knows you have to be stomping
If you're born and raised in Compton

[Hook]
(Born and raised)
(Born and raised)
(Born and raised in Compton)

(Where you from, fool?)
(Compton)

[Verse 2]
Now Compton is the place where the homeboys chill, you see
But then I found that it wasn't no place for me
Cause way back in the day somebody must of wanted me to quit
Because they broke in my house and cold stole my shit
They musta thought that I was gonna play the punk role
Just because my equipment got stole
But I ain't going out like no sucker-ass clown
They found they couldn't keep a dope nigga down
So here's some bass in your face, muthafucka silly sucker-
Ass clucker, now you're duckin, cause you can't stop a brother
Like the Quiksta, because I'm true to the game
You're lame, and things ain't going never be the same
Cause a nigga like the Quik is takin over
I really don't think I should have to explain
It, oh yeah, I'm a dog, but my name ain't Rover
And I'm the kinda nigga that's feeling no pain
Sometimes I have to wear a bullet-proof vest
Because I got the 'CPT' sign written across my chest
A funky dope brother never ceases to impress
My name is DJ Quik, so you can fuck the rest
I'm comin like this, and I'm comin directly
Cause suckers get dain-bramaged if I'm doin damage quite effectively
Rhymin is a battlezone, and suckers have no win
Cause I'm a veteran from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N
Kick it

(Born and raised)

Hell muthafuckin yeah
Funky dope for the nine-ace
DJ Quik is in the muthafuckin house
Yeah

(Born and raised in Compton)

[Outro]
Yo, check this shit out
Right about now
I'd like to send a shout out to my buddy Teddy Bear
What's up nigga?
What's up KK?
My buddy D
We got AMG most definitely in the house
What's up Greedy Greg and Big Baby Brian cold chillin
Talkin about the Armstrong Pack
Straight got my muthafuckin back
To my buddy NOE what's up, fool
Roche is in the house
My buddy Donzelli
You know what's happenin, fool
What's up Itch
And Tony Lang is chillin
To my nigga Gangsta Wayne
And my engineer Joe gettin busy on the flo'
And last but not least I'd like to thank Shabby Blue
And we out
Peace

Verse 1:
Life is too short but now it's kind of funky
I make the beats for me and my homies
Newspaper reporters and others always ask me
Why I'm X-rated and I rap so nasty
When I was a teen I did nothing else
But pick up a pen and express myself
The things I wrote were obsene and kind of dirty
But mama always said the truth couldn't hurt me
She also said that it would set me free
I guess she was R-I-G-H-T on the nail
Cause now I'm out making my mail
It all started out from a freaky tale
If that's what sells then I'm a stick with it
Short Dog ain't changing, so forget it
You can sell out if you want to, homie
But I'mma stay short but funky

Verse 2:
Don't stop, just call it verse two
It's Short Dog baby from the Dangerous Crew
Not your average everyday fake rap on the micro
I might say something that your mother don't like so
Don't play it loud if she's around to see
But you can play this cause it's rated PG
When I'm rated X I'm just having my fun
I bring a smile to each and every one
But there's a serious side in everything I say
Life is too short for you to wait 'til the next day
Just straighten up your life and you can start right here
Drop the cocaine and the bottles of beer
People always say it ain't right to preach
But take my advice, get wise and reach for the sky
So you can live like a king homie
And I'm a stay short but funky

Verse 3:
You never catch me on the mic rappin' a dance tune
I like it kind of mellow with the sound of the bass boom
The style is mine, I've been doing it for ten
You might say it's simple, but I'm making my ends
See I don't trip on a punk cause I jack him
Too $hort plus the cuss words equals platinum
What would I look like dancing on a stage
I wave my hand and do it like the old days
But some dumb fool want to take it out of hand
With 50 million dancers and a big old band
That ain't me, I'm from the old school
Play the instrumental, get the mic and I'm cool
Cause I'm an Oaktown mack and it's like that, so
It all comes out in my records and my stage show
In my category I'm the one and only
And I'm a stay short but funky

Hey yo, that's it
Baby Jesus

Dog baby from the Dangerous Crew

(Da-da-da-da-da-da)	--] Suzanne Vega
He-he-he-ha-ha-ha...

[ VERSE 1 ]
Daddy's little girl, but not the girl that daddy knew
Daddy never had a clue of what his little girl would do
A drifter, swift to open up and get with ya
A pocket full of dreams, as for my love - forget ya
I never concentrated on the fact that I'm loved, scheme for scheme
And things that would lead me to a pipe dream
Picture it, yes, I'm daddy's little girl
I never asked for nothin, now it's a string of pearls
My chances are thin, could I win with a substance?
A princess with a smile, but my sweetness was sort of grim
I never fought the feelin that I had to be wild
Cause in my mind I was a mature child
But I could't hurt daddy, I played the role
But on the sneak tip, I was massagin his soul
Nikki had to be free, you see, I had to be me
Or life just wouldn't flow through correctly
Being daddy's little girl

(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl

[ VERSE 2 ]
Daddy'd always tuck me in bed and kiss me goodnight
Said, ""Nikki, sleep tight,"" then turn off the light
And when he goes away on a business trip
I flip, lose my grip - party time - ah shit!
Tell the girls, split the duty, one go pick up the booze
My other half, move your ass and go spread the news
The party went on, lasted all night long
Song after song (to the break of dawn)
Then watch some nasty porns in the morn'
My body got warm, hmm - from gettin freaky with Vaughn
Sexin like crazy, my body amazed me
By takin a chance with a man that didn't faze me
A night so hectic, a bit unexpected
Before I made love, I shoulda been protected
Cause now I'm in a jam with this careless punk
And in about 3 months my stomach will be plump
Trouble, yes, I'm in the hot seat now
Tell my pops? No way, no how
It'll break his heart, wreck his whole world
To have to grow up quick - daddy's little girl
(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl

[ VERSE 3 ]
Neighbors asked could he trust me, yeah, daddy loves me
Cause I can feel it in his arms strong when he hugs me
But there comes a time when his angel must spread her wings
So I bow my head and get deep into the swing of things
Sort of raunchy I must be, cause mama knew
Every time I skipped school mama sat home and sang the blues
Now I regret the day that daddy let me out to play
But I'm a woman now, so let's keep it this way
Daddy's little girl

(What daddy don't know won't hurt him)
But I'm daddy's little girl

Hustler, word, I pull the trigger long
Grit my teeth, spray till every nigga's gone
Got my block sewn, armored dope spots
Last thing I sweat's a sucka punk cop
Move like a king when I roll, hops
You try to flex, bang, another nigga drops
You gotta deal with this cause there's no way out
Why? Cash money ain't never gonna play out
I got nothin to lose, much to gain
In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine
I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin right
[something] my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight
So many hoes on my jock, think I'm a movie star
Nineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car
Go to school, I ain't goin for it
Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet
Cause I don't wanna hear that crap

Yo man you know what I'm sayin?
You got it goin on my man, I like how it's goin down
You got the fly cars, the girls, the jewels
Look at that ring right there
I know it's real, it's gotta be real
Man, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life!
Yo man, I just wanna roll with you man
How can I be down?

What's up? You say you wanna be down?
Ease back, or muthafucka get beat down
Out my face, fool I'm the illest
Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis
Got my crew in effect, I bought em new Jags
So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags
All I think about is keys and Gs
Imagine that, me workin at Mickey D's (ha ha ha ha)
That's a joke cause I'm never gonna be broke
When I die there'll be bullets and gunsmoke
Ya don't like my lifestyle? Fuck you!
I'm rollin with the New Jack crew
And I'm a hustler

H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler
New Jack, New Jack..........

Here I come, so you better break North
As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth
I care nothing bout you, and that's evident
All I love's my dope and dead presidents
Sound crazy? Well it isn't
The ends justifies the means, that's the system
I learned that in school then I dropped out
Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout
I had nothing, and I wanted it
You had everything, and you flaunted it
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine, my success came speedy
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox
Every dollar I get, another brother drops
Maybe that's the plan, and I don't understand
But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn
With my posse, out on the ave
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh
Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam
Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block
You wanna journey through hell? Well shit gets hot
Pregnant teens, children's screams
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam
You don't come here much, and ya better not
Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot
I gotta get more money than you got
So what, if some muthafucka gets shot?
That's how the game is played
Another brother slayed, the wound is deep
BUT they're givin us a Band Aid
My education's low but I got long dough
Raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro
Sleep on silk, lie like a politician
My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician
Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe
There'll be another one after me!
A hustler
Hustler
H-U-S-T-L-E-R hustler

New Jack, New Jack......

[LL]
C'mon man

[News Report]
And with the local DBT news, LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
[Mumbling]
But tonight

[LL]
Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
Rocking my peers and putting suckas in fear
Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosion, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop, when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price

[Hook:]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!

[Hook:]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!

[Hook:]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!

[Hook:]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!

Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhummad Ali they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
Cause you know I had beef wit
Why do you riff with me, the maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready cause it might go
BLAAAAW, how ya like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get with, Mr. Smith, don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blasting, outlasting
Kinda like Shaft, so you could say I'm shafting
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!
Breakdown!!!

Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio HUUUH!!!
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I got a new tour
I'm going insane, starting the hurricane, releasing pain
Letting you know that you can't gain, I maintain
Unless ya say my name
Ripping, killing
Digging and drilling a hole
Pass the Ol' Gold

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!

Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill, at will
The man of the hour, tower of power, I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand
That I'm not your average man
When I got a jammy in my hand
DAAAAAM!!!!! Oooooohh!!
Listen to the way I slaaaaay, your crew
Damage UHH damage UHH damage UHH damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy so suckas I'll slay him
Farmers What!!! Farmers What!!!
I'm ready we're ready!!!
I think I'm gonna bomb a town get down!!
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
Cause he gave me the strength to rock
HARD!! knock you out, mama said knock you out

[Hook]
I'm gonna knock you out HUUUH!!!
Mama said knock you out HUUUH!!!

200,1867,Gang Starr,Who's Gonna Take The Weight,18,1991-04-06,"

[Intro]
Knowledge is power, and knowledge can be the difference between life or death
You should know the truth and the truth shall set you free

[Verse 1]
I was raised like a Muslim
Prayin' to the East
Nature of my life relates rhymes I release
Like a cannon
Cuz I been plannin' to be rammin' what I wrote
Straight on a plate down your throat
So digest as I suggest we take a good look
At who's who while I'm readin' from my good book
And let's dig into every nook and every cranny
Set your mind free as I slam these thoughts
And just like a jammy goes pow
You're gonna see what I'm sayin' now
You can't be sleepin'
Cuz things are gettin' crazy
You better stop being lazy
There's many people frontin'
And many brothers droppin'
All because of dumb things, let me tell you somethin'
I've been through so much that I'm such
A maniac, but I still act out of faith
That we can get the shit together so I break
On fools with no rhymes skills messin' up the flow
And people with no sense who be movin' much too slow
And so, you will know the meaning of the Gang Starr
Guru with the mic and Premier raise the anchor
Swiftly, as we embark on a journey
I had to get an attorney
I needed someone to defend my position
Decisions I made, cuz now it's time to get paid
And ladies, these rhymes are like the keys to a dope car
Maybe a Lexus or a Jaguar
Still, all of that is just material
So won't you dig the scenario
And just imagine if each one is teachin' one
We'll come together so that we become
A strong force, then we can stay on course
Find your direction through introspection
And for my people out there I got a question
Can we be the sole controllers of our fate?
Now who's gonna take the weight?

[Hook: Dj Premier]
You can't handle the whole weight

[Verse 2]
The weight of the world is heavy on my mind
So as my feelings unwind I find
That some try to be down just cuz it's trendy
Others fall victim to envy
But I'll take the road less travelled
So I can see all my hopes and my dreams unravel
Relievin' your stress, expressin' my interest
In the situation that you're facin'
That's why I'm down with the Nation
Spirituality supports reality
We gotta fight with the right mentality
So we can gain what is rightfully ours
This is the meaning of the chain and the star
Land is power, so gimme forty acres
Let's see how far I can take ya
Original invincible
That's how I'm lookin' at it
I use my rhymes like a Glock automatic
Any means necessary, I'm goin' all out
Before the rains bring the nuclear fallout
So let me ask you, is it too late?
Ayo, who's gonna take the weight?

[Hook: Dj Premier]
You can't handle the whole weight

[Hook]
It's just another case of that old P.T.A

[Dinco D]
In school I wrote notes and took quotes from Shakespeare
And other types of rhymes to show you that I (care!)
From things like 'together forever' to 'you're my only one' (only one!)
It was special I can say it was a loving one
You would say someone's knocking at my window (knock knock!)
Someone's ringing my bell (ding dong!)
It's about two in the morning
(Yo D, what the hell's going on?)

[Hook]

[Dinco D]
But nevertheless it goes to show my potential
And even though our love was three-dimensional
One (me) two (you) three (your pops), now what am I to do
I had to transform into an educated lad
Going around doing chores for your dad
Playing a duck, wearing sweaters and shoes
Chilling with pop just listening to the blues
And talking to your mom about her love for her daughter
Suggestion to me, that I just oughta
Watch myself (inch by inch!)
Watch myself (and use some sense!)
So I did (hey!) and didn't do a damn thing
But they still complained, so now I sing

[Hook]

[Busta Rhymes]
ROAARRR Busta Rhymes the mighty infamous
Always misbehaving and mischievous
Causing aggravation I'll never pause
Pushing out spit balls through plastic straws
(In class!)
Until I got caught at last for lighting up the courtyard grass
Hey! Teacher, teacher, don't try to flex
(Busta Rhymes 'bout to get a complex)
Hey yo, in class kicked it to this girl Cheryl
(What?)
The teacher tried to throw me a referral
(No No No!)
But not with detention, or nor with suspension
A child wicked and wild that carries ill styles
She suggested I need to go talk to my mommy
Now when she gets home, she's gonna wear out the body
I hate this relationship to mom and teacher
When she reaches home hey yo she knows that I reached ya
Ok, of today I am the new school prey
Between my mom, my teacher, and my dad hey yo

[Hook]

[Charlie Brown]
Ah! Yo teachers hate me, the girls don't date me
Because I'm C Brown (class clown!)
Yet and still, ah, sometimes I chill, yo
Depending on the day and how I feel
Sometimes I leave an apple that's rotten and (brown!)
Nowhere to be found
Thumb tacks on seats, five days a week
A riot in the lunchroom, I gotta get some sleep
But I didn't do it (you did it!)
I'm suspended (you was with it!)
And now it's time
To pay for the crime and I never got caught
Like Judge Wapner (Bam, take 'em to court)
A room of teachers, parents and preachers
A principal and one kid dressed in sneakers
Case of Brown vs the Board (Order! Order!)
Yo twelve, verse one is a slaughter
I pleaded my case, ah, face to face, ah
It was a waste and everyone was in place, yo
Pronounced me guilty you have three hundred sixty four
Days of detention to serve, some nerve
I felt dissed, could be from pissed
The head of the board said ""case dismissed""
As I walked out the room I heard them say
Ayayayayayayayayayay!

I ran like a rebel, in '85
Cops tried to catch me, cause all of 'em said I
Beat up these other men who were bigger than me
Was it cause I'm black and they were W-H-I-T-E
Here I was walking down the block
I seen these two big bikers standing by the biker's shop
They seen it was me so to make theyself feel bigger
One got bad, bold, pointed and called me a nigga
I stuck my finger up, I said ""His mother"" and kept stepping
His friend told his other friend ""Hey Corky let's get him""
I looked to my back, to my surprise
One had a chain in his hand and the devil in his eye
I said ""I'm in trouble, let me think real quick""
I looked down at the ground and got this big fat brick
With no time to waste I put the brick in my hand
And hit the biker til the chain fell out of his hand
Then his friend Crowty said ""Corky are you alright?""
But what he didn't know was he was in for a fight
The right his his jaw, he fell on the floor
The kid I hit with the brick before said ""Don't hit him any more""
I put my brick down, left him on the ground
Everything was cool til the cops came around
They said ""You're under arrest for Assault 2 and 3""
I laughed at the cop I said ""Explain this to me""
He said ""You hit the man with a brick and punched another in the jaw
And left the scene like nothing happened then they called the law""
I laughed in his face, I said ""This don't make sense""
It was two against my black ass, this makes it self-defence
He tried to grab me, so I pushed him on the floor
And ran my black ass home and locked the living room door
I did what any black kid would have did
But to the cops of Suffolk County, I'm known as a fugitive

I had to go to school, I couldn't be late
If I miss another day Miss Cann said I wouldn't graduate
I didn't go a lot, that didn't mean I didn't care
I had to come to school more often to try again next year
Fuck that, I went to school and I tried
You know to hide from the cops to June of '85
I get my diploma and things would be straight
Find out my graduation cops came and tried to put me on the gate
I ran though, with the diploma that I owned
With cops chasing me all the way til I got home
I got away again, why, you know what I did?
I ran my black ass home and to them I'm still a fugitive

Two years went by, me running from the cops
My mom looked at my dad, my dad said ""Son, this has gotta stop""
Dad gave Ma money, she said, ""Son, this is for ya""
I went to Garden City to go get me a lawyer
I went to jail, Monday, I was in jail through Friday
When you're black and you're in trouble man does your lawyer get paid
Then my moms told the judge ""My son's a good child""
Then he laughed at my mother and said ""Then take us to trial""
I told my mom and dad I felt within
If we took Suffolk County to court or trial, I know I wouldn't win
So without a doubt, like any black kid in Suffolk County
K-S-O-L-O had to cop out
To sixteen months in Riverhead
Instead of fighting and wilding, I wrote my records instead
Commissary was books, inmates owed me
CO's would beat me up on shakedowns, but now those suckers know me
And I laugh at those cops who arrest me for what I did
Cause I walked and no longer am I a fugitive

[Intro]
""Yes, this is Miss Renee King from Philadelphia. I want you to give me a call on area code 215-222-4209 and I'm calling in reference to the music business. Thank you.""

[Hook]
Hey how ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you
Hey how are ya doin'
Sorry ya can't get through
But leave your name and your number
And I'll get back to you

[Verse 1]
Once again it's another rap bandit
Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the Day-Glo
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
Knocking on my door, saying, ""a yo yo""
""I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo""
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number
Then I stop to think and wonder
Bout a plan, yo man I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? Take my number down
It's 222-2222
I gotta answering machine that can talk to you
It goes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pos]
Yo, check it, exit the old style, enter's the new
But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a crew
Or should I say flock cause around every block
There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves
And flaunt a nut that's doggy as in dope
But it's not the mood to hear
The tales of limousines and pails
Of money they'll make like a pro
I be like, ""Yo black, just play me the tape""
But at the show the time to spare I just make
But the songs created in they shacks
Are so wick-wick-wack, situations like this
And now I hate they give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask
""was it def?""
And with the straighest face I be like, ""hell yes.""
I slip them the digits to Papa Prince Paul
So I don't go AWOL but yet I know when they call they get

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Party at the dug-out on Diction Ave
Haven't been to the jam in quite a while
Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles
'Stead piles and piles of demo tapes by the miles
All I wanna do is cut on the decks wild
But edition up here by the miles to the center
Reliever of duty, Plug One mosies in
And I be like, ""Yo G, Pos does all the producing""

[Verse 4: POS]
Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny so I make like a bunny, jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin' fly guy
Try to get on my back they force like Luke Sky
Me, Myself, and I go through this act daily
And rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge some jackal always nails me
No matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like
""Yo, I got a tape to play you back at the hotel""
I be like, ""oh swell""
Unveil the numeric code to dial my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone she'll answer the phone
And with the quickness she'll recite like a poem

[DOVE]
""Hey, you done did the right thing, dial up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep
Say, I would love if you'd sing
The tune to Tru instead of fronting on the speak.""
So no problemo, just play the demo and at the end it's break out time
Please oh please don't press rewind cause I'll just lay it down the line

[Hook]

POS:
Hey how ya doing
Sorry ya can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number
And we'll get back to you.. peace

'Yo what's up man, this is Ronald Master down with the Fish Tank

[Sadat X]
Hey baby your hips was getting big
Now you're getting thin you don't care about your wig
Now Woolie Willie got a pair of my sneakers
Wonder where he got 'em cause I hid 'em behind my speakers
The object of your affection is the tree-top connection
Where basically you love to smoke your wools
The crackheads and crack men they come up to my door
I don't smoke jums so what they knocking for
Kids love to feel on you, feds got a seal on you
Street time is limited to days
On your crack card you're getting only A's and C's for come back
Damn it's a shame you're the mighty queen of vials
With a wide-eyed look and a rotten-toothed smile
Used to walk with a swagger, now you simply stagger
From one spot on to the next spot on to the next spot on to the next
Bitch get a job, from me you won't rob
Cause I'll smack you with a hose filled with sand
Now give that to the crack man
You was fly once now you're losing all your fronts
Started off light only tipping woolie blunts
But now you get a a stripe, graduated to the pipe
Took a long pull...hype
Yeah, head crack head crack
You smoked up that stack in a minute you was back
(Hey yo X, wasn't that your girl?)
Yeah I had to drop her
Cause she caught on the plastic and I just couldn't stop her

[Edie Brickell]
Slow down
What I am is what I am

[Lord Jamar]
I knew this girl named Tropicana
She's always juicing
Producing cash from her sexual tasks
She loves men that trick like Halloween and treat
You ain't paid then your grade is incomplete
You've got to flash dollars, to prove her
And when you do she sucks it up like a Hoover
Taking all your papes like inhalation of vapes
Her nasal passage is filled with money, and it's massive
(What I am is what I am)
Well, what you are is a stunt, man, you're on a hunt
And your plan is to take all you can from a man and scram
I've seen your kind before you're not original
Just a sick mixed up individual
Giving up the crotch for a fresh gold watch
Marking off the goods you get going up another notch
Your ways and actions are like those of a savage
If the price is right, then anyone can ravage
Even Monty Hall can have himself a ball if his assets are in order
What's really scary is you're somebody's daughter
So don't come around, trying to make a profit
At the expense of another man, stop it
Cause you see you're the freak show of the town
And what I think you ought to do is

Slow down x7
What I am is what I am x2

[Grand Puba]
As the jewels jingle from the hot young and single little stunt
A forty and a blunt, that's all she really wants
But she'll spend your papes and she'll use up all your plastic
And if you swing an ep you'd better wear a prophylactic
Cause things are getting drastic
Slide up in the wrong one you'll end up in a casket
(Slow down)
Sister, there's no need in speeding
She was doing lays before she started bleeding
What makes a bitch want to act in this fashion?
Pulled more stunts than my man Action Jackson
A real gold winner just like Bruce Jenner
Lay the bitch on the bed and then you run right in her
Puba makes no mistakes
She said, ""Rock me tonight (for old time's sake)""
Picture that
(Slow Down)
You little hooker
Honey got a problem with the bends
Meaning she likes to bend over, and then she spreads the skins
The ho is just ho and that's without no controversy
She can make the bedsprings sing a song of mercy
Come on toots you can take a thousand douche
Scrub that ass and I'll still pass
(Slow down)
You're living foul
(Slow down x2)
Now see it ain't no reason for you to be out here skeezing
Cause it's not the season
So if you want to live foul and be a dumb diddy dumb dumb bitch
Well go ahead
You're living foul

I'd like to give a special shout to my DJ Alamo on the help out
Right by my side

Slow down (repeat 12X)

Open up your Coach bag, bitch, so I can get paid
And take off your G-string drawers

Bend your ass on over and touch your toes;
Hold your breath cause I'mma hold my nose
This dick of mine ain't friendly, baby;
Will it hurt you? Yeah maybe
Probably, because I'm 19 years old;
I fuck hot pussy until it's cold
I ain't a prostitute, but I'll knock the boots;
Women love me, they say I'm so cute
Girls wanna get with me, I'm tender;
A big old butt, and a smile and I'm wit'em
Pussy ain't nothing but a game to me;
Pockets on fat cause I played the freak
So when a ho when a wanna fuck to the pro of a teenage pimp
I wanna see that grip, so ...

Antoine, Antoine's got something here
Ro-roll that window
We have to turn around because I want to shoot you
Park the limousine, in front of the swamp
Then I want to shoot you dauncing on the limousine
With the swamp in the background
It looks like you're in the jungle, okay?

Let's all sing, Pop Goes the Weasel!

[Pete Nice]
Pop goes the, pop goes the windin of the weasel
I see the empty pocket needs a refill

[MC Serch]
I got a squad with a list of complainers
I should have started RAPE:
Rappers Against Phony Entertainers
So we can make it known that we won't get swayed
It's ninety-one son, so somethin's gotta change

[Pete Nice]
Gettin paid to peddle sneakers and soda pop (pop pop pop)
Pop goes the weasel as drawers drop (drop drop dop)
Why not take your top ten pop hit
Vic the music and make senseless ryhmes fit

[MC Serch]
I guess it's the fact that you can't be artistic
Intricate raps, becomin' so simplistic
I gotta strong mind it doesn't have to be spoon-fed
And I can read what doesn't have to be read

[Pete Nice]
So some stay illiterate and feeble, legally licked
You go the ways of the weasel (the weasel)

[Hook: 3rd Bass] (repeat 2X)
Pop Pop goes the weasel, the weasel *3X*
Pop goes the weasel, 'cuz the weasel goes pop

[MC Serch]
Hip-hop, got turned into hit pop
The second a record was number one on the pop charts
For those that get on heart that gotta in the ghetto
Let no one forget about the hard part
Now in ninety-one we got a new brand, a new band
Lookin like the same old Klan
Same old theives that skeez so we gotta make sure
That real rap has got to endure

[Pete Nice]
Why score all my points in one period
Appearin in complex structure like a pyramid
The paper for the media presence
Ya learn lesson from the face of false legend
Stop vexin on the skills, ya ain't originate
The thin ice you skate upon will break and set ya straight
Ate up on the plate, now who's diesel
Not the weasel, not the weasel, pop goes the weasel

[Hook]

[Serch] Ya stole somebody's record then ya looped it, ya looped it
[Pete] Ya boosted the record then ya looped it, ya looped it
[Kurious] Aiyyo, I came from Cali, and they hooped it, they hooped it
[Pete] But now you're getting sued kinda stoopid

[MC Serch]
Boosted tracks get slaps, ya got no haps
To reach all four corners of the map
For kids in Kansas.. to those who speak Spanish
Doin crazy damage so the wack gets banished
Can't manage the truth until you buy a way
Ya ain't quick so ya switch off the exit from my highway
To rest but a crook, had to take a second look
Ever heard of a chef who can't cook?
But the Minister Prime can lay laws
Hey yo, Pete Nice, rip the mic and go for yours

[Pete Nice]
Goes for mine, I goes for mine
Find the Prime won't eat the green eggs and swine
On line like the Serch, in the hoody with the woody
Get a disc or tape, at Sam Goody
Why'd ya run through the doors some left open?
Ropin off the scenes of the crime smokin
I got pub and I'mma nut like a SCUD see
Blowin up, like I'm throwin up a beef patty
Sell-outs run a bout like the measles
No cures, cause pop goes the weasels

[Verse 1]
Strangely enough I've been struck
Affected by her smile
And yo, her style is worthwhile
And knowing that I'm deep like a river
I feel I should give her
Things that those others can't deliver
Contrary to what I had wished
It seems that I've been dissed
But hey, I don't want to miss this
Wonderful opportunity
My boys they try schoolin' me
But see I know what I want
Someone who'll be there for the whole nine
This honey is so fine
But now she's hung up the line
Upset because I told her I'm busy
She mad like a grizzly
And started chewin' my head off
Screamin' that I spend more time with friends
And also, she said I ruined her weekend
I said ""I know the stuff we had planned
But please understand
Right now I'm loungin' with my man""
I guess I didn't realize I'd hurt her
She said I had the nerve to
Just neglect her like that
Then she started bringing up past things
And she kept asking
How come our love isn't lasting
I said, ""Hey baby, please calm down
Cuz I'm still around
And it's for you that my heart pounds
Can I call you later on?
You say I treat you wrong?
But why you flippin' on me?""
She said something else and then click
Left me alone on the phone with the tone
And now I'm lovesick

[Bridge: Dj Premier]
Love sick

[Verse 2]
Relationships can grip with the pain
Arguments in the crib, in the streets, on the train
I'm crazy fed but then still
When she ain't there I feel sad, I feel ill
Frowning cuz I'm down in the dumps
The other night I took her out
So she could shake her rump
But after we were there for a few
Some girls that I knew
Stepped up and asked me to come to
A party they were havin' at their house
I looked at my girl, and yo, she started walkin' out
I said ""Hey love, just wait for a second
And won't you just check it?
It's all a part of makin' records
Those were just some friends in the business
No need to get angry
So listen up while I kick this
And what about the things we discussed
About havin' trust?
What's all this attitude stuff?
Now hon, you know that I wouldn't play you
But time after time, you let your jealousy sway you
Hey don't you turn your back like that
Come on, this is wack
You're heated up like a thermostat""
Then she stepped off in a whirlwind
And I don't know when
Or if I'm gonna see her again
I coulda sworn she was the right one to pick
But now...man I'm just lovesick

224,2096,Ice-T,O.G. Original Gangster,22,1991-06-08,"

[Verse 1]
Ten years ago
I used to listen to rappers flow
Talkin' bout the way
They rocked the mic at the disco
I liked how that shit was goin' down
Dreamt about ripping the mic with my own sound
So I tried to write rhymes
Something like them, my boys said
""That ain't you Ice
That shit sounds like them.""
So I sat back, thought up a new track
Didn't fantasize, kicked the pure
Facts. Motherfuckers got scared
Cause they was unprepared
Who would tell it how it really was?
Who dared?
A motherfucker from the West Coast
L.A. South Central fool
Where the Crips and the Bloods play
When I wrote about parties
It didn't fit
Six in the Morning
That was the real shit

[Hook]
O.G. Original Gangster

[Verse 2]
When I wrote about parties
Someone always died
When I tried to write happy
Yo I knew I lied, I lived a life of crime
Why play ya blind?
A simple look
And anyone with two cents
Would know I'm
A hardcore player from the streets
Rapping bout hardcore topics
Over hardcore drum beats
A little different
Than the average though
Jet you through the fast lane
Drop ya on death row
Cause anybody who's been there
Knows that life ain't so lovely
On the blood-soaked fast track
That invincible shit don't work
Throw ya in a joint
You'll be coming out feet first
So I blast the mic with my style
Sometimes I'm ill
And other times buck wild
But the science is always there
I'd be a true sucker
If I acted like I didn't care
I rap for brothers just like myself
Dazed by the game
In a quest for extreme wealth
But I kick it to you hard and real
One wrong move, and you caps peeled
I ain't no super hero
I ain't no marvel comic
But when it comes to game I'm atomic
At dropping it straight
Point blank and untwisted
No imagination needed, cause I lived it
This ain't no fucking joke
This shit is real to me
I'm Ice-T, O.G

[Hook}

[Verse 3]
Two weeks ago I was out at the disco
Two brothers stepped up to me
And said
""Hey yo, Ice
We don't think you're down
What set ya claiming?""
E drew the Glock, yo my set's aiming!
Dumb motherfucker
Try to roll on me, please!
I'm protected by a thousand emcees
And hoodlums and hustlers
And bangers with jheri curls
We won't even count the girls
Cause they got my back
And I got theirs too
Fight for the streets
When I'm on Oprah or Donahue
They try to sweat a nigga
But they just didn't figure
That my wit's as quick as a hair trigger
""He's not your everyday-type
Prankster.""
I'm Ice-T, the original gangster

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
So step to me
If you think that you're ready to
Got on your bullet proof?
Well mine's going right thru
This ain't no game to me
It's hollow fame to me
Without respect from streets
So I don't claim be
The hardest motherfucker on earth
Catch me slipping, I can't even get worked
But I don't slip that often
There's a coffin
Waiting for the brother
Who comes off soft when
The real fucking shit goes down
Take a look around
All them pussies can be found
They talk a mean fight
But fight like hoes
I'm from South Central, fool
Where everything goes
Snatch you out your car so fast
You'll get whiplash
Numbers on your roof top
For when the copters pass
Gang bangers don't carry no switch blades
Every kid's got a Tec 9 or a
Hand grenade
Thirty-seven killed
Last week in a crack war
Hostages tied up
And shot in a liquor store
Nobody gives a fuck
""The children have to go to school.""
Well, moms, good luck
Cause the shit's fucked up bad
I use my pad and pen
And my lyrics break out mad
I try to write about fun
And the good times
But the pen yanks away and explodes
And destroys the rhyme
Maybe it's just cause of where I'm from
L.A. that was a shotgun!

225,2098,Gerardo,We Want The Funk,24,1991-06-08,"

Excuse me, where have I seen you?
They tend to ask me
A humble answer I give them
As we start to get closer
But then even more so
They all persist on rubbing my torso

I'm Latin
But I ain't wrapping in satin
No, that old disco look just ain't happening

I'm fresh and new
And making my debut
So let me run this information by you

It's true
We outdo
It has become an issue
Love 'em and leave 'em fast
We won't miss you

Its tradition
We're well conditioned
We outlast the competition
So listen
We dont care too much about kissing
No, we know just what youve been missing

We're straight out and blunt
We don't put up with stunts
Baby, you know what we want

We want the funk
Give up the funk
We need the funk
Gotta have that funk

Don't play shy
Don't expect long good-byes
These are some of the rules that we go by
No demands and forget holding hands
Please, not around our friends
We intend to hold on to our image

Don't try to cross that line of scrimmage
Don't say you werent aware
So have yourself prepared
And beware, this is a one-time love affair

See, that's as far as it goes
It's our motto
And you thought you won the lotto
Waiting to claim your prize
You go unrecognized
Huh!
How's that for a surprise?

So save yourself from confusion and sorrow
Don't even think about tomorrow
Tonights the night, enjoy!
We're here to make some noise
Let me hear that high pitch in your voice

We want the funk
Give up the funk
We need the funk
Gotta have that funk

Smoother than James Bond
You wake and were gone
So you wonder what you did wrong
Huh!

Don't be blaming yourself
It's a must that we vanish
Heres the scoop straight to you, but in Spanish...

Oye nena
Rubia o morena
Mi excusa est en mis venas
Soy un simple mujeriego no lo niego ni miento
Soy latino cien por ciento
As que piensa lo bien si no es conmigo con quien es?

Responde de una vez
No te me hagas la importante la dificil o atorrante
Al cabo tengo mas amantes
No te prometo nada saldrs por donde entrastes

Yo no pienso molestarte
As que no me busques
Me sigas, me asustes
Busca otro que te la ajuste

Now there it is
Laid out plain and simple in Spanish
But on tempo
Can't comprehend at all
Confused or in a hole?
Whats the matter?
No habla espanol?

If thats the case
Then no need to worry
Bust out the dictionary
You want some inside info
Wanna know what you're in for
Look up right under nympho

We want the funk
Give up the funk
We need the funk
Gotta have that funk

6 foot 3, 260 and change
Read ’em and weep, a little comedic and strange
Because we can have many friends, at least people that they call that
They use your brain but they're insane because I ignore that
No ego, cause I will be no, platinum big-headed rapper
That don't realize there's two directions on the ladder
You wanna go 'head, walk straight, walk good
Don't blame your sales on retails, thinkin that the store should
Think of reordering about five-hundred thousand
Just be glad of the success you had and you're arousin
Somebody's brain out there, your year's gonna come
You didn't live by the pipe or the gun to be like me
Waitin for my turn to burn
And get a million-five, and a tax return
That be reapin up, and no keeping up with the Jonses
Long live P.E. and ban Guns'n'Roses
New Kids on the Block, stick to pop
No more making black songs, wack songs please stop!
If show business is a woman, I don't trust her
But she's gonna get knocked by The Chubbster

[Chubb Rock]
The Chubbster, a man that came out about 1986
With the help of Dr. Ice in the mix
And even then, kickin lyrics that was quite potent
Howie by my side, with his pesticide for the rodents
I'd flow - get on the mic and say, ""Yo one two""
Test and MC's start fessin
Jettin cause my weapon among the children was my gung-ho attitude
To use my tongue and lash and lick them up
Then pick them up then just fix them up then mix them up with
A knowledgeable man that went to college and astonished
Racist teachers with all the modern preachers
Crack beepers, yes knowledgeable creatures
But that didn't effect, The Chubbster
I'm from Brooklyn, so I have a little hustler
In my blood, when I kick the scam, they all will flock to it
Get my music and bop to it
Gassed my head but I was goin for my doctorate
Or my Ph.D in P-A-I-D, see
I got into the business to get paid not sprayed
With BS which is an acronym for a much larger word
And if preferred, I'll say it
But then again; radio won't play it
Cause they're cracking down on hip-hop
But it will not slow down or stop
Every year it creates a sellout tour
And this year has room for The Chubbster

Conceited I'm not, but convinced I am
Slam a jam that'll scare even the Son of Sam
In Sing-Sing he will sing simple songs to bring
Tears to your eyes, because you deny he's a king
Such as myself, cause myself is on his shelf
As for myself, I went for self cause myself needs financial
Health and wealth like ki's for G's
Cause cocaine ki's is for those that have morphine needs
Veins all ripped up, capillaries all stitched up
A grand a day, hey you slipped up
The Chubbster doesn't believe in the drug scene
Able to make me feel hip? I'd rather wear gabardines
My quarter fill will be my thrill
My Clyde's will collide with my grill, as for drugs that's nil
Not or no, cause Yo! MTV will never see me smokin rocks
McDonald’s and The Box will diss me
Cause drugs can't assist me or assist you
Blood on your tissue that's ill so chill
And when you come back you better come back even harder
Praise to the man upstairs, yes The Father
Positive tip, now dance on the floor
And have room for The Chubbster

[Chubb Rock]
In ninety-one you will find me just
Chillin countin shillings livin it up is a must
A Benz is not needed to portray my wealth
A Jaguar is not a symbol for a star
But Nelson Mandela, is a fellow I consider to be true blue
Long live the ANC, Walter Sisulu
The rest of the people involved, the problem isn't solved yet
But you can bet..
That united we stand, divided it's over
Without us, this planet will begin to nova
And get cold, dark and scary like Pluto
And then who do you call? You know, The Chubbster

Drums Please!

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 1]
Here it is the groove slightly transformed
Just a bit of a break from the norm
Just a little somethin' to break the monotony
Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be
A little bit out of control it's cool to dance
But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance
Give me a soft subtle mix
And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it
And think of the summers of the past
Adjust the bass and let the Alpine blast
Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme
And put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 2]
School is out and it's a sort of a buzz
But back then I didn't really know what it was
But now I see what have of this
The way that people respond to summer madness
The weather is hot and girls are dressin' less
And checkin' out the fellas to tell 'em who's best
Riding around in your jeep or your benzos
Or in your Nissan sittin' on lorenzos
Back in Philly we be out in the park
A place called the Plateau is where everybody goes
Guys out huntin' and girls doin' likewise
Honkin' at the honey in front of you with the light eyes
She turn around to see what you beepin' at
It's like the summer's a natural aphrodisiac
And with a pen and pad I compose this rhyme
To hit you and get you equipped for the summer time

[Hook]
Summer, summer, summertime
Time to sit back and unwind

[Verse 3]
It's late in the day and I ain't been on the court yet
Hustle to the mall to get me a short set
Yeah I got on sneaks but I need a new pair
Cause basketball courts in the summer got girls there
The temperature's about 88
Hop in the water plug just for old times sake
Break to ya crib change your clothes once more
Cause you're invited to a barbecue that's startin' at 4
Sittin' with your friends cause y'all reminisce
About the days growin' up and the first person you kiss
And as I think back makes me wonder how
The smell from a grill could spark up nostalgia
All the kids playin' out front
Little boys messin' round with the girls playing double-dutch
While the DJ's spinnin' a tune as the old folks dance at your family reunion
Then six o'clock rolls around
You just finished wipin' your car down
It's time to cruise so you go to the summertime hangout
It looks like a car show
Everybody come lookin' real fine
Fresh from the barber shop or fly from the beauty salon
Every moment frontin' and maxin'
Chillin' in the car they spent all day waxin'
Leanin' to the side but you can't speed through
Two miles an hour so everybody sees you
There's an air of love and of happiness
And this is the Fresh Prince's new definition of summer madness

[Hook] repeated till it fade out
Summer, summer, summertime

""Once upon a time there was a little boy
Who lived in the deep, dark jungles of Africa
His name was Little Sambo""

They always try to say that coon is me for some reason
(I don't understand, man)
You don't understand?!
(No, I don't know)

[Verse 1: Zev Love X]
My temper, temper's up to like tenward
Switched up with thoughts that I recommend
My nest is flood but thicker is blood
Plus still some stay stud like sticks in the mud
Ibuprofen from new kids keep me from flippin' daily
Yet I constantly slip into thinkin' kinda loony
In my logo you see us?
Whoever said that coon was me?

[Hook: (Zev Love X)]
Oh, no! (Who me?!)
Uh, oh no!
Uh, oh no! (Who me?!)
Uh, oh no!
Uh, oh no!

[Verse 2: Zev Love X]
Holy smokes! I see it's a joke
To make a mockery of the original folks
Okay, joke's over, but still it cloaks over
Us with no luck from no clover
This, irritates X, so goes into my text
Tolerates one N-word complex
Subroc, etched the fuzz of what once was
In eighty-deca, the joke's on cuz
Those on top of my head stand seven thick
Hairs that even if I wanted to I couldn't pick
Pigment, is this a defect in birth?
Or more an example of the richness on Earth?
Lips and eyes dominant traits of our race
Does not take up 95 percent of one's face
But still I see, in the back two or three
Ignorant punks pointing at me

[Hook: (Zev Love X)]
Oh, no! (Who me?!)
Uh, oh no!
Uh, oh no! (Who me?!)
Uh, oh no!
Uh, oh no! (Who, me?)

[Break: Onyx]
Yo, I begs your pardon
But have you ever seen this brother walkin' 'round here anywhere?
That must be missing person
Have you ever saw his face on a milk carton? (Oh no!)

[Verse 3: Zev Love X]
Tricky tricky, must be part of the ""Gas Face"" series
The same one who started black cat bad luck theories
Yeah, he done it, this place, he runs it
And I'm guilty, Alcatraz till four hundred
Judge ye not the unjudged is where he slipped
The real guilty is filthy, he gypped Egypt
Blew the nose right off the Sphynx, now when he inks
Ugly as when our hair kinks, we thinks
Then zap goes the nap, now I gots good hair
If that's good hair then bad's a hood's hair
Comb-twisted dome, braided or faded
The first man played it and now we hate it?
Robbed of our culture, true indeed I bear witness
And recommend this mental fitness
So get this loaded toolie and point it at a ghoul, G
Then ask him: ""Who you callin' moolie?""

[Hook: (Zev Love X)]
Oh, no! (Who me?!)
Uh, oh no!
Uh, oh no! (Who me?!)
Uh, oh no!
Uh, oh no!

[Zev Love X] Yo G, they wanna call me all these names
[Bert] Aha, I know what we can do
[Zev Love X] What can we do?
[Bert] We'll ask someone out there to find (Little Sambo)
[Zev Love X] What you be meanin', G?
[Bert] Okay, pick up a crayon... (Who me?) No, them. (Oh, us?) Yes. Kids, pick up a crayon, look for (Little Sambo). When you find him, draw a circle around him

To the beat Ya'll
Ah yeah
(Ya don't stop)
Sound good to me

[ VERSE 1: MC Breed ]
This sound hard, somethin' funky people gon' dance to
Give the record a second and a chance to
Hittin' people like a scene of amazement
While they slippin' back, my feet is planted in the pavement
Crumble I can never do
So now I'm lookin' dead at you
What are you gonna do?
You listen to the knowledge of a scholar
You say ""How Breed?"" tell em how I holler
I'm the E Double, and I proclaim my name
Straight up good game, peeps all game
I'm like a rhino runnin' through the roughest pack
They figure I'm a trigga-happy nigga, so they step back
Breed, the microphonist
Boot last the longest
The noose's the strongest
It ain't a game, that's plain to see
You listen to the sounds of Breed (and the DFC)

There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 2: MC Breed ]
I never got caught with a kilo
And if you ever do, yo, it will never be with me, yo
Servin' in a Cherokee or maybe it's a GTO
Black-on-black Benzo, I get it at [Name]
Never have to worry bout my posse gettin' jumped
Cause if we ever do, yo TB, pop the trunk
Cause we don't go for playin', when I play go grab a ball
When I'm on the mic I ain't for playin', not at all
Cause I clock 10 g's a week boomin' at my peak
Always seek E sober, but I do get geeked
I can give you a job, a place to eat hearty
Meet your homeboy Marty at a b.o.b. party
Takin' over, barkin' like a dog named Rover (woof!)
I'm pickin' suckers like a four-leaf clover
They're bitin' lyrics on the mic, I diss these cobras
So now they're sayin', ""Eric Breed is gettin' over""

There ain't no future in your frontin'
Ha-ha-ha
There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 3: MC Breed ]
I'm the B, the r to the double e-d and
Down with my homie G-a-s and O.E. and
Suckers causin' static, cause they still be disagreein'
I don't give a - cause I'm from F-l-i-n-t'n
A city where pity runs low
If you ever shoot through my city, now you know
Cause we are strictly business and we also got our pride
And if you don't like it, I suggest you break wide
Suckers steady lookin' for the m-o-n-e-y and
Thinkin' that illegal is the best way, so they dyin'
I ain't got time to see a fiend fiend out
To give up all his money, and he givin' what he got
That's the way I am, MC Breed cannot be different
Never change my ways for the world or the government
If I was the president, then I would state facts
You leave it up to me, I paint the white house black
It ain't no future in your frontin'

There ain't no future in your frontin'

[ VERSE 4: MC Breed ]
Yeah, I got dollars in my pocket, not from rollin'
If I was a fiend, then my gold would be stolen
Put my name Breed on everything I own
And when I get my jeep I'm puttin' 'Breed' on the chrome
Shine it up good, kickin' through my neighborhood
Motorola phone, fat rims and a Kenwood
Quick to get around it, and then I'll have it drop
Simply cause I'm ridin' people think I'm sellin' rocks
But ain't no future in your frontin'

Yo Flash man, drop that, man
Won't you drop that

(Keep on)
(To the beat ch'all)

[ VERSE 5: MC Breed ]
Cruel to the rules of the world
Live my life raw, cause I never liked the law
Wear top tens, on my ass use jeans
Sellin' big 8ths and tit-for-tat to the fiends
Clock much dollars, but I never break a sweat
Time to move out, my posse sayin' (bet)
You got my back, and I got yours
What time is it? Hm, Tear down the doors

Man
There ain't no future in your frontin'
Never was, cuz
There ain't no future in your frontin'

Hey man, let's start this party up, right?

(Beat y'all)
(Keep on)

233,2187,Slick Rick,I Shouldn't Have Done It,13,1991-07-06,"

[Slick Rick]
Well, I'mma tell you a story and I come out bluntly
Born an ugly child; hey, nobody would want me
I used to walk around and get upset and upsetter
Till I figured out ways to make myself look better
As I got older, my awareness expanded
I met this beautiful girl and my wish was commanded
Didn't hang wit fellas cause they started gettin shady
I'd always be wit my girl and ya could call her my lady
I loved her a lot, word up, not going to front, see?
The problem that arose is why on earth did she want me?
Couldn't figure it out, and to make things worst
I was cursed, wit the torment of not being the first
And the first was this fly guy, made me very jealous
Ooh, I think he cheat on me, and talked to other fellas
Two wrongs don't make a right, but any time that we fight
I would call and took a phone and call a girl outta spite
I shouldn't have done it

[Hook 2X: scratched up]
I'm feelin sad and blue

[Slick Rick]
I will to make this right, so director was admirin
I tried to stop my love, but no love was not retirin
To catcher in the rye was near impossible and tricky
Didn't want her in certain clothes, gettin really picky
We got into it again, this time she got to bright
So me preventin a fight, I just stayed out for the night
I had to ease up of the record, all this hot increase
I went up to the parrot, wit a mega vance in vain
This girl came over, she was trucked down extensive
Startin talkin to me, and she was probably quite aggresive
A pretty young thing, she didn't strike me as no ho
So meet my nigga, rude and went on wit the flow
But Joe was gettin hard, without me even knowin
We stepped up back to my van and I could it's for growin
The girl took off her coat her body was no joke
Well, I rubbed it to unzip it, and I went for broke
I shouldn't have done it

[Hook 4X: scratched up]

[Slick Rick]
Now I'm seein, that there's no one to blame
That night when I went home, I felt real guilty and ashamed
Snucked right into bed, I felt just like a shady fella
What made me so unsensitive, how I'm ever gonna tell her?
Shouldn't have cheated, just because we'd always doubt
Endurance, be a man, that's what I had to learn about
How me, I guess I like the wanted secrets that I did
I figure, I'd patch things up and then I'll tell what I did
Then after that, she started actin heaven sent
I found a house spot, let's say she help out wit the rent
So, I bought the ring, it was a good 20 Karat
Then word got back about me chillin at the parrot
So when I got home, I thought she'd just be out to roast
Instead I found this letter, and I found her overdosed
It said ""I had it for you"" but I guess she didn't care
All this wouldn't happen come of me and this fear
I shouldn't have done it

234,2190,Main Source,Just Hangin' Out,16,1991-07-06,"

[Hook]
I'm just hanging out (Repeat x2)

I'm mainly known for the rough raps
But kids steal my lyrics like hubcaps
And eat 'em like stacks of flapjacks like rugrats
Hey, and I get busy over unknown tracks
While the next man flaps his lids like Parkay
I'm skilled in the field, so slide to the side
I'll make a rapper cry, cause I can get some shut-eye
While he's having hard times writing rhymes
So he gnaws on my metaphors and dines on my lines
Which is the reason why I like to hang out and
Hustle with my friends, to get away from pens
And copiers, so I'm Corona bound
To check Drew aka Doc the Butcher and what's going down
And Joe with the Jetta enables us to get around town
He's a clown
Other than that I'm with Joe Burgos
Watch an old Black Caesar flick for kicks
Jump in the wagon and we're outta here without an idea of where
But usually we wind up there
I go over K-Cut's block cause rock cuts is what he blends
Check it, and I like to hang out and hustle with my friends

[Hook]

And I be up in Mt. Vernon, piecing, with CL Smooth and Pete Rock
Making beats that are sharper than cleats
With my man Grippy Grip from the Cafe Black Rose
Checking out videos
And I speak with my man Ralik
On the problems of the weak dumb and meek, my man's deep
Like the kid from the Bridge named the rapper Nas
Me and G collect money in bars
And I run through discotheques like sound
Royal Rich is profound, yelling free James Brown
We rustle up to the discotheque and
Hustle up a storm in a swarm like we on form
Nobody can get with the whereabouts cause we're out
Shuffling feet without a shadow of a doubt
From Flushing to the streets of New York and back
Freshly dipped off the rack, but not the Van Grack
In the park making plans for the night
Everything's right, taking it light
Preparing for the festivities to begin
And every day seems like a day from the weekend
The cooling never ends
And I like to hang out and hustle with my friends

235,2191,Heavy D & The Boyz,Now That We Found Love,17,1991-07-06,"

Now that we found found love
What are we gonna do with it. (x2)

One two, tell me what you got
Let me slip my quarters inside your slot to hit the jackpot
Rev me up Rev me up
My little buttercup
We can tug sheets snuggle up and get stuck
Believe it or not
Here comes the brother with glow
A strugglin', Bubblin' overweight lover hurt prone
So what's it gonna be
Me or the TV
Now let me take time to set your mind and your body free
So why don't you just stretch
Stretch for a sec
Lay by the fire so i can catch a quick rest
Shake me, Shake me
Baby Baby bake me
No need to fake here I am
Come on and take me
Wind your body
Baby move your body
I see you slip sliding
Come on now do it hottie
I'm not quite sure as to what is going down
But I'm feeling Hunky Dory
'bout this thing that I found

(CHORUS X2)
I like the way you wiggle
You don't jiggle
But you jiggle
So hand over your love
Cause it's heavy
Than it'll
Move like a Mover
Sye wanted to groove
So I grooved her
Then she wanted to learn
So we'd be schoolin'
So I schooled her
(Mary had a little lamb)
But not like this
We can toss and turn
Rumble tumble and twist
Then you think you gonna give in
Phantasies relivin'
So lay down and relax
Lover my lady
Lady love of my baby girl
Spread your wings
So we can fly around the world
Harmony charming me your fingertips are callin me
When you drop a kisses
Susie Q you droped a bomb on me
Stretch it
Stretch it
Flex it
Flex it
Gimme the permission
Okey, Dokey
I'll bless ya
Blessin' like buddha
Buddha as the bless
You can lay down on the Lover
Put your head on my chest

(CHORUS X2)
What can we do
What are we gonna do
Roses are red and Violets are blue
Love is good and plenty
If you get plenty good lovin'
Kiss u when your hot u know i got 2 keep u bubbling
Do me right
Do me right
My lonesome dove
Tell me one more time
What is this thing called love
I'm not quite sure
As to what is going down
But I'm feelin' Hunkey Dory
'Bout this thing that I found

238,2217,DJ Quik,Tonite,18,1991-07-13,"

Here we go

[Verse 1]
Yo, a day in the life of a player named Quik
I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow with a head like a brick
And just because I drink the 8, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc-ness
Now this is how we do it when we checkin a grip
Teddy Bear's in the house, so don't even trip
We're bustin funky compositions as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick it to this funky ass rhythm
It's Friday morning, the phone is ringin off the hook *brrrrrring*
And AMG is in the den reviewin' rhymes in his notebook
Or should I say dope sack, because we don't bust wack *brrrrrring*
I pick up the phone and it's the D (whassup nigga?)
He said he's comin down at about two on the dot
So I'm about to rush the tub while my water's still hot
And now I'm soakin, a brother like the devestatin DJ Quik ain't jokin
Fuck with me on DSP and you'll get broken
My name is Quik, but you can call me Daddy
Yo, open up the door 'cause here come Freak Man in a Caddy
Now Freaky's in the El-Dog and Shabby's in the ElCo
And everybody's sippin on a quart (here we go)
D just came with a forty and a quart
In addition to the three that Greedy just bought
But I don't wanna start early, so I just might
Put my forty in the freezer 'cause I wanna get bent *tonite*

[Hook]
Tonight is the night (yeah) *tonite*
Tonight is the night *tonite*
Tonight is the night (yo, when we gon' get bent) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (aww yeah)

[Verse 2]
And now I'm out of the tub, I'm feelin' fancy free
Spray on some Xeryus and put on my Givenchy
Sweatsuit, the gray one with the burgundy trim
And it's a medium, fit me proper 'cause I'm nice and slim
Five thirty on the clock and the sun is steadily sinkin
And I am steadily thinkin about the 8 that I'll be drinkin
You know I ain't ashamed and you know I ain't bashful
So go on and pop the forty so I can pour me a glassful
Hamm is in the bedroom rollin up a stencil
Fatter than a pinky and the length of a pencil
Freaky lit it up and hit it one, two, three
Shabby took a hit and then they pass it to me
(It's the bomb!!!)
Yo, I can feel my senses (gettin' numb!)
Yo, fuck the forty ounce (I need some rum)
I'm chillin' like a villain (here I come)
And that's how I'm livin'
Tonight is the night and I'm lookin' real sporty
Proper Friday evening, and I'm ready to party
Crusher came in with a handful of snaps
Fuck it, let's shoot some craps
(Yo what they in fo') A fin or a half
(Yo shoot that ten, nigga) Don't make me laugh
Hi-C won a dub and he think that shit is funny
But I'm seven and eleven and I'm takin niggas money *tonite*

Tonight is the night (yeah, watch me bust a ho) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (passin' naturals on motherfuckers) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (yo, I'm unfadeable) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (ahh, let's break it down, so I can get funky)

*tonite*

Ahh yeah
Givin' em somethin they can roll on

[Verse 3]
Wake up Saturday morning, and I got a headache
I can't believe that I'm sick from all the shit that I drank
*Last night* Soon as I felt it comin on, I shoulda quit
It's true that a drunk ain't shit
To the man up above to whom thanks I give
I'll never drink again if you just let me live
Mike P spoke to me and I said I couldn't call it
Callin' Earl like a mother while I'm grippin the toilet
I need a 7-Up, because my head is spinnin
Round and round, I think I better sit down
My homey Shot is alright, but I'm feeling faint
I guess he's used to it, but a nigga like Quik ain't
K is on the phone, and Teddy's at the door
And some fine ass bitches comin over at four
(I thought you wasn't drinkin no more) Yeah right
Because as soon as they come, we doin the same ol shit *tonite*

Tonight is the night (yeah) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (straight gettin fucked up, heyyy) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (fuck that pass me that pina colada) *tonite*
(man I don't wanna fade that 8 Ball no mo)
Tonight is the night (that shit be fuckin a nigga up) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (ahh yeah nothin but a party and I'm kickin it)
(what's up Pete and Greg) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (how you livin?) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (hey somebody get that nigga a Genuine Draft)
(yeah) *tonite*
Tonight is the night (and on that motherfuckin note, I'm outta here)
(See-ya) *tonite*

*tonite* (Repeat until end)

We out (What about peace?)
Fuck peace, nigga, give me another brew

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Ice water, watch your daughter
Your mother and your sisters, aunts
Nieces and your wife's ought to
Know, ain't nobody safe when I'm in the place
I'm dropping more bass when face-to-face
Erase haste with the taste of a steady pace
Ain't no time to waste and it ain't no race
You state your case and work your weights
Without a trace... and just wait
For double-black to double back and make that move
Break it to ya, I'ma do ya, and I ain't that cool
Enough to take you plus I ain't just
Here to bust, so you know what: it ain't just
Another brother or another joke with money
Cause I'm giving you something to work with honey
You can feel the heat but it ain't no pressure
When I turn the heat on, the cool breeze'll refresh ya

[Hook]
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?

[Verse 2]
Put it in flow-motion, ice cool with a nice cool breeze
Native-sung native tongue for the young ladies
Dropping rhymes, rocking minds and concubines
Treat it like a king of this hip hop thing that rhymes
Manifest as a vehicle, and see a full
Picture I'm wit'cha, I'll hit'cha with mixtures
And become a fixture inside your heart
Make you feel the pulse of my beat even miles apart
Ain't no mountain high enough, or a valley low
To stop Kool Moe, I got a cosmic flow
I glow like a moon, it dictates your mood
But cool ain't a mood, it's an attitude dude
It's a tone, it's a tempo, a mindset, a rhythm
A lifestyle, religion, it's just how you're livin'
I'm righteously cool while here and hereafter
I'm so cool that I have to ask ya

[Hook]
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?

[Verse 3]
Easy does it, not because it's easy
Turn the heat on and it still won't freeze me
Internal climate control controls the climate
That's why I rhyme at the temperatures I'm at
Usually freeze competitive emcees
And breaks them down in threes, and lights them up like Christmas trees
Fortified with tranquility, to deal with the trilogy
I got the ability for upward mobility
Break calm, genetically athletically mental
Exercising thoughts cause I went through
Party like a trooper, complete mind fighter
And now I'm known, a super elite rhyme writer
Now there's women and millions in dollars and loads
Fly gear to wear as the stage explodes
Role model for the people cause I keep a level head
When I look into the mirror the reflection said

[Hook]
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?

[Verse 4]
I never lose my composure cause I ain't supposed to
I rose for the occasion, thoughts never froze, I chose
A pattering pattern that patterned to the battle zone
You can get rattled home, so don't even travel, roam
Or drift or wander into my vicinity
I'll respond and conk with no affinity
Identity scrape, broken down on tape
And it ain't no escape, and you gets no breaks
I make few mistakes cause I strive for perfection
Head for the hills if I shoot in your direction
Protection's limited, heroic images
Are broken down, hell-bound from the minute its
Image is amplified, I'll be damned if I
Believe the hype of stereotypes, I plan to die
Like a warrior, fight until I'm free
How cool Can One Black man Be?

[Hook]
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?
How cool, how cool, how cool
How cool can one Black man be?

Wake your punk ass up
The MC Eiht's back in the muthafucking house
Kicking the straight gansta shit for teh 9-1
You know what I'm saying, yea

Growing up in the hood, yea boy, 1984
Was the year my peers didn't know what was in store
A little hard head kid came abade
Time to pay my dues, learn the tricks of the trade
And at home, it's the same ass story
Mom's treat me like she don't even know me
But my younger brother's got much clout
I can't take this shit so I bones the hell out
And roll wit the pack of wicked muthafuckas
No shorts are taken, we're down black brothers
A little nigga wit no problems at all
Fucked up and killed my first 8-ball
Quick up the stairs so little sucker stop looking
Stagger to the house so I can collect my whooping
But watch out cause a little nigga's up to no good
Growin' up in the hood

(Chorus)
(""Life ain't nuttin but bitches and money"")
(""Cause in the city you live and let die"")
(""Nutting but bitches and money"")

[MC Chill]
I got hard times and realize, ?(skate)? sometimes I wonder
But it just seems that the hood could took me under
Police sweat my tip and keep harrassing
Trying to lock me up cause I keep on blasting
Community trying to shut me out
But the money keeps flowing and I got much clout
Wit the cluckers, the brother back street punk suckers
Try to break me out fool, you be a short muthafucka
Always strapping, eager to peel a cap
I set up a trap, put your foot to a nap
Cause I grew up fast on the wrong side of the law
So watch me take 2 to your jaw
Don't enter my hood homeboy
Not a robocop, a robogansta, ready to destroy
I take chances cause life to me ain't no good
Growin' up in the hood

(Chorus)
(""Life ain't nuttin but bitches and money"")
(""Where I'm at if you're soft, you're lost"")
(""Nuttin but bitches and money"")

[MC Eiht]
1987, I'm back on the scene, out of jail, I'm legit
And I'm fucking up shit
I'm ready to peel a sucker's cap
And I heard that my hood was making snaps
As I precede to make my riches
Just like the neighborhood kingpin, pimp, and all these bitches
Task force trying to roll deep
But I'm playing these punk fools cheap
Niggas rolled by and try to blast, it didn't work
I seen the bullets flying and fool, I hit the dirt
Bullets fly through the window
Hits my brother, down goes my mother
As I'm rolling, I'm hitting my switches
Looking for the punk ass, sons of bitches
I found them, before I kill 'em, I said you fucked up good
Got ta handle that, growin' up in the hood

(Chorus)

Yea-a-a-a

[MC Chill]
A brother's on the run, I've got a hand in my stash box
Wanted cause I'm serving them the potent fat rocks
And my face is like a household name
Everybody warns their kids about the dope game
But I'm still makin my profit
And the one time just can't stop it
So I keep hiding my face
No time to waste, they got me on the chase
Now the neighborhood's on my line
Cause some punk ass fool had drop the dime
5-0 at my doo' at 8 o'clock
Rush to the toilet so I could flush the rock
Out the backdoor, freeze, I heard a shout
Am I sho', yo I guess I got no clout
But it's murder one, I'm the victim, damn, that ain't good
Growin' up in the hood

Uhh! Put your weight on it
Uhh, and uh, Prince Paul, bring me on and uh
Aiyyo Botch, bring me on and uh
Mad Money Murph just bring me on and uh
Just bring me on, yo

This is a world premier and I'm here
A presentation beyond compare
So MC's step to the rear as I break through
Girls say ooh and then skip to my loo
That means dance as I get smooth with
Poetic perfection that you can groove with
Just like a passenger, hurry and fasten your seatbelt
Cause I'm about to start broadcastin
The words of wisdom, so turn up the system
Loud and clear, I don't want no one to miss one
Word to be heard never blurred or slurred
The preferred is absurd, all the damage that's occured
As I break MC's like a lumberjack
Ain't no comin back, you can't get none of that
I'm not the type of MC to be merciful
So if your name ain't Jermaine take it personal
Cause like a vigilante I'm gonna kill off any
Sucker MC that tries to withstand me
With the mic in my hand I start flowin then
All competition flee and start goin in
The other direction, run for protection
Cause I can burn an MC like an erection
You're too small kid, don't get involved with
The verbal law for the Nation of Islam
Wisdom I speak makes your head nod
Showin I got the power, and that's from bein born the God
But many doubt my Knowledge of Self
But they're just illiterate, so I don't consider it
Feedin off poison that's pollutin their mind
And that's the reason I don't swine
I gotta maintain, accelerate my brain
And god damn, it's hard being the Kane

Give it to me! C'mon!
C'mon! Uhh!
Give it to me! Give it here!
Give it to me! Yeah..

This is the proper way man should use ink
But you're at your brink and your rhymes are extinct
Just like a dinosaur, but you never find a more
Cause mine'll keep sellin on wax like some kind of whore
Let me inject this, flow of electric currency
For all the party people preferrin me
And spectatin like a tourist, cause you never
Saw this style of rap kickin like Chuck Norris
But this ain't Kung-Fu, no I just brung you
A style, that phony MC's were too young to
Digest, when I manifest, you adolescent
So sit back, relax, be glad you had a lesson
And this one's for your listenin pleasure
Somethin for all the bitin MC's to treasure
Just like a diary, for you to admire me
Before you're put in the Dead Poet's Society
Cool as a draft, droppin math in a paragraph
I laugh as the wrath break in half, your whole staff
But many MC's were able to retreat
Runnin like an athlete, but I got bad feet
So I don't chase ya, nor do I wait to face ya
Nah it ain't in my nature
I just rip shop, flip-top, and watch MC's get dropped
As I manifest in hip-hop
Rhymes I construct are tough like a Tonka truck
And just like lightnin they struck
Down on all the toy MC's that annoy
That's how I build and destroy
The poetic printer, rough rhyme inventor
With a groove so smooth you can't help but get into
So I'm advisin competition to flee
Cause I can bake an MC like Chef Boyardee
Holdin my own on the microphone
Cause I break bones just like sticks and stones
So let it rain let it rain as I put em in pain
God damn, it's hard bein the Kane!

Give it to me! Get up!
Come on! Uhh!
Give it to me! Come on!
Give it to me! Yeahhh

Put in a pause, because here's the holocaust
Above all laws, in effect and all yours
Cause I came to blaze a taste of bass of grace
A replace, erase the waste without a trace
My vocabulary will just have you very
Dazed and amazed so I fear no adversary --
That means competition
They can't even touch this, even with ammunition
Break out the gauge and go into an outrage
And I'mma still blow up the stage
Cause this is a death threat, but don't let your sweat get
In the way of your vision don't be missin when I get set
To go on a rampage, start a one man rage
Total destruction as I rip up the damn stage
And leave it in ruins from the damage that I'm doin
To prepare the atmosphere, as I put you in
The mood for the Smooth Operator to start this flow
And so..
I crushed and crushed and stomped the comp that tried
To get fly and face the ace I put em in place
Proceed em, retreat em, defeat em, delete em, and feed em, and eat em
And all the rest of that good stuff, cause I don't need em
Only one survivor can remain
And god damn, it's got to be the Kane!

Get up! Give it to me!
Give it here! C'mon!
C'mon! Give it to me!
Uhh! Put your weight on it

Arm me with harmony
Dave, drop a load on 'em

[Verse 1: Treach]
O.P.P., how can I explain it
I'll take it frame by frame it
To have y'all all jumping, shouting, saying it
O is for other, P is for peoples', scratch your temple
The last P, well that's not that simple
It's sort of like, well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missing here
You get on occasion if the other party isn't gaming
It seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then left feeling real mellow
You get home, wait a day she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it’s her girlfriend’s or her cousin’s house?!
It’s not a front, a F to the R to the O to the N to the T;
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
(Oh that’s why she’s scary)
It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at
Who think it's wrong cause I was splitting and co-hitting that
Well if you do, that's O.P.P. and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

[Hook]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (Every last homey)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (All the homies)

[Verse 2: Treach]
Well, for the ladies O.P.P. means something different
The first two letters' the same but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean, I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhyming with ""cleanness"" or ""meanness""
I won't get into that, I'll do it ah sorta properly
I'll say the last P hmmm stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me
Now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife
And you just had to stop a toast cause he looked just that nice?
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
He had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway!
You couldn't be seen with him at all and still you didn't care
Cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finished, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And then y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do'.
Now don't be shocked cause if you're down I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P. (O.P.P.) I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

[Hook]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (Every last lady!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (All the ladies!)

[Verse 3: Treach]
A scab tried to O.P.P. me
I had a girl and she knew that. Matter-of-fact her and my girl was partners that
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment
Bust it
That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
Cause after that she kept on coming back and catching feelings
I said, ""Let's go, my girl is coming so you gotta leave.""
She said, ""Oh no, I love you, Treach!"" I said, ""Now, child, please!
""You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go!""
I said, ""Now look you chooses stairs or chooses the window
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have brought your heart
Cause you know I was OPP, hell from the very start!""
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round running off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him!
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. messing with
Him or her for sure ain't going to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy I'm with it

[Hook]
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (This whole party!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah you know me!)
You down with O.P.P.? (Yeah you know me!)
Who’s down with O.P.P.? (This whole party!)

Goes around
What comes around goes around

Sittin here reminiscin back to high school
Wwhen everytime I see you, girl, you know that I drool
Day-dreamin in class thinkin what would I say
When I saw you, but you never looked my way
It started freshman year and lasted straight to the 12th grade
I have to give it to you, though, you was top-shelf, babe
I asked myself time and time again: what was it
About me that made me treat me like a buzzard
I speak to you in the hall and you ignore me
You keep walkin and talkin like you never saw me
You didn't have to conversate with me, I can say that
It woulda made my day if you just had waved back
I used to buy you candy, lollypops and gum drops
I even pack a extra-sandwich in my lunch box
You're treatin me like dirt and everyone in the school knows
You call me out my name and crack jokes on my school clothes
If anyone could make you feel good, girl, I could
But you give me that look like you don't wanna be bothered
But that's okay, just keep on frontin, see
Cause one day I'mma make it, and you'll be wantin me
Been tryin hard ever since I graduated
To make it big, and yes, I finally made it
Been doin shows, videos and tv
Now everywhere you go everybody knows me
Now the tables have turned and now it's me you're hawkin
Now I turn up my nose, and keep on walkin
You see, ladies marvel me in clubs frequently
And you make it your duty to come and speak to me
Rememberin how she played me in the past
Yeah, we can talk, I'm in a rush, please make it fast
And we can start off with all the men you been with
And don't come poppin that just-a-friend bit
Remember how you used to diss me and play me out, how
Come you got so much stuff to talk about now?
The word's around town that you're on the money tip
But sorry, I can't do nothin for ya, honey dip
So pardon me as I make my way to the dancefloor
And over to the bar because that's what I came for
Cuties pamperin me with champagne and roses
As I think to myself: thank God for showbiz!
Everywhere I turn girlies throwin me rhythm
Drinkin and thinkin who will be my victim
Here comes that girl that used to diss me
She whispers in my ear could she come home with me
Yup, get your coat and we could shoot north
Took her to the crib, and cold knocked her boots off
After i got it, yo, I never did call back
Thinkin how she used to front like she was all that
It's a new game, and the odds are in my favor
She caught the vapors and nothin could save her

What comes around goes around
You know what I'm talkin about
What comes around goes around
What comes around goes around
What comes around goes around

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Remember the days when I was walking and talking
Doing what I gotta do (doing what we wanna do)
Off into my walkathon missions (why?)
Cause the brothers that I knew with the rides drove by
On the nice sunny days looking down the road
Seeing beautiful girls with the car loads
Yeah, yeah, yeah they were screaming, wish I had a little ride of my own
But since I don't that is my sobb story
My missions will continue as I keep on stalking
My stamina was dying from the constant walking
Right before the moment I began to call to my man Brittle
Who had a sunroof and all
I thought he would've noticed my dying
When I yelled his name he yelled beep and kept driving
Now in my heart there grew a big hole
Cause my little, little, little toe started rubbing on my insole
It was a fidgety burn and then I said wait I got pride
It's time to get my own ride
I came up with a scheme and got paid
I had no other choice but going down with the trade
When I got my chance though I got kind of stingy
Yep, cause I got my cherry Pathfinder
Now I'm feeling good cause I'm off my feet
Men and little squalid dogs running up on the street
And they're saying
My name is Sharina (My name is Busta)
My name is Tonya (My name is Busta)
My name is Diana (My name is Busta)
Now what do you take me for the little local pushover
No shame in my game cause that's how I got dissed
And when I return the favor everybody gets pissed
And now I am the man feeling all the glory
And when you rise down and gone just remember that

[Hook: All]
I know you and you know me
I know you and you know me
I know you and you know me
It's the sobb story, the sobb story

[Verse 2: Charlie Brown]
Red light, green light 1, 2, 3
Here comes the hop along kid Charlie B
I'm constantly moving with my walkman kicking
My bunions are crying, beaving, picking
Please! Please! Get into the vehicle
I stopped at Davis Ave
Thinking I'll see a cool brother to give me a ride
(Sorry Charlie) was the comment replied
I didn't forget about the girl in the Sidekick
The rub-a-dub system and the spoiler kit
She drive by with the posse, ooh-ah, ooh-ah, ooh-ah
(Hey Charlie Brown, where's your car?)
Well I haven't purchased it yet
The smoke from the rubber burned up to my neck
Girls with Gucci and their friends with Fendi
Won't allow a walker to get friendly
Just a beep-beep and occasional wave
The tables turn, now she got played
Lunch time, Marty and Dion
Johnny Juice, Giggles, Troy and Dequan
Sitting and waiting for a ride to Mickey D's
I snack by the crackerjack just to relieve
Stress it's a mess, I decided to work
But its hard to work when your boss is a jerk
I swept floors and strived to get mine
My amigos with Dinco D, Milo and Busta Rhymes
Rag top, kickbox, yellow and brown
Who's the clown? Remember that...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dinco D]
Now I remember Rob when he first got his Saab
Didn't have a job and his car was a mob
Of brothers he never knew from jack
And when his car went flat they wouldn't jack
And when his car was in the shop they wouldn't stop by
To even say hi on the reply
But back came Rob to the same old gang
(Yo what's up do y'all wanna hang?)
Yeah sure they say on the quick fast
(By the way anybody got money for gas?)
Nah not me, I don't, don't ask
I got it come on (watch out we gonna crash)
But wait now Rob just walking like me
The D to the O, in the middle I-N-C
And some say envy, I stay on empty
And now he just walking my sobb story

[Intro: Scarface]
I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Oh, that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

[Verse 1: Scarface]
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Four walls just staring at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleeping with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't living right
But I ain't going out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweating and blood starts coming out my nose
It's somebody watching the Ak'
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watching my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a 'caine like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""
But fuck that shit! There's a nigga trying to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every 20 seconds got me peeping out my window
Investigating the joint for traps
Checking my telephone for taps
I'm staring at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playing tricks on ya

[Verse 2: Willie D]
I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, something ain't right
I feel I'm being tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lying
I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's going down, let's get this shit over with
Here they come just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfucking trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go, because I'm paranoid
I keep looking over my shoulder
And peeping around corners; my mind is playing tricks on me

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Praying for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is looking at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift while I drive
Having fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I died then my child would be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feeling lonely
My mind is playing tricks on me

[Verse 4: Bushwick Bill]
This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbing little kids for bags
Till a law man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was going down we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I'd be seeing in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Dropping them motherfucking B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody, from punching on the concrete
God damn, homie
My mind is playing tricks on me

Come give me a kiss under the missle toe

""First I have to boom boom the bass like this..""
""And then I..""

[Ed O.G.]
Now this is the meanin of a Bug-A-Boo
It's a person who's constantly BUGGIN YOU
Never givin you no room TO BREATHE
On you like skin, or a shirt WITH SLEEVES
A person that constantly wants to be around you
It could even be your moms or pops when they hound you
Just someone who's always botherin you
If you was a plant, they'd be continously waterin you
Sweatin you like - heat
Let's say you are the (?), and they are the sheets
Always on you, and wrapped around you
As if you were lost, and they just found you
They never get the picture
No matter how many times you diss 'em, they still wanna get witcha
Continously callin never givin you a rest
A Bug-A-Boo's just like a fly..
Nothing but a pest, and I suggest
That you step, why?

[Hook]
Cause you're a Bug-A-Boo, you're buggin me (I'm buggin who?)
You're just a Bug-A-Boo, you're buggin me (I'm buggin who?)
You're just a Bug-A-Boo, you're buggin me (I'm buggin who?)
You're just a Bug-A-Boo..

[Ed O.G.]
Now girls, there's that certain guy that just be tippin
On you like clothes and I suppose that you be dippin
In his kicks, cause he's a stupid dick
Sappy givin you this and that, so you can feel happy
Yeah you might be happy but you're sick of him
Because he's on it, and you wanna get rid of him
But he's sweatin you, don't knock it cause he's gettin you
Everything you want, so you can get fly
You say, ""Bug-A-Boo jump,"" and he says, ""How high?""
Hey, just get paid, cause he's payin you
And don't call him by his name, call him a Bug-A-Boo

[Hook]

[Ed O.G.]
Now everybody knows a Bug-A-Boo or was a Bug-A-Boo
You mighta had to bug a few or even fell in love and knew
That you was buggin a person, never cuttin no slack
Cause everytime you called them they was like ""I'll call you back""
Now a girl can whip a guy, and he can become one
He'll be callin you'll be stallin cause he's stupid a dumb one
But it goes both ways, and as a matter of fact
A girl can catch her man cheatin, and still take him back
So to all you Bug-A-Boos who got the blues and really want it
Without you Bug-A-Boos we couldn't say that you were on it

261,2444,Hi-C,I'm Not Your Puppet,20,1991-09-14,"

[Intro]
Heres a little story i'd like ta tell
About a situation guys and girls know very well
Everything is fine and dandy and you love it
'Til dope make you treat another person like a puppet

[Verse 1]
Now I talked to this girl for about two weeks
And I've been many places and seen many freaks
But this girl was just fly, her body good lookin
I was a fish just flappin' and she was like hook'n
I got to know her by spending some time
She gave me things of hers for some things of mine
Everything was goin' good, couldn't nothing go better
Anything she wants to do, Hi-C would just let her
Wasn't like them other brothers trying to screw her up
I would take her to the mall, and straight cold do her up
Have a treat, and when she by my side
I want the girl to look good when she rollin' in my ride
But three weeks later I noticed a change
Somethin' wasn't right she was acting kinda strange
Took some money out my stash, and stuffed it in her purse
You think if things is gettin bad, man, it's gonna get worse
Well, looks like I got myself a few problems
But me, being Hi-C, you know I'm gonna solve 'em
She ran out the house, and drove down the street
Stopped to buy some crack from my homeboy Pete
I couldn't believe what I was told
He gave the freak double-up for a thick piece of gold
So I creeped up on on the girl, and said ""yeah, I caught ya""
""And by the way, where's the link I bought ya?""
Now this girl must've lost her mind
Scrapping up dough in some things of mine
I wanted to beat her. Better yet stomp her
Break out the 12-gauge and full of buckshot, pump her
But I said, nah forget it, I'm a chill
This girl need help, she's mentally ill
She got to trip' and started spending my grip!
So I just had to rip the pipe out' her lips
She cried, ""Crawf, please gimme some money""
""I promise I'll stop, please, come on Crawf honey!""
I felt sorry for the girl cuz she's being misused
It was the crack and the devil, riding to abuse
This relationship just ain't gonna last
Girl, you gonna have to get rid of your past
Cause yeah, you're on my dick dick ding a ling
Tryin' to tie my arms and legs with a string
My money? mmm hmm, i know u love it
But let me tell you one thing I'm not
I'm not your [puppet]...

[Interlude 1]
So listen up to what we say because...
[Smoke primos cuz you thought it tastes good]
Yo, girl, get off my [ungh]
Man, I wouldn't touch that- [you, why?]
And with your wrinkled [ooh!] I can't be your lover

[Verse 2]
Hopped out the bed bout three o'clock
Stumbled to the door when i heard the knock
I thought ""man, now who in the heck could this be?""
When i got to the door she said ""Crawf, it's me""
""I thought we're supposed to go out this week""
""Not tonight girl, I'm 'bout to go back to sleep""
But by being a big booty, heckuva freak
Before I closed the door, she blocked the way with her feet
She pushed her way in, didn't use much force
She said I know we goin' out, I said ""yeah, of course""
I'm staring at this girl wonderin' if she alright
Cause where in the heck we supposed to go
At this time of the night
But the only thing that was on my mind
Was jackin this girl for her big behind
She thought that I forgot that she was the one that was smokin' rocks
I looked at the girl and i said ""babe, you know what Steve said?""
""Your butt ain't nothin but a base head""
She disagreed. She said ""stop lyin'""
Her feelings were hurt, so she broke out cryin'
I said baby you gotta help yourself
Don't expect help from anyone else
This relationship just ain't gonna last
Girl, you gonna have to get rid of your past
Cause yeah, you're on my dick dick ding a ling
Tryin' to tie my arms and legs with a string
My money? mmm hmm, i know u love it
But let me tell you one thing I'm not
I'm not your [puppet]...

[Interlude 2]
Three days later... [hooked and all]
You gotta give me some now
[It's all because of me]
All right, stop fussin' [thinking to myself]
Who knows where the f___ her lips been

[Verse 3]
The girl was dumb... she was straight out sprung
If dope was a rope, then her soul was hung
Well one day, I went to see my DJ
The grand, incredible, wizard Tony A
Got to his house, then I knocked on the door
The fool didn't answer, so I banged once more
I wondered, where in the heck he was at
So I jumped off the porch, then I fell to the back
He was there, cuz I heard the system thumpin'
Went up to the window, jack's moves was bumpin'
I grabbed a crate just to peek through the window
The girl I kicked it with was getting played like Nintendo
Jumped in the window and I said ""what's up?""
Tony had her hyped up, he was driving her nuts
She seen my face, and she started to scream
I said ""shut up girl, you know the routine""
Popped the tape in the deck and we rocked back and forth
From the east to the west, the south and the north
I got tired, and said ""man, I quit""
Tony A said, ""Crawf, look at this chick""
She grabbed a rock, and I started to flip
Baby wanted to smoke, man this girl was a trip
She said ""Yo. Check this out, man""
""My dope smokes in a pipe, and it melts in my hand""
Girl, you just a fool, your life is going too fast
I know this relationship just ain't gonna last
Cuz, yeah, you're on my dick, dick, ding a ling
Tryin' to tie my arms and legs with a string
My money? mmm hmm, i know u love it
But let me tell you one thing I'm not
I'm not your [puppet]...

[Interlude 3]
Well I bought her a chain, Reebok boots and a skirt
And she [clocked it]
Then she went in my pants, and she took my keys
And stole my bucket

[Outro]
Yo, the little story that I just told
About a girl who's living life with her head that's swole
Dope ain't me, Hi C can't cut it
Girl i know you love it
But I'm not your [puppet...]

[Intro: Mr Lawnge]
Van Damme!
Let me see what kind of flavor I want
Hmmm. Do I want, vanilla?
Or do I want a taste of chocolate?
Nah. I want something different, I want something slamming!
What's the slammingest flavor out this month?
Let's see...
Yo black!
(Hmmmmm?)
What flavor are you?
(Listen...)

[Verse 1: Dres]
For a second, I reckon, I got ya double checking
Then again when to your needs did I beckon?
Hold me only if you wanna get naked
Play me for the crowd only if you wanna wreck it
The name is Dres, like silk I get slick
Drop rhymes like a basehead Bic flicks
Constantly, yes it's me
D-R-E-S
So yes, I guess, unless ya fess
You can get down to serious business, with this
I never boned a honey that I didn't like
I never saw a mile that I couldn't hike
I never had a spliff to make me choke
I never had a pocket that was broke
Hate no one but love only a few
Franklin, Grant and yeah mom duke
I run buckwild for self or with the crew
But then again, huh I thought you knew
Now I hear a voice, is it what you want?
I hope it is kid you're the flavor of the month

[Hook]
I heard you got the fever for the flavor [Repeat x3]
Somebody said you got it going on
I heard you got the fever for the flavor [Repeat x3]
Hurry up and get a scoop before it's gone

[Verse 2: Dres]
So you got the fever for the flavor of the other
Chocolate, sasspirilla, or is it you like another
Flavor in my socks, to the curly locks
Black Sheep rolling hard and knocking peons out the box
Never have I ever never ever felt much better
Did the whole nine, on the tenth I was no wetter
Ready and I'm eager, eager as a beaver
On the radio and good to go says your receiver
Not to be the boldest or the oldest nor the wackest
Neither am I needest or the newest or the blackest
Just a brown fellow who's not afraid of Jello
To the people of the world I would like to say G'day
Had to wait a while but the while has been waited
Never gave up hope in myself nor debated
Didn't shed a tear when I wasn't picked
Cause I got a cone now, want a lick?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dres]
Now I catch a number when before I caught a glare
Now I give a pound when before I gave a stare
Now I guess I kinda got it going on
I get a wake-up call on the norm
I used to try and push a demo now I have a Coupe
That's a bit more than a little, but then not quite a few
Funny how they find you when they told you get lost
Tell me why you're gritting when you have no dental floss
Wasn't my loss, thought you were the boss?
You never knew how much the Sherbet cost
Forget it, I never sweat it
Your girl will give me play I'll wet it
It only happens yes because you let it
Now everybody wants to play my phone
I see em with a spoon, I see em with a cone
You never knew I knew it but I knew you would pursue it
Hurry up and get a scoop before it's gone

265,2471,Salt-N-Pepa,Let's Talk About Sex,22,1991-09-21,"

[Intro: Punch it, (Hurb)]
Yo, I don't think we should talk about this
(Come on, why not?)
People might misunderstand what we're tryin' to say, you know?
(No, but that's a part of life)
Come on

[Chorus 1]
Let's talk about sex, baby
Let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex
Let's talk about sex

[Verse 1]
Let's talk about sex for now
To the people at home or in the crowd
It keeps coming up anyhow
Don't decoy, avoid, or make void the topic
Cause that ain't gonna stop it
Now we talk about sex on the radio and video shows
Many will know, anything goes
Let's tell it how it is, and how it could be
How it was, and of course, how it should be
Those who think it's dirty have a choice
Pick up the needle, press pause, or turn the radio off
Will that stop us, Pep? I doubt it
All right then, come on, Spin

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Hot to trot, make any man's eyes pop
She use what she got to get whatever she don't got
Fellas drool like fools, but then again they're only human
The chick was a hit because her body was boomin'
Gold, pearls, rubies, crazy diamonds
Nothin' she ever wore was ever common
Her dates, heads of state, men of taste
Lawyers, doctors, no one was too great for her to get with
Or even mess with, the Prez she says was next on her list
And believe me, you, it's as good as true
There ain't a man alive that she couldn't get next to
She had it all in the bag so she should have been glad
But she was mad and sad and feelin' bad
Thinkin' about the things that she never had
No love, just sex, followed next with a check and a note
That last night was dope

[Bridge 1]
Oh, hey, ooh, ooh, ooh, take it easy now
Uh, alright

[Chorus 2]
Let's talk about sex, baby (sing it)
Let's talk about you and me (sing it, sing it)
Let's talk about all the good things
And the bad things that may be
Let's talk about sex (come on)
Let's talk about sex (do it)
Let's talk about sex (uh-huh)
Let's talk about sex

[Bridge 2]
Ladies, all the ladies, louder now, help me out
Come on, all the ladies, let's talk about sex, all right (x2)
Yo, Pep, I don't think they're gonna play this on the radio
(And why not? Everybody has sex)
I mean, everybody should be makin' love
(Come on, how many guys you know make love?)

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
What we have here is subject to controversy
A three-letter word some regard as a curse, see
He may fiend and have a wet dream
Because he seen a teen in tight jeans
What makes him react like that is biological
But scheme of gettin' in those jeans, is diabolical
But of course he does it, and she gives him rap
And before you even know it, they jump in the sack
As a matter of fact, sometimes it’s like that
But anyway, ready or not, here he cums
And like a dumb son-of-a-gun, oops, he forgot the condoms
“Oh well,” you say, “what the hell, it’s chill
I won’t get got, I’m on the pill""
Until the sores start to puff and spore
He gave it to you, and now it’s yours

[Chorus 1] (x4 with fade out)

When in Love (3X)

When in love you might cuss and fuss and fight
But at the end of the night, everything is alright
Drips of tears turn into drops of sweat
It'll only get as wet as I let it baby
I love hard, I've done some effed up things
From kicking them in the Nerfs, to throwin away his ring
So if you love me, love me and stay with me
But you can walk if your plan is to play me
I'm not embarassed, nor am I ashamed
To say once in the past, I've been gamed
But that was then, and this is now
And there's no way damn it, there's no how
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above it's not a fad
You'll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what I'm speakin of

When in Love

When in love you do things that are strange
Look back and say, ""I must have been deranged!""
I'm talkin like pickin your lover's nose
Cooking his food and washing his clothes
And if you thought that was goin too far
What about givin him the keys to your car?
You could be partyin and havin a ball
But you stop and check your messages to see if he called
How about sittin in the house all night
Waitin for the phone to ring -- that ain't right!
But you do it anyway cause you love him to death
And if he was dyin, you'd give your last breath
You gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above it's not a fad
You'll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what I'm speakin of

When in Love (2X)

When in love you go out your way to please him
Wait outside his job, hope that you see him
And guys buy girls some serious things
Like two-seater cars and diamond rings
I know what happens, she got you strung
Guess it doesn't matter long as you're having fun
Love'll make you do some crazy things
Meet a married man and then have a fling
Like Babyface said, ""Love makes things happen""
It's most important, to hear what I'm rappin
Someone in love better take your time
Cause love sometimes make one commit crimes
Although you gotta go through the good and the bad
Pray to the one up above it's not a fad
You'll do some crazy things when in love
Those in love know what I'm speakin of

Awww yeah uh uh
Feels good

(Kid)
The time has come to enjoy myself
I've left my problems up on the shelf
The work days over and I've got it made
Like Johnny Kemp said I just got paid
And I'm ready to mangle young man single and free
Ready to get busy, down to party hardy and have a good time
All I need is a partner in crime
Call up the homies and hope they might
Say they down to paint the town red tonight
Look in the closet and pull out the hype gear
Pull up the hightop fade and I'm outta here
Do a disco on a party of some kind
Hope that I would find myself a good time
Before I'm through and the night is done
Man I'm gonna have some fun

Chorus:

Ain't gone hurt nobody we just dancin ya'll
Ain't gone hurt nobody out there on the floor
Ain't gone hurt nobody we just dancin ain't we
Ain't gone hurt nobody gonna give you more
O yeah yeah

[Play]
If you lookin' for war step on the dance floor
Check your coat and troubles at the door
Cause we sure you gonna see us smile today
The problems of the world seem miles away
The only thing that matters is a good time
That can be had with the help of a good ryme
The DJ's hype well and up to par
Uh-oh there goes a cutie at the bar
So I stroll on over to her and say hi
And tell her I'm the P-L-A-Y
And would you like to dance awhile
I'll do anything to see your smile
See my job is to tell you how
After a couple of songs I'll require
Having fun well I ain't done
The best is yet to come

(Chorus)

(Kid and Play)
The music's hype and if it's alright with you
I wouldn't mind spending the rest of the night with you
No kidding babe we could make some noise
You and your girls me and my boys
Just feelin like a night filled with pleasure
We could take it slow with no presure
Enuough respect,you won't regret
This will be a night you won't soon forget
And thats a promise from me to you
Take my hand girl I'm gonna see you through
You don't stroke me as a woman that fronts
Here's your chance, you only live once
I wanna here you say what a blast Kid
We sure had good fun while it lasted
Hang out with friends, hit the skins
Next week we're gonna do it again

I'm million dollar nigga, not the million dollar man

Nigga, I smoke weed sometimes with the street hustlers
But you can cope some dope wine, and toss some 40s like a motherfucker
I think it's.. I'm about to move some fly shit up
I play it from the Old to New School, trick school up
You hooked to my style like a fiend on coke
It's like the moral junky you get, the mortal junky smoke
I don't slip, but I stalk with the whip
Cause I'm vocally pimpin, while I'm proud I'm gifted
But yo, once I'm pimpin, the whores all know I got a gang of them
Who gives a fuck if she claims somethin?
Cause late at night, I got the creeps on a whore
I throw a penny at the window, she be ready to go ""OOOHHH""
I wouldn't treat like a sneak, I treated her just like a queen
Take straight to the Mongareen, and did the wild thing
Yo, then I went back to the set
And if my homies ain't stossin' out, I'm takin' none of bitches
Until it's gone if my homies can't have some ""Sure baby""
What's the matter baby, I thought you wanna have some?
Cause you whore, is not our whores
And incase you didn't know, your bitch swings low
Flipped into a spot on a strip, break a fool off a mega somethin'
So don't trip cause I'm a South Central player and I gotta admit it
Last fool tried to fade this, we got him ass kicked

Who steal the rag from the flag and comin' up much faker
Cause I say: about ten years from now, I'll be finicially stable

To see my Ups and Downs, to see the caps I peeled
And see the people who are still, down for the crown
You know, I have to give a shout out to the underground ""That was fly""
So players, let's just chill cause things are better
And remember like mostly boy, nothin' changes but the weather

I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
[Q] Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?

Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On job remaining, no home training cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word

One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must I go to gain respect? Um
Well, it's kind of simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it. Look at how they act
Off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll score 'em with decorum
Proper. What you say Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop

NC, y'all check the rhyme y'all
SC, y'all check it out y'all
Virginia, check the rhyme y'all
Check it out. Out
In London, check the rhyme, y'all

Here come the drums, music
Alright, alright, yeah, yeah
Alright, alright

Bass in your face, not an eight track
Gettin' it good to the wood
So the people give you some of that reactin' to the facts
That I kick and it stick and it stay around
Pointin' to the joint, put the Buddha down
Goin, goin, deep to the roots
Ain't givin' it up, so turn me loose
But then again I got a story that's harder than the hardcore
Cost of the holocaust, I'm talkin' 'bout the one still goin' on
I know where I'm from, not dum diddie dum
From the base motherland, the place of the drum
Invaded by the wack diddie wack
And fooled the black, and left us faded
King and chief, probably had a big beef
Because of that now I grit my teeth
So here's a song to the strong
'Bout the shake of the snake and the smile went along
With that, can't truss it

[Break: Flavor Flav]
You can't truss it

You can't truss it
Yo, let them know --] Chuck D

[Chuck D]
Kickin' wicked rhymes like a fortune teller
Cause the wickedness done by Jack
Where everybody at divided and sold
For liquor and the gold
Smacked in the back for the other man to mack

[Break: Flavor Flav]
What?
Wicked man, wicked man
Get back, step back, kick it man

[Chuck D]
Now the story that I'm kickin' is gory
Little Rock where they be dockin' this boat
No hope, I'm shackled, oh plus, gang tackled
By the other hand swingin' the rope ""god damn""
Wearin' red, white and blue, Jack and his crew
The guy's authorized beat down for the brown
Man to the man, each one, so I teach one
Born to terrorize sisters and every brother
One love who said it, I know Whodini sang it
But the hater taught hate that's why we gang bang it
Beware of the hand when it's comin' from the left
I ain't trippin, just watch your step
Can't truss it

[Break: Flavor Flav]
Can't truss it
Yo, let them know --] Chuck D
Can't truss it
Yo, let them know --] Chuck D
Can't truss it
Yo, let them know --] Chuck D
Can't truss it, can't truss it
Can't truss it, can't truss it

[Chuck D]
And I'll judge everyone, one by the one
Look here comes the judge, watch it here he come now
(Don't sentence me judge, I ain't did nothin' to nobody)
I can only guess what's happenin'
Years ago he woulda been the ship's captain
Gettin' me bruised on a cruise, what I got to lose
Lost all contact, got me layin' on my back
Ugh, rollin' in my own leftover
When I roll over, I roll over in somebody else
90 damn days on a slave ship
Count them fallin' off 1, 2, 3, 4 hundred at a time
Blood in the wood and it's mine
I'm chokin' on, spit, feelin' pain
Like my brain bein' chained
Still gotta give it what I got
But it's hot in the day, it's cold in the night
But I thrive to survive, I pray to god to stay alive
Attitude boils up inside
And that ain't it, you think I ever quit
Still I plan to get my hands around the neck of the man with the whip
3 months passed, they brand a label on my ass
To signify our owned, I'm on the microphone
Sayin' 1555, how I'm livin'
We been livin' here, livin' ain't the word, I been givin'
Haven't got, classify us in the have-nots
Fightin' haves cause it's all about money ""damn""
When it comes to Armageddon mean I'm getting mine
Here I am turn it over Sam
427 to the year, do you understand
That's why it's hard for the black to love the land

[Chuck D]
Once again, bass in your face, not an eight track
Gettin' it good to the wood
So the people give you some of that reactin' to the facts
That I kick and it stick and it stay around
Pointin' to the joint, put the Buddha down
Goin, goin, gettin' to the roots
Ain't givin' it up, so turn me loose
But then again I got a story that's harder than the hardcore

[Outro: Flavor Flav]
Can't truss it, can't truss it
You can't truss it, you can't truss it
You can't truss it, you can't truss it

Well, it's almost nightfall
And there's no forecast of rainfall
And I'm in the mood for a party
So I'm gonna go out to a club
And give the dancefloor body
So I jump in the car and go to the venue
Walk in the door and now I'm on the menu
Guys in the house, they're wacthing me
They're clocking me, there's no stopping me

[Refrain:]
(desire) I know you want me
(you're fine) thank you
But I'm not the type of girl that you think I am
I don't jump into the arms of every man
(but I'm paid) I don't need your money
(I love you) you must be mad
Easy lover is something that I ain't
Besides, I don't know you from a can of paint

Tell me why is it when I walk past the guys
I always hear, yo, baby?
I mean like what's the big idea?
I'm a queen, nuff respect
Treat me like a lady
And, no, my name ain't yo and I ain't got your baby
I'm looking for a guy who's sincere
One with class and savoir faire
I'm looking for someone who has to be
Perfect for the queen latifah me

(fly girl, fly girl)
(come here, cuz you're sexy and you're fine)
(and I want you to be mine)
(fly girl, fly girl)
(have no fear, your heart is in good hands)
(won't you let me be your man? )

All my friends are in relationships
Some of then good ones and some of them bad ones
Some of the bad ones took a turn for the better
And some of the good ones ended up sad ones
You see? loving, it ain't hard to get
I want a friend not just a lover
Someone who is dedicated only to me
Not to me and two or three others
One who will not lie to me or think
He can get my love by buying me
I know I'll find him some day
And when I find him
He sure won't say

[Refrain]

(fly girl, fly girl
(come here, cuz you're sexy and you're fine)
(and I want you to be mine)
(fly girl, fly girl, have no fear)
(have no fear, your heart is in good hands)
(won't you let me be your man? )

Lounging, sitting in the house
And I'm cooling, first day of the week
So there's nothing to do
And I'm in the mood for a real soft kiss
Momma never said there'll be days like this
So I called her and we talked for a while
Hang up the phone feeling better
With a smile

It's cool, cuz 91 is my year
And this time I know I'm gonna hear

(fly girl, fly girl, come here)
(come here, cuz you're sexy and you're fine)
(and I want you to be mine)
(fly girl, fly girl)
(have no fear, your heart is in good hands)
(won't you let me be your man? )

[Bridge: Dj Premier]
Step up

[Verse 1: Guru]
Once you step in the arena, cheater; you're gonna be a-
Mazed when you gaze at the armor on this leader
Fully clad and glad to fight a cause, I won't pause
Fear is a joke, slowpoke, I'm like claws
That'll rip cause your gift, is merely flesh
Superficial and I wish you, would give it a rest
But if you don't, I'll unsheath my Excalibur
Like a noble knight, so meet ya challenger
A true hero, while you're a through zero
Gettin beat to a pulp so that you can't run for help
I heard a gulp in your throat, cause you hope that I'll be merciful
But coo-cluck, I made you strut as I rehearse a few
Battle drills, and watch your bladder spill
Yellow fluid, check out how I mellowed into it
Face defeat to this beat, you can tell I'm into it
As I'm pullin out my lance, to kill you and advance to
The winner's throne; cause I own you once you step in the arena

[Bridge: Dj Premier]
Step up

[Verse 2: Guru]
In the arena... or rather colliseum
There's people gatherin by multitudes to see one
Perpretrator fall to the dust after the other
Quickly disposed of at the hand of a known brother
Born wit the art in his heart that is Spartacus
And one-to-one combat Jack, just a thought of this
Match-up, makes GangStarr wanna snatch up
One or two phrases from the new book with new pages
Of rhymes that are built like a chariot
Dope vocals carry it, to the battle set
If a beat was a princess, I would marry it
But now I must bow to the crowd as I stand proud
Victorius, glorious, understand now
Cause battles and wars and much fights I have been through
One MC got beheaded, and you can too
Forget it, cause you'd rather be just a spectator
An onlooker, afraid you may get slayed or
Struck by a blow, from a mic gladiator
I betcha that later you might be sad that you played yourself
Cause you stepped up, chest puffed out
And in just one lyric, you got snuffed out
Cause rhymin is serious, I'm strong, I'm like Hercules
You'll get hurt with these lines, close the curtains please
And suckers can jet cause I wreck once you step in the arena

[Bridge: Dj Premier]
Step inside my arena

[Verse 3: Guru]
In the arena or forum, weak MC's I will floor 'em
Causin mayhem, I'll slay them, and the blood'll be pourin
Furthermore I implore, that as a soldier of war
I go in only to win and be the holder of more
Trophies, titles, and triumphs cause I dump all the sly chumps
Never choosin to lose my spot, not once
For the mere idea of an opponent that I fear
Is foolish utterly, I mean but none'll be
Tryin to toy wit a destroyer of many
You shitted your pants cause you can't figure any
Foe that can step to this concept so
You better sit again citizen, weak MC's I get rid of them
Watch the way they get distraught when they get caught
In the worst positions, cause they didn't listen
And tried goin up against a hungry killer who's itchin
To maim and murder, those who claimed that they were the
Toughest ones, they get done once they step in the arena

[Bridge: Dj Premier]

I came to introduce a new type of juice
Stuff I invents to make you feel real loose
No you don't drink it, just let it sink it
Then start feelin' it (The Funky Cypress Hill Shit!)
People ask, ""Why do you sound so funny?""
They must be talkin' bout my funky nasal vocal money
I take control, no need to blow my nose
Just click on the chumpy and feel the funky flows
For you and your bros, him and his ho's
You don't like it? Here's my dick— bite it
There's nuttin you can do about the real one
It's a ill sum with the ill juice, I'm The Phuncky Feel One
Sen'll Psycobeta, blast ya if he hasta
Tell em Sen (I'm the Psycobeta master!)
Strikin' ya (hittin' ya) buckin' ya (fuckin' ya)
Like my buddha plant boy, I'm gonna keep pluckin' ya
Pickin' ya, then I'm gonna roll you up and light ya
Despite your fool ya sight to take my joint
To get to my point, I'm talkin' about a ill trip
The Funky Cypress Hill Shit

Let me tell you what happens when you squeeze, you're juiceless
You can't get loose, so now you're useless
Can't feel the funk so I guess I'll pump the wrist
How bout this ma kiss my blunt?
Right into ya, now you're feelin', the chemicals vibin'
Are you realizin', that it's gettin' better?
Surprisin' you, whether or not, your shit's together
From the high-pitched levels (comin' from my ""huevos"")
Cypress Hill imported it, boiled it in steam
But yo everything ain't what it seems
Cause the Cypress Hill material luxurious superior
Glory or memorial, historical physical
Ingredients, gettin' that immediate blend
Yo Sen take aim, and let the juice now extend
(Yeah I'm still comin' atcha, but you don't need to duck down
Cause this is somethin' different than a Psychobetabuckdown!)

[Verse 3: B-Real]
Intellect filthy en lingo
Dissed you, I control elements, suck on slow
(to get you all jazzed) from here to Tallahassee
This ain't Florida, so put away the O.J
Never in your life will you wet this
This crazy business, now you're thinkin' ay que pinga
Tremenda, re cinda it's good like some cheeba
The formula will run ya I'll start takin' up a list
So you can get blitzed and you feel your head's twisted
Now insisted, you fill it to the brim
Yo I ain't him, I could never be them
This ain't poison, so let's go out on a limb
For the boys and girls who haven't had it yet
If you get too much, and roll it too straight, oh
It's a fatal blow, somethin' like a K.O
Yeah it'll sting ya fria cojones
See ya, I'm on it, somethin' for the blunted
Just what you wanted, so you can feel the high
Smokin' the buddha thai
Lungs expandin' and now you're feelin' it
Yeah, the funky cypress hill shit!

[Master Ace]
I'm about to run, run a race with the rhythm
If you know the bass steps, dance, do it wit 'em
Gotta clock Gs, cause the G's worth a thousand
When I kick these types of rhymes I'll be housing
All I wanna be, gonna be big shotties
Brothers ain't wit it then I do it for the hotties
But I know they wit it cause they know I ain't a phony
And it feels good like Tony! Toni! Toné!
And I like to kick a rhyme, rhyme for the people
Wanna reach the top, climb, climb to the steeple
Top to high? Well you best get a ladder
Say you're from the slum, well chum it don't matter
Forget where you're from, it's all about where you're going
My name is Masta Ace and I don't tip toeing
Never saw fall, lose my grip, or take a slip
Make a house call, hit a dip and then I skip
But not to my Lou, I never play hopscotch
Music man baby and the rhymes are top notch
Gotta try to uplift, lift the ghetto dweller
I try my best to never riff, riff wit a fellow
My brother sometimes tries to play it like tennis
Dennis, time to pull teeth like a dentist
Oh brother, brother, please don't play it
The rhyme is prime everytime that I say it
Action's in effect, nothing change but the weather
Juice Crew? Nah, but we still rock together
Craig G
(Yo, I believe that's me)
Hey yo, Craig G
(Yo, I believe that's me)
Hey yo, Craig G
(Yo man I believe that's me)
Kick it 1,2,3

[Craig G]
Yo, once again a brother's back to attract many age groups
Sporting green and beige boots, popping like the hula hoop
You step to me and you'll be stepping to a death wish
You probably thought I'm soft, of course you never met this
I'm not a crazy man, gun-totin' hooligan
But pass a mic to me and rappers I'll be doing in
So, yo, hit, slide to the left a bit
Cause I'm about to blow up in the '90s and I bet you get
Jelly and think of trying to do me
I work for my spot so don't try to remove me
Cause I can swing a rap like a batter hits a fast ball
Put on my track shoes and run right pass all
Corny MCs and wannabes
Get played like a permanent crease in your Lees
So next time the wizard gives you soft as a heart
Don't step to me because I rip the shit apart
Now this ain't Mr. Rogers and I never play pretend
So think about it chump if you step to me again
Yo Big Daddy
(Yo I believe that's me)
Hey yo Big Daddy
(Yo I believe that's me)
Big Daddy
(Well I guess that's me)
1,2,3

[Big Daddy Kane]
Uhn, damn, it's true, I'm living mathematics
Asiatic, coming up on the microphone just like an addict
Make the fit, 100% legit
As soon as I hit, hoo shit
Cause I'm gonna make the audience applaud me
And support me and award me when they saw me
In action wit my softy gin
Sharper than any other instrument
That archeologists can find, never known to mankind
Cause I'm a weird species
And all you Filthy McNasty MCs couldn't even see me
You're too fragile to touch this mass style
Girls be running up saying, oh, you're too bad child
So save your breath and exit stage left
But treat before you meet defeat and greet death
You any champion that even tries to touch this
Won't even get to keep his title long as Douglas
See, I'm the wrong one to fuck wit
Oh you still standing there
(Yo, yo, look out duck kid)
I'm deathing and bashing crash and smack MC's
And enemies wit these
Cause I make sure everything comes out smooth

[Lil' Daddy Shane]
But you know your little brother must deserve this groove
Drop something quick release a rhyme wit quickness
To let MCs know about my existence
Any MC to last a minute is pure lucky
Cause I'm the baddest kid that you seen since Chucky
(Well Kool G Rap)
(Yo I believe that's me)
So G Rap
Yo I believe that's me
(So Kool G Rap)
(Yo, I believe that's me)
1,2,3

[Kool G Rap]
Yo, straight out the muthafucking gutter
I open my shutter, the butt ass brothers
And rip 'em up like a box cutter
You press up, I pull the trigger
I figured nobody could dig a Milli Vanilli-ass nigga
Prepare for shoot bear, I'm knocking boots daily
Fruits, I rip 'em out of their roots like Alex Haley
Here I come straight to the mouth
I'm kicking it slick, lyrics are harder than a dick inside a ho house
Your neighborhood hero's a zero
I'm sending muthafuckers on a Midnight Run like DeNiro
So here goes a rapper to the baffled
Feel a steel scalpel pressed up on your Adam's apple
Reach for the pistol and you're crazy
Try to blast and I'll be spinnin' that ass like Patrick Swayze
Said he was frightened when I rock, they came in a flock
What is this shit, New Kids on the Cock?
So fake rappers try to diss, you're a little too proud
But niggas on white clouds are on my shit list
Do your ass in, like Kennedy's assassin
Murder the whole mass and, time for tresspassin'
I flow on notes like a sailor, hoes are like clothes
I got that ass sewn up just like a tailor
Kool G Rap, one in a million
You're rolling the dice and get sliced the fuck up like a Sicilian
A nigga can't do shit for me
G Rap and Marly Marl, I'm signing out on the symphony

Make ya smile from a simple kiss
Close your eyes and I'll grant your first wish
Open your arms and wrap me tight like a teddy bear
Then take your fingers and run it thru my hair

Champagne bottle in the corner half done
Room's still bright from the morning sun

[Introducing..]
I'm in the gangsta stroll, so you better run hide
Fools on slide, so keep your kids inside
Explicit words in this rhyme I wrote
Ain't no jack move fool so please don't
Demonstrate your style is weak you can't compete
And just like a girl, get freaked
It's the big 91 and Eiht's coming
Compton criminal fool so start running
And please stop biting my stuff
As the rhyme gets rough you done had enough
Of the Eiht, the gangsta mack, the pimp hustla
And pistol whip a weak busta
Suckers run up and get slapped
Damn, I thought you was smarter then that
Then to dis the brother who is Compton stepping
Microphone is kept as the murder weapon
I'm straight Checkn 'Em

(scratching: Check this out... X4)

No shorts are taken, I give it to you long and slow
Hard fools, drop your gaurd
No your not prepared, your scared, no time to sleep
Can't bargain with your rap, cause its cheap
And if I have to show, like Rambro
And snap a neck with some Compton effect
And get buck wild sucker
And serve em all like cluckers
You just can't hang with your weak style
You slip right off a the pile
To me your just another pretender
So wave the white flag, boy surrender
And if you a female species
Tryin to gank then girl you'll get these. Famous vapours, walk in
Papers, see you later
You little crooked alligator
You gets no juice
And if you scheme on my team then I'll cut you loose
You can't handle the format
Punk, I'll use you as a doormat
I'm straight checkn em

(scratching)

I puts my foot down, so all the suckers get clowned
As the MC Eiht steps from the underground
A villain from the city under seige
Where the brothers jack, girlies skeeze
I'm breaking them off proper
And taking no B.S. from a copper
Fools on my tip keep sweating me
And trying to gank my Compton melody
You can't withstand the powerful blow
From a brother with a def wish [huh?]
Others I smother and change their description
Wait a minute did I mention
That I flow punk fools with one swing
Bow down to the Compton king-
Pin, the record spins and that spells the end
For you my friend
I'm straight Checkn em

(scratching)

Lets get our scraps on boy
And the Eiht'll destroy
And play you just like a toy
Fools try and they can't hang cause they raps just simp
I thought so wimp
I'm blasting, peeling caps, making snaps
For the violence in my raps
Gotta pack tools cause fools don't wanna back on my tip
Geah, but thats cool
I give em a count backwards 10 to 1
Then they tale is done
I give up no slack
Because a sucker tried to punk my style and call it wack
Now I'm back to attack
And give em hype, just like they feinding for crack
So come on, come on, cause Eiht and Mike'll keep deckn' em
Geah fool, straight checkn em

286,2649,D-Nice,25 Ta Life,25,1991-11-09,"

It was a hot summer day, I was dyin from the heat
Walkin up 118th street
Although I'm hot like stew
In the back of my mind it was a bottle of brew
Now a ice cold bottle would just quench my thirst
Or get some boom from the dread, which ever one comes first
Now is it brew? (yeah) or is it boom? (yeah)
So I lit up the boom and now may I presume? (yeah)
Now about 3 o'clock I had to meet my crew
I looked at my watch and then I noticed it was half past 2
I saw these two honeys walkin down the avenue
And one of them said: all I think about is havin you
Now in my mind I realized I coulda took her, coulda took her
But Nice is not the one to treat the ladies like a hooker
Don't mean to diss, but it's not on my list
So I gave her a kiss and said: ehm, good-bye, miss
From the streets I heard a horn beep
There was a crew 4 deep in a dark blue jeep
I heard em speak, he said: my ride is fat
So why you're sweatin D-Nice, baby, he ain't all that
Now first things first, why all the rude behaviour
You shoulda been taught how to respect this flavor
He jumped out the jeep like yo, what up chief
But I don't eat pork, so I guess he wanted beef
I realized I was on my own
I didn't proceed to make a move until a blow was thrown
He swung but missed, I caught him with a fist
Although I wish it didn't have to come to this
I started breakin him down with the speed, had him astounded
The right caught his jaw and it sounded
Like boom boom bap boom bam
He had no idea that D was nice with his hands
He stepped back, so I thought he was through
But right about now up steps his crew
We all threw down and went round for round
I'm givin it all I had to give until I fell face down

They proceeded to stomp but in all of the madness
Somehow someway I was damn sure glad this
Person slid me a pistol from behind
Not the weasel, pop-pop-pop goes the 9
So if you're wonderin why you ain't heard word of them
I (murder them murder them)
But since I pulled the trigger I guess I have to pay the price
Pushin 25 to life

Yoooooo!
Chubb Rock comin back hard for nineteen nine-TY!
Word up, word up
Kick this out to my man Rob Swinga, Hot Dog Dinky
Manager (?) Ev Lover y'knahmsayin? Dr. No, here we go..

[Verse One]
It's the Hitman, yes the Hitman, yo ya know it
The thirst quencher, the man on the sequencer
He was scared to kick a sixteen bar, he's not a rap star
Not saying that I am, but I'm the jam
I'm going to kick a little not a Dr. Suess riddle
No cats in hats, fox in some socks
But to the DJ jocks check your clocks
Half past what? Time to bust nut
Not a pistachio; he uses a Casio keyboard
And a Tascam board
To kick in the P-50, get nifty
Born with the gift, time to get riffed
Not with the manufacturing of a spliff
He never rolled one; never sold none
The beats give me the high that brought fame to us
And, how we gonna kick it, How?
(Just the two of us!)

[Verse Two]
Chubb has been dope since he came out the shaft of his pops' wood
Yes I'm (*good!*)
Yo he shouted and he plopped into the uterus
And they knew this about me; was gonna be a dope MC
When I get on the mic my windpipe strikes and ignites
A lyric when you hear it you fear it and like
Chubb is not a man to get souped like Campbell
I'm the man with the plan and my jam sells
Like a whore, in the store, hardcore and more
On the tour makin money you never saw
I don't like dreaming, never ever beam and
Never involved with girls like like scheming
Or skiing or toboggan sledding, cause I'm shredding
Any thoughts of a wedding, so Helen, Keller
Listen to the rules and
Me and Hitman Howie Tee is all about coolin
She went buckwild, screamed, yelled, hollered
I told her I loved her and then she did a solid
Did it real good like a nice girl should
Back polish waxed up the hood
Yo Hitman Howie Tee you should have seen her on me
She got all Vanessa Del Rio on me
But after she slept cause I had nothin left
On the Martin Butler tip, yes half step
But yo cousin Howie Tee and me
Our love is all about making a dope LP
That will crush and sell and bum rush
Don't hush, how we gonna do it How?

Behind the wheel, other foot's on the pedal
Bang, bang, earned another neighborhood medal
Hit the pedal, it sounded like this
Another one down on his death list
Stayed pissed tight fist, when one even glanced
Tech-9 slid in front of his pants
At a dance one disses his partner Bo
Kid ain't know Bo was with Lil Trig and Joe
Joe asked Bo: 'Yo, you know that kid?'
'Step to that kid for what he done did!'
So Bo stepped, talked to me son?
Bang, bang, bang, got done, not one
Bodies dropped, yes, yes, he did
Sprayed the whole spot, guess who? Lil Trig...

Was on a mission going bazerk
Sucked his teeth when moms mentioned work
'Jerk, jerk, good for nothing bum!'
Pops said to Lil Trig, his son, while sipping rum
Was numb, no sorrow when playing crap
Stayed strapped when he'd loose, pulled out and attacked
Took the bank, that's how he live, he didn't give a
Shot any and plenty, yes, Lil Trigger...

Lil Trig, many feared and disliked
So cold he robbed a lady who had no sight
Blind, didn't matter, he'd shoot a cop
Wouldn't stop till he seen the cop drop
He shot a kid dead in the dome
Took his ride, Rolex and cellular phone
Guess what he done next?
Crashed his girl cause she had sex...
With this kid on the other side of the town
Trig was steaming hot, said gonna kill that clown
Called three of his soldiers, they rolled out
Looking for that kid's whereabouts...

Creeped slowly, lights off, car full
I'm not even gonna mention first who pulled...
At five kids kicking it on the steps
Bang, bang, bang, sound of a Tech
Ducked, bullet flew through a screen
Hit a girl in the eye, only thirteen
From a donut spot came to where they was firing
High beams, colorful lights and sirens
Quick U-turn, Trig kept spraying but...
Cop shot the driver, threw the door in the gut
Car out of control, hit a pole
Two dead, other knocked out cold
Trig in a daze, cop said: 'Hands up! I repeat!'
He did the opposite, bang, dead in his seat
One survivor serving life, can you figure?
Was it the gov't, his pops, the streets or Lil Trigger?

293,2724,3rd Bass,Portrait Of The Artist As A Hood,25,1991-11-30,"

Today I'm prepared to bring specific charges
Against certain members working in an industry
That reaches into every household in the country

[Verse One: Pete Nice]
Hoods is up so skills is up
It's a stick-up, so why'd you interrupt?
So such bust material cerebral
I'm eatin' cereal with spoons, sippin' Cepacol
Daddy-O slipped me some cause my breath stank
White gold, but no accounts in Swiss banks
Think tanks once rolled on the city streets
I used to meet your moms between the sheets
Universe is versus hoods prospectus
True flam, flammin' words on wax discus
So they dismiss this as vulgarity
And once laughed and pointed at the university
Some perk without skills and push a pen
I send surreal scenes where you never been
Looked out, gave you three strikes, you struck out
Pop shit with the 3rd, knock your fronts out
Blew your blunts out you wings stuck up your ass
Gassed you up then slap you with my staff
I seen your skins like to go to the motels
But your ass won't know to the hotels
Cause a lip is zipped, I paint pictures
A portrait, a self far from tipsters
My discussion of impression ain't ignorance
So don't label the hoods on appearances
You never thought that a gangster could talk sense
But this artifice flipped, your beans is spent
Took your papes out your pocket and just stood out
The focus, the portrait of the artist as a hoods-up

[Verse Two: MC Serch]
Portrait painted back in the days
Young strays, posted at the L.Q. on Fridays
Waitin' for Dice to give the go ahead
Hawkin' 50 cent, puttin' heads to bed
For a herringbone hear the tone of the Audio Two
Milk was chillin' as I chilled in the back room
Listening to Snaps pushed by Scoob and Scrap
Union Square, to tear up the KRS tracks
Torn up by the Kent, the Clark Dark
As the brothers try to spark
We knocked boots, and the boots got knocked
Three A.M. and it was off to The Rooftop
Hip-Hop Starski, the Masters of Ceremony
Ka-ka-cracked out, was hookin' property
Five A.M. it was the S&S
A hundred and forty-fifth street, down on Lennox
Starchild made all the hoes squeal
For a dollar crackheads Armor-Alled your wheels
Whippin' home in the sunshine, fun time
But now you can't find
Clubs like this that kept the music in the street
And pop rap couldn't get a dime to eat
Yo, they're makin' mills, but what about the hood?
A parking lot, where the Latin Quarter stood!
A landmark marked in the cranium
But now I bring it back in front of packed stadiums
Picture painted with the goals and the good
The portrait of an artist as a hood

[S] Yo Pete man, yo where the hoods at Pete?
[P] Yo the hoods is in Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx
Money-makin Strong Island
[S] Yo can't forget Newark New Jersey
Philly, D.C
[P] From Detroit to Mobile Alabama
Memphis Tennesse Cleveland
[S] Yo, money-makin Miami, Chicago
East St. Louis got crazy hoods
[P] Oakland Compton Watts wearin the hoods
[S] Yo true indeed, Louisville
Boostin Houston got CRAZY hoods
[P] New Orleans, Seattle
[S] North Carolina cannot forget about Atlanta
Shockmaster Glen Boyd got crazy hoods
Listenin to his program
[P] And the hoods are holdin their joint
And they're out

294,2743,ED O.G & DA Bulldogs,Be A Father To Your Child,19,1991-12-07,"

[Verse 1]
Ayo, be a father, if not, why bother, son
A boy can make 'em, but a man can raise one
If you did it, admit it then stick with it
Don't say it ain't yours, 'cause all women are not whores
Ninety percent represent a woman that is faithful
Ladies, can I hear it? (Thank you)
When a girl gets pregnant, her man is gonna run around
Dissin' her for nine months, when it's born, he wants to come around
Talking that I'm sorry for what I did
And all of a sudden he wants to see his kid
She had to bear it by herself and take care of it by herself
And givin' her some money for milk won't really help
Half of the fathers with sons and daughters don't even wanna take 'em
But it's so easy for them to make 'em
It's true, if it weren't for you then the child wouldn't exist
After a skeeze, there's responsibilities so don't resist

[Chorus 4X]
Be a father to your child

[Verse 2]
You see, I hate when a brother makes a child and then denies it
Thinking that money is the answer so he buys it
A whole bunch of gifts and a lot of presents
It's not the presents, it's your presence and essence
Of being there and showing the baby that you care
Stop sittin' like a chair and having your baby wondering where you are
Or who you are--fool, you are his daddy
Don't act like you ain't 'cause that really makes me mad, G
To see a mother and a baby suffer
I've had enough of brothers who don't love the
Fact that a baby brings joy into your life
You could still be called daddy if the mother's not your wife
Don't be scared, be prepared 'cause love is gonna getcha
It'll always be your child even if she ain't wit'cha
So don't front on your child when it's your own
'Cause if you front now, then you'll regret it when it's grown

[Chorus]
Be a father to your child

[Verse 3]
Put yourself in his position and see what you've done
But just keep in mind that you're somebody's son
How would you like it if your father was a stranger
And then tried to come into your life and tried to change the
Way your mother raised ya; now, wouldn't that amaze ya?
To be or not to be, that is the question
When you're wrong, you're wrong, it's time to make a correction
Harassin' the mother for being with another man
But if the brother man can do it better than you can
Let him. Don't sweat him, duke
Let him do the job that you couldn't do
You're claimin' you was there, but not when she needed you
And now you wanna come around for a day or two?
It's never too late to correct your mistakes
So get yourself together for your child's sake
And be a father...to your child

[Verse 1]
Swing, you get up and dance and do your own thing
Cause I got the groove to make your eardrums ring
And I bring this, to all the party people that demand most
Funky as Parliament, smooth as Luther Vandross
I wouldn't present myself to you as somethin that sound nervous
You want it to be live, so here it is at your service
The B the I the G the D-A-double-D-Y
And when it comes to rippin the mic, oh my oh my oh my
I guarantee you by time I'm through
You gotta give me more props than a Motown Revue
And if you thinkin this groove would ever come to an end
Hah, not from a hair off my chinny chin chin

[Chorus] [repeat 2x]
For you to groove with it
You've got to move with it
Here's what you do with it
Now it's on you, kick it

[Verse 2]
Don't ya don't ya don't ya don't ya want
To feel jubilation, a musical vibration
Instead of the feel of paranoia
Thinkin to ride or break out and someone'll floor ya
Good grief, another beef at a concert
The rappers are gettin a rep behind the people that's gettin hurt
The way the fights at the shows are happenin
You might as well let Mike Tyson start rappin
You see we have to realize the main factor
Is to have peace and let the violence cease
So don't throw your fists up, unless you're gonna pump em
In the air, and scream oh yeah, youknowhatI'msayin?

[Chorus] [repeat 2x]

[Verse 3]
Check the lyrics that's flowin right over the tongue like a machete
My silk drawers are sweaty so you know the Kane is ready
To go to work and my job for the evening
Is to pick up the microphone and rap to relieve them
The party society, groovin in a high anxiety
There's dancers by the variety, so go 'head and try it G
As I do body work like Midas
And I can remove the slightest, case of arthritis
Or even rhumabotosis as I heal you with the rhythm
Cause the remedy for the party people standin around is ummm
Dancin and havin a ball
So live life like Michael Jackson, Off the Wall
And wiggle your bodyparts, and start to party hard
Lettin the rhythm run through like a trolley car
Here's a sound you can get into
Uhh, and now it's on you

[Chorus] [repeat 2x]

Right right
Now just hold on for a second baby
I gotta put my shades on for this
Yeah, we gonna keep this here broken down for a while
And just toss it up like a French salad, yaknahmsayin?
Umm, aiyyo Bob I need you to pump that bass to the FULLEST
Hold on Mike, we gonna get to you in a second
Bret Lover I need you over here on the side of me for a minute
Ahh, I want you to get a little piece of this here, okay baby?

Let's take a trip, on the other side of the land
With things ain't planned for the average man
You can be a young brother who's rolling
And now things so good that you're holding
Big bank, top rank
Mr. Too Cold, who got all the hoes
Pushin hard to keep from being bound
Cause there's always somebody tryin to bring you down
Try to run a scheme on what you got
'Cause what you got, them niggas jot
Women love it and brothers hate it
They just can't stand to see you make it
A girl can be your main downfall
She don't take half, the hoe takes all
Now check to see how your cards are dealt
And stay true to yourself

[Verse 2: KK]
Keep cool, little girl
You got what you deserve
Don't copycat when a rich hoes splurge
Cause yo, you might break yourself
Trying to keep up with somebody else
Waiting for the mailman to bring you a check
(Money all gone) Now you're a wreck
Taking your friends out for a big feast
You wanna treat and you don't even eat
Looking all stupid with a messed up grin
Trying to be nice so you can fit in?
Huh! Couldn't get your hair done
Now you're unhappy cause your head all nappy
And it's a shame, you ain't got no money
Girl, that shit ain't funny
No friends to cope, you got with the dope
Wasn't true, now it ain't no hope
Shoulda been true to yourself

[Verse 3: Tha D]
Momma always told me, there'd be days like this
On top of all of this bullshit
Never, ever let a young girl make you
Let alone, a hoe break you
Being strong in the mind will make you a true
And make you jack no one and make them jack you
Yo, K, come express how you feel
Show 'em how to be, real

[KK]
True, open your eyes and look
The best friend might be the crook
You solved the case but you still winded up
Saying nothing - yet, that's your best friend
'Till the end, now he in trouble
Where's the friend? He left with a hoe
And you're stuck, outta luck
Nobody else helps, you shoulda been true to yourself

[Scratching: DJ Quik]
Ayo, Quik why don't you show 'em you're true to these tables

[Outro: KK]
Yeah, this shit goes out to all them people
Who ain't true to theyself
Runnin up behind somebody else, following in they shadow
Get on your own tip, fools
(And stay out the next man nuts)
Haha, we out

"
298,2796,Scarface,Mr. Scarface,22,1991-12-21,"

Mr. Mr. Scarface from walking down the block
Out jumps some fiends and steals all his rocks
Pulls out a gun and shoots down all the fiends
And Mr. Mr. Scarface went up the block again

(All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have, all I have, all I have in this world)

Ahh yeah, hah
Mr. Scarface is back in the motherfuckin house once again!
Yea, droppin some of that new
Mr. Scarface Two, on your motherfuckin ass
So suck a nigga dick, or make a nigga rich
Or something, bitch

[Verse 1: Scarface]
I don't give a FUCK about the chatter in the background
Niggas get beat when they step this is Ak's town
If you don't know, I recommend you check
And ask them motherfuckers, how many heads I put to rest
I play a game but the game ain't roulette
Slangin 'caine is the thang and I bet
That there's a lot of wannabe Scarfaces
I've heard the name in ninety-nine different places
I'm here to squash it all original will speak
Scarface on your ass from the streets
I left my cut, in fear of a prison term
They wanna put me in a chair and let me burn
But go to prison on a murder rap, fuck that
I refuse to be a visitor in state's camp
So I broke and left behind all I worked for
Either that or be sentenced for a drug war
And many want to know why I've slowed up
It's either that or get fucked
Cause laws get happy on the trigger
Say fuck it put a cap in a nigga
But this ass ain't made for no caps homey
This ass says 'Exit Only'
So I get in the wind but hey
A nigga still sold a quarter everyday
I sat around for six months black
Waitin for the day to make a comeback
And now I'm ready for combat
Mr. Scarface is back

[Hook x2]
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world
All I have, all I have, all I have in this world)
Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
On the for-reala my nigga just call me Scarface

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Aiyyo Bido, drop that shit
Yeah, heh heh
Back in the South Park, six o'clock on the dot
Checkin on my old rock spot
I seen the same old set
Heh, the small timers see me so they jet
Buildin one-twenty-eight
I got myself a bag and I can't wait
To cut em up small to make a profit
Niggas on the cut short stop it
Fiends'll see em small then they go
Where, to see the motherfuckin pro
One nigga got pissed
And started reachin for his shit
Three-fifty-seven on your ass fool
Like I said before, you don't get a second chance dude
Unloaded on his ass he was hurt
Six shots put his dick in the dirt
Laid him out like a motherfuckin rug
Gettin pumped full of thirty-eight slugs
Some other niggas stepped out y'all
Aww shit, I had to make a phone call

[Interlude: Skit]
Hello?
Hay Jay
Whassup?
I'm in a little trouble man
Where you at?
I'm out here in South Park Village
Stay right there, I'll be right on
C'mon let's take these motherfucers to war man

Jay called up some niggas from the 5th Ward
And came back with a motherfuckin hit squad
Motherfuckin uzi machine
Big Chief packed an M-16
Will an AK with a banana clip
And little Bill had a god damn pistol grip
I hit a little laugh and got me a buzz
And that's about the time they got drugged
One more war took place
You can call me the shit starter, or call me Mr. Scarface

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Scarface]
Damn, check this shit out
Later on, all alone, you know what happened next
Another bitch came by to give me sex
It was kind of strange I was thrown off
The last bitch got her head blown off
But fuck I ain'tsta pass up no putty
She started strippin at the door, oh goody
I got in that ass with the quickness
Fuckin her down with the diznick
I didn't have to pretend I loved her
All she wanted me to do was just fuck her
So I gave it up to the lady
And all she said was 'Fuck me baby, fuck me baby'
I started stroking in an outrage
The whole while I was starin at my twelve gauge
The bitch was makin noise I said I'm killin her
And all the while my dick was hard and he was still in her
I made a nut as she fell to the floor
I heard a knock on the front door
I grabbed the twelve gauge from the bed head
Who is it? (Fred) Who?
Who the fuck is Fred, I stood by the door
By that time someone jumped in the window
Now what the fuck was I do? *bam bam bam*
The bitch packed a twenty-two
Hit him in his head, there she laid him
The nigga standin by the door I sprayed him *automatic fires*
And headed for the back
I seen that same old brown cadillac
It kinda fucked me up at first
Cause the nigga that drove that caddy rode away in a hearse
I opened up fire on the ride G
Who I was shootin for was standin right behind me
I had a double barrel pointed at my ass
Could this be the end of Mr. Brad?
I don't know what happened to the slut
Well that's about the time the closet door it opened up
*kicked open* On your ass trick!
I'll be damned if I go out like the last bitch!
Heh, five-oh's on my ass man
They know me by the face, but they don't know my last name
Now I'm back on the case
Yeah, just call me Mr. Scarface

Here they come yo, here they come
Here they come yo, here they come
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?
This or that?

[Verse 1]
Who's the black sheep, what's the black sheep?
Know not who I am, or when I'm coming, so you sleep
Wasn't in my realm, or wasn't in your sphere
Knew not who I was, but listen here
Dres, D-R-E-S, yes I guess I can start
If it's all right with you, I'll rip this here joint apart
Back, middle, to the front, don't front
Wanna a good time, gonna give you what you want
Can I hear a hey? (hey)
Can I get a yo? (yo)
You got a 'hat? (huh)
It's for the hoes (oh)
The styling is creative, black sheep of the native
Can't be violated, or even decepticated
I got brothers in the Jungle, cousins on the quest
Dead departed uncles, in pea porridge, may they rest
Guess, which way, what, when, how
Mista Lawnge, Dres, Black Sheep slam... Now
Know you've heard the others, phonies to the lovers
Then of course, the choice is yours

[Hook]
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is kinda phat

[Verse 2]
Where's the black sheep, here's the black sheep
Even if we wanted to, the flock could not be weak
Watch me swing like this, why should I swing it like that
Because in fact, on me it might not attract
Therefore I ignore, do as I feel inside
I live with me, I've got my back tonight
Ya know what I'm saying
Yo Black, I'm not playing
Need to go with this, or go with this with no delay and
See, in actuality, wonder can it be
I made it look easy, because it is to me
Any time capacity was filled, tried to rock it
Any time a honey gave us play, tried to knock it
Never was a fool, so we finished school
Never see us sweat, and you'll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
Don't punch girls, and we don't punch a clock
Gotta go, gotta go, see you later by the cat
And you can't beat that with a bat

[Hook]
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is kinda phat

[Break]
Engine, engine, number nine
On the New York transit line
If my train goes off the track
Pick it up! Pick it up! Pick it up!

[Verse 3]
Back on the scene, crispy n' clean
You can try, but then why, cause you can't intervene
We be the outcast, down for the settle
Won't play the rock, won't play the pebble
Open the door, you best believe, we're sliding through it ... sssswiftly
Niftily, we can make it hip to be what we are
Cause what we be, be the epitome, doo, dah, dipitty
So now I dwell just to say you're plainer
Hold your cup, cause I got the container
Pass a plate or, cross the fader
Black sheep get play like the Sony Innovator
Never the traitor, party inflater
And you can get a scoop ... later

[Hook]
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is kinda phat
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at

[Intro]
God damn!
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
And when dealin' wit' Da Lench Mob you gots to know steady mobbin' is not just the name of this jam, but a way of life
Bound together by motherfuckers as known to break em' off something
Give it to me

[Sample] (x4)
""There goes the neighborhood""
""There goes the neighborhood""
""There goes the neighborhood""
""There goes the neighborhood""

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Four or five niggas in a mothership
Better known as a deuce and we all wanna smother shit
Bent, front and back glass got tint
Tryin' to get our hands on some dollars and cents
And fools can't hold us
Every chance we get, we hittin' up the rollers
Comin' up short of the green guys
And I might start slangin' bean pies
Or the bootleg t-shirt of the month
With ""U Can't Touch This"" on the front
I'm 'bout to get rich
Cause life ain't nuttin but money and fuck a bitch
They drop like dominoes
And if you didn't know, Ice Cube got drama hoes
So after the screwin'
I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings
I'm out the door
All you might get is a rubber on the floor
Cause I'm ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti
Bitch, cause I'm steady mobbin'

[Hook]
(""Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?"") (Steady mobbin')
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
(Steady mobbin')

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Bustin' caps in the mix
Rather be judged by twelve than carried by six
Cause I'm gettin' major
Fuck Pactel, move to Sky Pager
Told all my friends:
Don't drink 8 Ball, cause St. Ide's is givin ends
Fools get drunk and wanna compete
Slapboxin in the street
Niggas get mad, tempers are flarin'
Cause they got a few bitches starin'
Just for the nappy heads
But scandalous bitches, make for happy Feds
I make it my duty to cuss 'em
Out, cause I just don't trust em
And if you tell on me I'm bombin' on Betty
Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin'

[Hook]
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
(Steady mobbin')
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Since one-time so hot
Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the Glock
'Cause I'm rollin' on rims
Eating soul food, neckbones from M&M's
Grubbin' like a motherfucker
Greasy-ass lips, now I gots to take a shit
Saw Sir Jinx bailin'
When I hit a left on Ruthelen, ""Whattup loc?""
Don't you know that niggas get smoked
They take they life for a joke, get in nigga
I'll take you to the pad soon
Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my low rider
Comin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob ain't nuttin but tramps
But hoes lickin' nuts like stamps
One fool bumpin' music for the yamps
But Ice Cube had more amps, get in bitch
Cause I had the jam on
And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon
Give me the nappy and make me happy
The ho said 'Pappy could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash?'
I said yeah, but I don't play sex
Without puttin' on the latex
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night, no longer steady mobbin'

[Hook]
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
(Steady mobbin')
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
(Steady mobbin')
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?

1-2, 1-2
Yeah
My name is MC Breed
I'm down with DJ Flash Technology, right?
And what we're doin here together as a team, the true-doers
Is what we call
Kickin it
Ah-ha, I said
We kickin it

[Verse 1: MC Breed]
Da-bigga-da-bigga-da-bigga-da-bigga-da-bigga
Da-bigga-da-bigga-da-Back in '86 when I started this
I said, the people told me: ""Breed, you're not an artist""
But now it's 1990, I'm servin em well
With the rhymes, rhythms, style and clientele
Concert after concert, one after the other
A man with the plan, plus a hustler undercover
A president, a guy of his own
Said, I knew I was proper, and I knew I was strong
But all it takes is concentration, rhyme calculation
Enough crew members to carry a nation
To be exact, yo Jack, I rehearsed
The cat wants your tongue, but I be catchin it first
And I'm kickin it

(Ah yeah)

[ VERSE 2: MC Breed ]
Said, it's real necessary, not lack of control
To be at the tip-top with nothin but bankroll
To develop an actual skill, son
You gotta be born a natural real one
Not high up on a pedestal, just a born idol
To me it's just a typical man-made title
To remain an architect and stand, in fact
You're startin to sweat, to eject is your best bet
Certified legal, not against the law
I'm not irrelevant, but terribly raw
I got on-the-job knowledge and puttin it on paper
No bun for those who b.s. the baker
That's right, the mack Eric Breed is all that
It's pretty simple, not to mention a fact
Causin major upsets for you so-called vets
Who was there in the beginning, now you're sittin in check
I'm kickin it

(Ah yeah)
Yeah, I'm kickin it

Now this beat is so dope
Yo Flash, get busy one time
Uknowmsayin?

[ VERSE 3: MC Breed ]
Nigga-da-nigga-da-nigga-da-ni...
Not once do I think I need to change my mind
Technology's here with me to co-sign
Yeah, for the occasion, Breed's invasion of death force
Sit back, relax, Techno cuts of course
Yo, the B-r-double e-d, and it's me
]From the city of F-l-i-n-t with Technology
Servin on the wheels of steel and we're real
And if you squeel you're killed, pimp, that's the deal
Big Breed, I'm servin at the top of my mind
But his wax is just like 'jax, so then grind
It's like MC Kickin-It, one time like this and that
Step back, Jack, goin black for black
Yeah, not wearin a Kangol, but maybe a cable
Thick shades, now you know, no lookin like Kool Moe
Yo, the rhyme that I'll be kickin will collect
D-d-d-all respect, so why should I fess?
And I'm kickin it

Da-bigga-da yeah
Huh, and I'm kickin it

And I am MC Smooth B
Together we are Nice & Smooth with Pure Blend harmony
And just in case you've wondered where we roamed
We'll say that we're sorry for keeping you waiting so long

[ VERSE 1: Greg Nice ]
Now countries at war, little kids cry rape
Some are lyin, dyin, cryin, pullin on my cape
Massive meltdown, bring the red tape
Back up victims who caught the vapes
New lp, time to make papes
Get the album, the single, cd and tapes
Stylin, profilin, smilin, buck wildin
As the dough keeps on pilin
Somebody's knockin at my do'
(Who is it?) Somebody's ringin my bell
(Should I let em in?) Oh, what the hell
Flippin my wig like I never did before
Got my rhymes than the mighty Thor
Peace, arrivederci, I'm out the door

Yeah, yeah
Make it rain, mutha

[ VERSE 2: Smooth B ]
I'm Smooth B, I'm at the top of the pile
Rap and sing, cause I'm versatile
Give me an inch, damn right, I'll take a mile
Cause I keep funky fresh routines on file
There's a lot of MC's out there that show and don't prove
Runnin round town, talkin bout they're smooth
They're smooth operators, Smooth imitators
But only one Smooth B, the smooth originator
Smooth connaisseur, there's no one truer
Select a rhyme, and you'll find that few are
Able to match my professional blend
With Greg Nice by my side I continue to ascend
Movin on up through the lyrical light
I'm like the Alpha Omega, my rhymes will excite
Bust what I'm sayin, cause I'll always exist
And the girl that I select will be an emperess

[ VERSE 3: Greg Nice ]
Now I scooped this high heel, sweet as a shroodle
Found out she liked to eat noodles
For her birthday I bought her a french poodle
Now - get down, get down
It's a Friday night, let's paint the town
Tim Snake on the funky drum sound
Can I tic-toc, ah-ha, toc-tic?
No other than my man Slick Nick is on the mix
25 lashes, 35 licks
As I pose in a mackadocious stand
Maybe one day I might have a band
It ain't gonna rain no more no more
It ain't gonna rain no more
Comin this summer, catch us out on tour
I wanna see you (girl next door)
I got more rhymes in store
Watch my hand as I slam the door

[ VERSE 4: Smooth B ]
Smooth B, I'm like a lotus flower, with great power
And all invadin perpetrators I must devour
Excelling to a level in time, not like a vagabond
Not like a rattling snake, I'm not from Babylon
Much like a prince on a throne, within a state of my own
I'm not a kid, I'm grown
Righteously leading a path, my wisdom's shown
Phone calls I'll accept, Smooth, I keep a positive rep
Call me the Tap Dance Man, I never stutter or step
And wrong doing's my mission, it's just influencing you
To benefit, cause I'm legit - and I can't quit
Conversed with prophets on how we must receive our blessings
Studying hard every night, I have reviewed my lessons
And now I'm ready and strong, I'm movin right, not wrong
I'm battling back and forth, like a game of ping-pong
Prevailing victoriously, I must continue to strive
Focussing on destinies to keep my spirit alive

[Verse 1]
I met him in a club hangin' out one night
He said, ""Hello, I'm George...hi, Lyte
How's everything going, huh? How ya doin'?
Hope everything's fine, ooh, and uh umm
Can I call you sometime? Can I get the digits?
And the address, so I can come visit?""
I gave him the digits, that wasn't a problem
'Cause if he caused any, I would have to solve them
'Cause George looked good, MMM, damn good!
And if I didn't, some other girl would
In my mind, I hope for the best
Convincing myself that this was not a test
'Cause I heard many things about Georgie
Nothing kinky, like no orgies
I heard he knows how to make love
Like an angel from the heaven above
Who was I kidding I'd give him a try
'Cause Lyte needs love too and that ain't no lie
Keep your ears open, hope that you listenin'
'Cause I'm about to take you on a George Porgie mission

""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty...""

[Verse 2]
I gave him the number, I saw it in his eyes
""She gave me the number? Hmmm I'm surprised""
Good conversation over the phone
He began to comfort me whenever I was alone
George was sweet, so nice and so neat
With any other guy he didn't have to compete
George was mature, he made sure
That he was the only man I'd ever adore
Girls, have you, ever had a friend
That you'd get with, every now and then?
I know for a fact George had a lot of girls
Spread out from state from state around the world
As long as he was smart and kept his girls in check
Made sure I never saw them and showed me respect
He didn't have to be loyal, like men should be
I don't care about the other girls, just be good to me!
But if I ever saw one, that would be the end
He couldn't kick the storyline that she was just a friend
The girls I didn't care if her ass don't lie
See 'cause Georgie was into making young girls cry

""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""

""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is...""
""Kissed the girls and...""

[Verse 3]
George was clean, no drugs and such
But once in a while, he'd drink too much
Hangin' in a club where they play rockers
Him and his friend, drinkin' vodka
I was looking for him, and I found him there
With his clothes messed up and his (fucked) up hair
I told him he was messin' up, he wouldn't go far
He got mad and asked his friend for the keys to the car
I said, ""Don't drive, use your head
Drive while you're drunk and you'll kill yourself dead""
We begin to argue, bad words were said
Then he got kicked out by some long-haired dread
Ran into the car as if, in a hurry
He started the car but his vision was blurry
He didn't care, he drove off into the night
Riding for miles, without his headlights
Georgie Porgie had too much on his mind
He was still young yet running out of time
Last week he took tests and the doctor told him
George had cancer in his lungs and his colon
See when he was twelve, he started smokin'
Paid no attention when he started chokin'
Thoughts flashed through his head, there they stuck
'Til Georgie Porgie crashed into a truck
I wished I woulda told him how I liked him so much
How he made me feel with the slightest touch
Now he's gone and I can't tell him nothin'
Wish he was here so I could say somethin'
The story is not to say that I'm in sorrow
Just to say no one is promised tomorrow
If you love someone you should say it often
You'll never know when they'll be layin' in a coffin
Wake up, it's important that you know that
No one on Earth is promised tomorrow...
Believe that! And don't think that it can't happen to you

""Kissed the girls and made them cry""
""Kissed the girls and made them cry""

""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is empty without you, babe""
""Can it be I've stayed away too long""
""My world is...""

""Kissed the girls and made them cry""

The Queen is hyped up
The Queen is hyped up
The Queen is hyped up
Ay yo Manda
What's up La?
Yo, people have been trying to get fierce on me
I think it's time I tell them about themselves
Yo, just give it to them Safari Style

Well, well, well
It's the L A the T I the F A H, you'll see why
Q U double E N. Is the reason I must be myself
What else? Well fame hasn't got me
Souped up selling out, sloppy or poppy
There so much to live for, therefore
Here's more from a woman
All women keep the rumors to yourself
The over blown home grown not known
Fools who never shown proof let alone own
A lot of props or a hip hip pop chart
Notch on your clock is my spot
Now who got the marks? I do
Why you little played out
Aa-choo!
I'm allergic to wack crews
The La, the ti, the fah
The queen is up
Throwing salt that you never seen before
How dare those who talk we can't have them
Some make me wanna go out with the bat and a magnum
But a wise, civilized and growing higher
Judgments from the Queen punishment is the fire
I'M here to make these fools out of liars
You must learn step and respect the sire, face the fire
Latifah had it up to here the frauds felling fear, fear
The sound is playing like a Q-tip digging your ear ear
Mama Zula stands for positivity, knowledge and grace
I never run my piece Damn! I'll take it to your face
Open why you hoping none stutter stop 'em
Maybe choke (choke)
Because it's very hard to breathe while La got you in a yolk
I'll cut your throat, I'll cut it short
No one ever getting near
Latifah's had it up to here

[Chprus]

Give it to 'em Queen (I got it)

Give it to 'em Queen, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to 'em Queen (I got it)
Give it to em Queen, yeah, yeah, yeah
The Queen L A T I F A H in command

Some of these commercial entertainers
Are commercially a pain to my mind and my behind
Try to dis Dana, bumping me off
Because the Queen has reached a certain plateau
All I do is boo and say ""Is that so?""
Talk is cheap and if talk got any cheaper
They'd be selling Nike tongues instead of sneakers
Kay sa rah sa rah, blazay blah, etcetera
This is a scene from the Queen La, La
Lovely and lyrically loose, but lady like
Im too slick to slip up or get tricked by the shady type
Chomps y'all talk and still wonder how loose I got
When Im in town I give the boosters booster shots
Breaks breaks, face face, never never, waste waste
Your mind on a rhyme
That will get thrown in your fronting face
I'll cut your throat, I'll cut it short
No one ever getting near
Latifah's had it up to here

[Chorus]

Royal and loyal
Face the fire boy
You wouldn't get the time of the day
So make way, hey, silence I say
Lay low and have a cold one
Cause the whipping I'm dishing is an old one
I through some soul into my morning bowl then I rolled
I took your gold and stopped your singled
Cause it never ever sold
Matter of fact it never even got the time to sprout
So you could never give me body or come in my house
The flavor unit is doing it back again this year
How many flavors of the flavor can you love to hear
Feel the force of my holocaust I'm staring at ya
Put in a bid on who will fall I'm sure to match ya
Snatch ya stature
Your broken looks more like a fracture
Catch that rapper
Latifah will be back to crush ya
Go buy a heart
Cause from the start I told ya no one getting near
Latifah's had it up to here

[Chprus]

Give it to 'em Queen, who got it?
Give it to 'em Queen Latifah
Give it to 'em Queen, who got it?
Give it to 'em Queen, the flavor unit

Give it to 'em Queen, I got it
Give it to 'em Queen, Latifah
Give it to 'em Queen, DJ A D
Give it to 'em Queen, ease off
Give it to 'em Queen

[Outro]

L A, L A T I F A H in command
Give it to 'em Queen

[Intro]
Ahh, I know I'm drunk now
Ladies and gentlemen, I for-I forgot my
My favorite man, sittin' over there
His name is...

[Hook]
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina

Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mista Dobalina, Mr. Bob Dobalina
Mr. Bob Dobalina

[Verse 1]
Mista Dobalina, Mista Bob Dobalina
Mista Bob Dobalina, won't you quit?
You really make me sick with ya fraudulent behavior
You're gonna make me flip and then an army couldn't save ya
Why don't you behave ya little rugrat?
Take a little tip from the tabloid, because I know I'm not paranoid
When I say I saw ya tryin' to mock me
Now you and your crew are on a mission tryin' to hawk me
But it isn't happenin' ya fraudulent foes
You used to front big time now I suppose
That everything's cool since the style of apparel you adopted
You used to make fun of but now you wanna rock it
So you gotta kick it with the homies
But D-E-L is already hip to your cronies
Me and CM-PX thought about this and never have we seen a
Brother who could hover Mista, Mista, Mista Dobalina

[Bridge 2]
Ooh, ooh, Mista Dobalina, you thought ya could manipulate
You thought you could fool me, ooh, ooh, Mista Dobalina
Teacher used to put me on a stump
And then he schooled me

[Verse 2]
Friends can be fraudulent, just you wait and see
First he was my moneygrip then he stole my honeydip
Mista Dobalina is a serpent, don't you agree?
The little two-tima resembles Aunt Jemima
With jeans and a dirty white hoodie
Seems like he wouldn't be a snake or would he?
Disguises come in all sizes and shapes
Notice the facade of the snakes
They all catch the vapes, even though last year they was GQ
Took a lot of time before the D-E-L could see through
The mask, all I had to do was ask Hemperor and Kwamé
And my man responded they would bomb a
Fraudulent foe with the strength of Hercules
The way ya on my dick must really hurt ya knees
You need to take heed and quit being such a groupie
Ever since I did a little show in Guadeloupee
I neva saw a groupie like you
But what is funny is ya wanted to be down with my crew
But D-E-L is not down with any clowns or jesters
So I would suggest that you try to impress Uncle Fester, Dobalina
Because ya don't impress me Dobalina
The style of dress is not the key Dobalina
It's all in the mind and the heart, so you should start
By remembering ya gotta pay a fee Dobalina

Doctor: Nurse Johnson, is the mother still in the recovery room?
Nurse: Yes, Dr. Blair
Doctor: OK, I'll go to the waiting room and inform the father it's a boy
Nurse: I'm afraid there is no father, sir
Doctor: Another ghetto bastard, huh?
Nurse: I'm afraid so
Doctor: Well, put him with the rest of the born losers
Nurse: All right doctor, a shame isn't it?
Doctor: Not a shame, a problem

Smooth it out
This is a story about the drifter
Who waited for the worst, cause the best lived 'cross town
Who never planned on having so didn't
Why me, huh

Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)

[Verse 1: Treach]
Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, motherfuck the fag
Well anyway, I did pick ups, lift and click-ups
Too many stick-ups, cause niggas had the trigger hiccups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us all, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip with just a clip, who wanna hit
They got 'em quick, I had to eat, this money's good as spent
A 'do in braids, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long cause I couldn't afford a haircut
I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a Tec and a banana clip
Was down to throw the lead to any telling crackhead
I'd still'a been broke, so a lot of good it woulda did
Or done, if not for bad luck, I would have none
Why did I have to live a life of such a bad one
Why when I was a kid and played I was a sad one
And always wanted to live like this or that one

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Treach]
A ghetto bastard, born next to the projects
Living in the slums with bums, I said, ""now why, Treach""
""Do it have to be like this""
Momma said I'm priceless
So I am all worthless, starved, and it's just what being nice gets
Sometimes I wish I could afford a pistol then, though
To stop the hell, I would've ended things a while ago
I ain't have jack but a black hat and knapsack
War scars, stolen cars, and a blackjack
Drop that, and now you want me to rap and give?
Say something positive?
Well positive ain't where I live
I live right around the corner from West Hell
Two blocks from South Shit and once in a jail cell
The sun never shone on my side of the street, see
And only once or twice a week I would speak
I walked alone, my state of mind was home sweet home
I couldn't keep a girl, they wanted kids with cars and chrome
Some life, if you ain't wear gold your style was old
And you got more juice and dough for every bottle sold
Hell no, I say there's gotta be a better way
But hey, never gamble in a game that you can't play
I'm slowin' and flowin' and going in on and knowing not now
How will I do it, how will I make it
I won't, that's how
Why me, huh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Treach]
My third year into adulthood, and still a knucklehead
I'm better off dead huh, that's what my neighbor said
I don't do jack but fighting, lightin' up the streets at night
Playing hide-and-seek with a machete sexing Freddy's wife
Some say I'm rolling on, nothing but a dog now
I answer that with a ""fuck you"" and a bow-wow
Cause I done been through more shit within the last week
Than a fly flowing in doo-doo on the concrete
I been a deadbeat, dead to the world and dead wrong
Since I was born that's my life, oh you don't know this song
So don't say jack, and please don't say you understand
All that man-to-man talk can walk, damn
If you ain't live it, you couldn't feel it, so kill it skillet
And all that talk about it won't help it out, now will it?
In Illtown, pure luck got stuck-up, props got shot
Don't worry got hit by a flurry, and his punk-ass dropped
But I'm the one who has been labeled as an outcast
They teach in schools, I'm the misfit y'all will outlast
But that's cool with the fool, smack 'em backwards
That's what you get for fucking with a ghetto bastard

[Outro]
If you ain't ever been to the ghetto
Don't ever come to the ghetto
Cause you wouldn't understand the ghetto
And stay the fuck out of the ghetto
Why me (alright)

[Verse 1]
I seen her in the subway, on my way to Brooklyn
Hello, good lookin', is this seat tooken?
On the A-train, picking at her brain
I couldn't get her number, I couldn't get her name
(I'm curious) I said I still like your style of fashion
But I hate your high sadity attitude with a passion
Is it because brothers like to hawk a lot?
Is it because you're shy'n don't talk a lot?
She turned away, no play, I said okay
You don't really look good, I hope you have a bad day
Sat back, relaxed though the ride was tight
I was thinking of the rhymes I wrote last night
Next stop was mine, a familiar scene
I was meeting my friend, Killer Ben in Fort Greene
Where the girls are real, they tell ya how they feel
If you're soft, you're soft, or if you're hard like steel
See I don't bend and I won't rust
And I don't break and I won't bust
Stomped up the street and did I hear a treat?
Hard high heels tappin' on the concrete
I took a peek, it was the girl from the train behind me
Did she live in the area, was she trying to find me?
Hmm, I didn't wanna play myself out
I played it off, stopped and I bought a Guinness Stout
Now was she shy, she didn't walk by
She came in the store then she even said 'hi'
Curiosity, at a high velocity
Maybe possibly she had the hots for me
I said, ""if we're playing games then we're gonna play mine
I'm a lay the rules cause it ain't much time
If you hide your feelings, and they hard to find
I wanna know what's on your mind""

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
About a week went by and I called her, ""Hello""
I said yo, can I speak to, um, she said no
Hey yo, I know I didn't call, I didn't wanna stress you
Go out my way to impress you, press to undress you
See I wanna get to know you so I can show you
What a strong relationship can grow to
But you gotta trust me and you're gonna love me
Squeeze the phone and hug me, use your mind to rub me
Now how does it feel
When my mental, massage ya temple
Telephone's hot from the vibes that I sent you
Now tell me your inner thoughts and deepest emotions
Next you see ecstacy's explosions
Now I'm coming to see you to spend some time
I'm a romantic warrior, but is it a crime
And if you hide your feelings and they hard to find
I wanna know what's on your mind

[Hook]
I wanna know what's on your mind

[Verse 3]
Now it's been months and it's smooth and lovely
I'm in your head so you'll be thinking of me
So we met in Queens and went to Valley Streams
And, uh, couldn't remember the movie we just seen
But it's Wednesday, take the train uptown
How do the 125th street sound
Amateur night, Showtime at the Apollo
Probably be watching Bill Cosby tomorrow
Then after that get into it, I mean intimate
Every word is an instrument
Making sounds and tones and songs and moans
My lips so close to your ear, it's like headphones
You smile, you said you never know what the day will bring
It's always a new song to sing
The next day I went back to the her rest
Knocked on the door, intentions: finesse
She let me in and had nothing but a negligee on
Smelling like Liz Claiborne
I sat down and got comfortable and watched the Huxtables
She sat next to me and said what's up wit you
I got the feeling for sexual healing
A mental healing; how you feeling
She caught the effect and said she feel the same
Could you massage my intellect and stop the pain
Desire's yearning, the fire's burning
You hot cause it's a lot you're learning
Now I'm ready to explore you inner world
It's take a long time cause I'm just beginning, girl...
Take it easy, cut off the TV
Cut off the lights, use your mind to see me
Use your physical form if I'm hard to find
Cause now I know what's on your mind

Cause now I know what's on your mind

(Chorus: 4x)

Burn Shamrock, burn

Oochie coochie girls, big booms, hard rhymes
Shamrock is here to form a strike line
All they wanna do is just stab the wound
And after the pantie's, they'll be singin another tune

(MC Brains)
Rick, rockin the instrumentals non stop

(Shamrock)
Ohio ho's, he's the chief rocker
Motown bound, C-Town, he likes to mingle

We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound
Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda or your Beemer or your Legend or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make you unball your fist
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
So low-key that you probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed
So raise up squire, adjust your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed
Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
I don't really mind if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher
And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer

[Hook]
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
How's about that, it seems like it's my turn again
All through the years my mic has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it?
Some even wanna dis me, but why sweat it?
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes
Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another? I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah, so whom shall I fear
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare
So jet to the store, and buy the LP
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers
So the new shit can rock, from Bronx to Massapequa
Cause where I come from quality is job one
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done
So peace to that crew, and peace to this crew
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut
Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline
The jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass
Cause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz
It's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground
And the ones six below, you didn't have to go
Some say that I'm eccentric cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
If this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask
""What's wrong?"" - now check it out
All my peoples in Queens ya don't stop
Now all my peoples in Brooklyn ya don't stop
And all my peoples uptown ya don't stop
That includes the Bronx and Harlem ya don't stop
Now to that girl Ramelle ya don't stop
I said because Ladies First ya don't stop
And to the JB's, ya don't stop
And De La Soul, ya don't stop
To my Brand Nubians ya don't stop
And to my Leaders of the New ya don't stop
To my man Large Professor ya don't stop
Pete Rock for the beat ya don't stop
Everybody in the place ya don't stop
You keep it on, to the rhythm, ya don't stop
And last but not least on the sure shot
It's the Zulu nation

[Verse 1: Grand Puba]
I hit a beat and swing a note as if my name was David Ruffin
Quick to toast an MC just like an English muffin
Don't worry about a thing because the Puba's never bluffing
I gets headaches from the wack, so then I take a Bufferin and I max
I wait until the opportune time and then I tax but should I max?
Now they say sinning is for sinners so I guess I'm not a sinner
Beginning's for beginners so I guess I'm no beginner
This is how I spark it, money in my pocket
When it comes to having pleasure I gets hard as a rocket
MC Grand Pu coming through all the residue
The songs remain classics dating back to the Babalu
My boys I call 'em Akh, the foes I let 'em jock
And I can think of many episodes I swung in Lincoln Park
No I'm not a phony and I got a tenderoni
Love the way she is - not too fat, not too bony
Don't drink Sanka, won't sink like a tanker
Knock the boots off a skirt in Casablanca and I thank her
Some rappers stink like Englebert Humperdinck
Better yet Dick Cavett, I got a bad habit
Similar to the girl on She's Gotta Have It
I think with the brain and I whip behind the zipper
I'm living kinda good similar to Jack Tripper
A landlord named Roper did a show at the Copa
When I'm finished with this I'll be paid like Oprah
So if honey wants to act fly
I'll just play like Guy and I'm (saying, ""bye, bye, dumb bitch!"")
Stick out your thumb and hitch
Cause you've been cut off like a light switch
See I'm programmed to slam winter, summer, spring or fall
Before I do a show I get some kicks out the mall
Then I get my gear and I give Trev a call
Cause he works in the barbershop, right behind the mall
Other rappers tried to rob me but you know they got did
To put it blunt, honey I shrunk the kids
So bookers back off break North here comes the regulator
Betcha that you find none greater

[Verse 2: Sadat X]
On file is a style, that's why you caught a clip
My suitcases is packed and I'm going on a trip
To Mic-a-delphia I go for self and still be slamming
The school bell is ringing and I caught somebody cramming
For the test, oh yes, my study guide was thick
I cut you with my verbal, didn't hurt you just a nick
Off your face, don't play possum watch me and I'll blossom
Like a rose and get some new clothes
And a fresh fade from Rob
Jump on the phone and dial the Now Rule Mob
Now come one, come all, we about to get hectic
If my crew don't get in, then the X makes a exit
To the rear, I'm outta here, don't front on my brothers
I take care of them before I take care of others
Now wood bats is doomed, in the 90's it's aluminum
Step to the stage with a mic and I'm doing 'em something awful
I'm a citizen and I'm lawful
I go to Hunter in the fall, rip the policemen's ball
I got the power to make a car stall
I get some drinks from Glackens, and when the crowd slackens
I stop drinking and then I start thinking about
Days in the past when Derek X was last
But now I'm on the top, damn, news travels fast
Cause I'm like that, they can't see this
Read my book, it contains many pieces of verses
I took the time to delete all the curses
So moms reach deep in your purses
And buy me take me home and try me and do me well

[Verse 3: Lord Jamar]
Well, while I reign rhymes pour
You suck it up like a straw and jump on the dance floor
Cause every time I step in a jam
I make like a door and slam
But then girls try to turn my knob cause I'm a heart throb
I guess it's just a hazard that comes with the job
Cause every time I rock a rhyme that shows Jamar is intellectual
Girls want to get sexual
Well I guess I have to cope with being so dope
You want to be me, but can't see me with a telescope
You seek and search but still you can't find
You're weak and it hurts to be deaf, dumb and blind
A supreme mind will take you out of your paralysis
I grip the mic so tight I get callouses
And your analysis is that the Lord
Whips rhymes into shape with a mic cord
I do it good cause I'm a positive black man
Eating up suckers as if I was PacMan
Not a Dapper Dan fan, I stay casual
To rock like the J it comes gradual
You got to know the ledge to wise the dumb
And understand your culture of freedom
Power equally with the Gods
So you can build and born your cipher
All your life you must teach truth
Of the true and living God, not a mystery spook
And when you do that, pursue that goal
Which made the student enroll and only then you'll prosper

Accept my Black, so how the hell you diss Pink?
And yet you wanna' be down, clown
So many wanna' be down, with the illogical ark
Steppin' through your cave-boy crew
Your nest of war, with your bald hair-do!
Media weapons!
News at 11!
Paper at 6 or systematic tricks
And that's why I do what I do
Say how I feel so you get it on the real
True, true, any rapper will subdue
Try to test some buddy business
And submit my whole crew
The front page, says outrage
There's no gauge, cause it's time for the MAC!
Tune in your radio, video, stereo and all that
To the vibes of the pro-Black
It's like that as I wind up my wrist
Check out the smack of the scientific fist
But on a level to the East I flow
Cause with Freedom or Death, there's no choice, you know?
Still on the topic of the P-R-O
When I pass my verb-stick to brother P-X-O

[Professor X]
Over and under as I progress to this
Got no time to be hanging out with humanists
Raise a flag, fly the, tag the hand, clutch the fist
Serve we nationally comes the diss
Humanity keep it with the sweet-bread eaters
Milwaukee, the brutality, how can you dismiss?
So, off to the road we go you know
Follow the pro-nigga flow
Off to the road you know we go
Follow the pro-nigga flow
For you and yours, legislation
Past-purpose agitation
By way of the old order - emancipation
Zoom, zoom, zoom revelation
Cometh pro-Black dedication
The solution: revolution
Evolution
The conclusion: the trigger!
Please, a let me take a swigger
And if you don't get any bigger
Yes, I'm that kind of nigga!

[J] Yeah! To the East, my brother, to the East!
[X] To the East, my brother, to the East!
[J] Come on! To the East, my brother, to the East! Yeah!
[X] To the East, my brother, to the East!
[J] To the East, my brother, to the East! Yeah!
[X] To the East, my brother, to the East, my brother
To the East, my brother, to the East!

[Brother J]
Yeah!
Revolution, evolution, the solution
No amendments, and burn the Constitution
You take the authors, a bunch of old wig-ers
Who strategized extinction of the poor, Black niggas
Know why? Cause I'm that nigga that they can't stand
That teach an African how to say, ""Black man!""
And I'm that nigga they can plainly see
With the nationalist colors of the red, black, green
Yeah! I'm the one who cut Tarzan's vine
Ran his ass out the jungle with his homeboy swine
One of those brothers that they just can't find
That makes 'em shake and make 'em shiver when it comes nighttime
Yeah! A boom-bap with a pro-Black slap
The old systematic dues
All Irish do Japs. Yeah!
You hear me? Boy, you'd better make way!
Enough action and totally nothing to say
And here's a message to the Rainbow crew
And their fearless leader, Captain Human:
Revolution is not humanism!
Individualism and not separatism!
Hey! Point blank, living-ism is a tank
Cause there's just some things that I never forget:
I remember green suits on a Black mayor;
I remember nine-millimeter child slayers;
I remember all the times that you called me an animal
But in Milwaukee there's a cannibal
Check it! Some of the things that you just don't figure
Cause it gets a lot Blacker and a whole lot bigger
No matter, nightstick or bring your big trigger
Our nation is protected by some pro-Black niggas!

[Professor X]
Making note of some minors. I'm not talking baseball, cause if I was
Brother J, we'd be playing professional. There nine innings to a
Baseball game. By the way: Is it humanity? Or is it vanity?
Vainglorious! This is protected, by the red, the black, and the
Green, with the key! On the road again. Sissy! And ya' don't stop!

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
I testified, my mama cried
Black people died when the other man lied
See the TV, listen to me double trouble
I overhaul and I'm coming from the lower level
I'm taking tabs, sho nuff stuff to grab
Like shirts and it hurts with a neck to wreck
Took a poll cause our soul took a toll
From the education of a TV station
But look around, here go the sound of the wrecking ball
Boom and pound when I shut 'em down

[Hook x8]
Shut 'em down
Shut 'em down, shut 'em shut 'em down

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
What I use in the battle for the mind
Hit it hard like it supposed
Pulling no blows to the nose
Like Uncle L said I'm ripping up shows
Then what it is is only 5 percent of the biz
I'm adding woes, that's the way it goes
Then you think I rank I never drank, point blank
I own loans, suckers got me running from the bank
Civil liberty I can't see to pay a fee
I never saw a way to pay a sap to read the law
Then become a victim of a lawyer
Don't know ya, never saw ya
Tape cued, getting me sued
Playing games with my head, what the judge said
Put me in the red, got me thinking 'bout a trigger to the lead
No, no, my educated mind say
Suckers gonna pay anyway, there gonna be a day
Cause the troop they roll in, to posse up whole from the ground
Ready to go, throw another round
Sick of the ride, it's suicide for the other side of town
When I find a way to shut 'em down

[Hook x8]

[Verse 3: Chuck D]
Who count the money in the neighborhood
But we spending money to no end, looking for a friend
In a war to the core, ripping up the poor in the stores
Until they get a brother kicking down doors
Then I figure I can get bigger
Look 'em dead in the eye and they wince, defense is pressurized
They don't really want it to be another racial attack
In disguise so give some money back
I like Nike but wait a minute
The neighborhood supports, so put some money in it
All corporations owe, they gotta give up the dough
To my town or else we gotta shut 'em down

[Hook x8]

[Outro]
Howdy y'all. This is Bernie Crosshouse, yours truly of the KKK. I'd like to express our deepest gratitude at the destruction of the inferior nigga race. And I’m especially pleased to report it's destroyin' itself without our help. To all you gangs, hoodlums, drug pushers and users, and other worthless niggers killin' each other, we’d like to thank y'all for savin' us the time, trouble and legality for the final chapter of riddin' y'all off the face of the Earth. Your solution to our problem is greatly appreciated, so keep sellin' us your soul. Thank ya!

[Intro:]
What you pullin' me over fo' mistuh offi-suh?
I'll be askin' the questions Leroy
My name ain't Leroy, man
Heh, all right Jerome, outta the car
Man, why I gotta be Jerome man? Why can't I be Tommy or Philbert or something?
Just put your hands on the hood Muhammad

[Verse 1:]
It's the man that you love to hate
Coming outta Washington state
Cops don't like my profile
Cause Mixalot kicks much style
So the man is on my trail
He wanna take Mix to jail
If he does, I'll make the bail
Cause I know alot of rich females
I'm shakin' 'em just like this
Keepin' that Porsche in fifth
King County cops don't quit
Even when a young brothers legit
So they follow me wherever I go
I hear 'em on the radio
With a scanner that I bought from the sto'
Cause a brother like Mix gotta know
I'm checkin' them cops with radar
They don't believe I'm a rap star
That my brain is up to par
An I'm ready when they follow my car
I know they wanna spray me with mace
Cause my trunk keeps pumpin' much bass
But they best get outta my face
Cause one-times got no case, give it to me

[Hook:]
One-times got no case

[Verse 2:]
The police think I'm movin' them keys
They trip cause I clock much D
They pull a gat an' they yell out ""Freeze!""
I'm whippin' out my I.D
My gat sits under my seat
The cops throw me out in the street
They found my gun like thieves
Officer Friendly has got a new beat
So I show him my gun permit
I told him I roll legit
Give me a test to see if I'm drinkin'
They claim my breath was stinkin'
They had me walk on the line
I walked backwards stopped on a dime
My female just reclines
Cause she knows I know the time
I'm hip to the cop procedure
They get ya everytime they see ya
They stop ya, they cuff ya
They roll ya an' they rough ya
They ask what I do for a livin'
Should this information be given?
This is what keeps me driven
Some cops want a brother in prison
So I got me a few attorneys
Just in case a cop wanna burn me
They protect me from the state
Cause one-time's got no case, break it on down

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
A cop asks me ""What's my name, and don't lie""
And I'm askin' officer ""Why?
Why ya wanna mess with a brother like Mix
When you know I'm livin' legit?""
The cop said ""Don't get smart
I tear soul-brothers apart""
I said ""Well take off your gun, if you wanna get done
An' I'll show you that I ain't the one""
The cop rolled up his fist
Puts the handcuffs on my wrists
Then he threw a straight jab and he missed
A female cop pulls up and she's pissed
But this cop had K-9
A soul sister, yes she's fine
I said ""Won't ya help a brother outta bind?""
But that badge was going to her mind
So she stuck a billy club in my back
She said ""Don't think because you're black
That I won't beat you"", crack, ""hit you with the gat""
Her partner starts to laugh

Oooh, hit 'em again. Hit 'em again

So they took me on down to the jail
P.L.B. came to pay my bail
Then we called Goldstein and Claire
Them's my lawyers
Walkin' up the stairs
To the courtroom dressed in suits
'Bout to give a couple cops the boot
So the female cop takes the stand
Took her oath with the wrong damn hand
My lawyers ate her up like catfish
The other cop pleads the fifth
She lost her job
I seen a few tears on her face
Sorry baby, one-time's got no case

317,2995,Fu-Schnickens,Ring The Alarm,21,1992-02-15,"

Ring the alarm, another sound is dying, whoa, aye
(3x)

Ring the alarm, I don't wanna stay calm cause
I'm about to rip this psalm
When the mic is gripped my lyrics do split up like
Bombs from Vietnam
Cause I'm sweet, neat, I don't romp or skinteet
Lyrics I lick with my tongue
And rhymes I nymn with my teeth
This lyrical prophet you can't stop this from the West Indies
You can tell I'm a lyrical prophet from the words spoken and broken up
In these books and scrolls that I unfold
The knowledge I use does make me bold
The intelligence in my system
Converts itself and becomes wisdom
Born in Trinidad, not Tobogo, land of steel pan and calypso
Cyop is a buck and a buck is a cyop
That's the real true thing and a natural fact
This lyrical man you can't hold me back
From the red, the white, and also the black
Island, which is my land, my place of birth
You can tell by the tongue that's swung
And the lyrical structure in me verse
So all MC's don't cross this border
Cause by now you should know sort of
Lyrically wise but now I despise
All youth that's out of order
Don't try to test any of the Schnikens
Cause I'm not done with the lyrical boxin'
The beatin' and the lickin'

Ring the alarm, another sound is dying, whoa, aye
(3x)

You two-facety, you can't face me
And my rhymes you'll bite and learn
Soon you'll acknowledge my lyrical substance just like a bookworm
Chip FU, then you will extend and show all the youth them
That me big boutcha under roots and culture
And the bad bull in the pen
Because when I grip the mic (yes, man)
All MC's they do stop yes and hush
Any mic I touch, any mic I brush, any mic I clutch
With these lyrical styles of such
And if I do unleash a lyrical masterpiece
Lyrics never cease, then a piece I'll unleash and make it brief
Please don't bite yes or thief
C-H-I-P FU is my name, it will stay just the same
Give me any mic on stage in a rage I'll engage
And drop rhymes just the same
Quote for quote, note for note, did you comphrehend
So jack it up and pull it up operator
Wheel and come again
Cause MC's try these rastafarianic raps and sound like wanna-be's
But a wanna-be's not what I want to be
See the FU-Schnickens have to be
The true prophets free
Free to preach FU-Schnick prophecies
We thee untouchable, matchable, stoppable MC's for unity
Me, a rastafarian, no not me but I do stun
I'm not faking Jamacian, so all MC's you better run
Because Mr. Chip FU man a come
And me sitdong pon de riddim sitdong pion de vibes
A de hartical don
True me full up a style and me wicked and wild
With peer pattern watch how me chat it in a verb
And capsize it in a noun
Uno better give I and I respect
When this Trinidadian I come
Sing out

Ring the alarm, another sound is dying, whoa, aye
(3x)

Phenomenon one, phenomenon two, phenomenon three
Come follow me
POC FU's the rough-neck chicken and I'm the wild Apache
See I'm the C the H the I the P
Down with the P the O the C, the K the U the N the G
The M the O, yes and the C
And when the M the I the C is in my H the A-N-D
I preach and teach and educate all ghetto youth about unity
But wait, let me get set not to sweat
But to get something straight
All MC's come out with good styles
And all of them do sound great
But ring the alarm and don't stay calm
Because I won't procrastinate
These lyrical styles that I compile
To preach and teach and educate me
A new jack brother (who's that)
When you were at the parties rapping and scratching I did a chat
On tape, on tape and cassette, you'll hear me live and direct
Yes and who never hear me yet when you hear my voice it's perfect
So just pack up because your lyrics are weak when you speak
Don't step so just back up, wake up, take off the make-up
The mic because I'll break up
MC's limbs from limb, slim me trim
You see me, I don't follow no style and I don't follow no pattern
So take head to this lesson I bring or the lesson I brought
Which was taught to one and another
All slack MC's better ring the alarm
In other words, run for cover

[Busta Rhymes]
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
It's a sunny day and the sky is bright
Chickens in the mist everything is right
No need to make bets cause I'm not a bookie
Today is the day the whole school plays hookie
Why? Cause I called Dinco D and Brown
Cut Monitor Milo brings the sound
Before I do that I play myself like a jerk
Make sure mama jama took her body to work
Okay she is gone so I jet to the phone
Let the whole world know nobody's home
It's Busta Rhymes and I'm feeling irie
Come on over cause I'm having a party
Milo did the right thing and brought the vibe
The sound's too pissed now the party's live
Chicken's in effect, everything is sweet
As I zoned in my rest all I had to say is
That beat, that beat, just keep the same old beat
Check it out y'all, come on, come on
Just keep the same old beat

[Dinco D]
On the fourth day of school, hookie wasn't here
Today's the first day of a brand new year
There's girls that's rubbing butts around the room
Fellas feeling good cause the gates is boom
Zoom to the doom of a sugarplum tune
Me, Brown and Busta gonna rock the mic soon
With a huh! here we go in June
Powercat with the snap to bend the rules
No-one misses out, this is all street news
You choose, don't lose abuse
Prices move in like crews of brews
Stacked on a four pack sack of freaks
I guess I'll play hookie for a couple of weeks

[Charlie Brown]
6 A.M. and I hear my alarm
Rush to the phone and call Vietnam
He sleeps so I leave a message
At the tone, you know time is of essence
Quickly I jump straight into the shower
The baby powder, cause I can't smell sour
Get dressed, put on my Nike Airs
Comb my hairs, go upstairs
Walk outside to the fruit stand
Andre, Kenny, the 40's in hand
Powercat Geronimo is in the distance
The fifths are coming, the fifths are coming
Hit up, lit up the blunt and I'm straight
Quarter to eight and my day looks great
Walk to the school with about 40 feet
That means the squad is 20 deep
I zoned

Zone Coaster (The International...) (Repeat 6x)

[Busta Rhymes]
Finally by now the whole crew's in the house
Brown just came and he's roaming about
Music just start but yo where is Milo?
Got a chicken in the room and he's trying to hide, yo
Next is my man (Who?) Gary Gennew
Half of the rum and a case of brews
Rumpletilz with the Diggum Smacks
And then through the door came the Cracker Jacks
Posse from Medina cold looking very hard
Next through the door came the yardman squad
Into the crib to find the entry at last
Kallie and the crew with my boy Shabazz
Chickens think they're iller time to settle the score
Dom Powercat threw the lock on the door
Bugging at the jam like I'm cyclone and
Snapped out of a seven hour nap come to find out that I'm zoning
Huh, check it out, yeah

[Dinco D]
No school? Cool
I'll just fool around off school grounds
Too many kids doing bids in detention
I'm just chilling, what is this they mention?
L.O.N.S. to the set, look he has a gun
'91 is fun, lots of baked buns
Prepare to wind to a reggae cut
Knock knock, who, what
Mom, a bomb, sound the alarm
Leave the dance before she causes some harm
I go out the back door with a hard bone
Look at the clock and then I start to zone

[Charlie Brown]
Got to the hive, no one was there
Truant officers began to stare
Called Dinco D but he's not home
Drop another quarter into the phone
Call Busta Rhymes, what's up my man?
(Having a party, understand?)
Where's Dinco D, you know, the D?
(Here's the phone) (What's up C.B.?)
I'm coming (Hurry up, hurry up!)
Milo started throwing on all the cuts
Walking to the crib and I heard ""Hello""
Turned, it was Epitome and Shamello
Told them the scoop and I kept stepping
Almost had to stop then I started sweating
Rob pulls up, he says ""Come on get in""
Place it was packed with stupid skins
Got to Busta's crib and grabbed a 40
Cracker Jacks have it naughty naughty
Grabbed the gold tone microphone
Woke up Saturday, I zoned

[Hook]
(Mad brothers know his name) (Yeah, it's him again) Repeat 4x

[Verse 1]
Lord Finesse got something for your eardrums
Back on the scene, long time, no hear from
It's the funky man, the brother with the same sound
I've been coolin about a year and some change now
So hand over the microphone cause it's my turn
The brother with a fade, half-moon, and long sideburns
Nice, dope, and keep the girls scoping
Say the funky shit and get all the niggas open
So heed that, don't try to yap and give me feedback
I'll get in that ass, believe that
Can it, I'll steal your show like a bandit
I get papes while you're broke like mass transit
You're not as smooth as this, so what can you do with this
Brothers need to stop and step with that foolishness
I'm the type to interrupt a party
I don't need a phone to reach out and touch somebody
Gimme a mic, it's just as good as one
Leave the party is what you wack MC's should of done
Cause y'all starving, I'm living extra large and
I'm swinging shit as if my name was Tarzan
Yeah, cause I'm on some old new shit
Got more styles than you see in a Kung Fu flick
Mic the seas, wax opponents off with ease
I'm more deadly than a venerial disease
So think twice, those who think I'mma fall
I'm shining more than a tire full of Armor All
It's Lord Finesse and I got shit planned
Hot damn, it's the Return of the Funky Man

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Brothers get cash, but I get way more
In the 90's, I'm getting paid for
Rhyme and envy, 21st century
When asked, ""Who's the funkiest?"" You better mention me
I go all out while a lot of crews be fronting
I know and they know that they can't do me nothing
Cause I'm smooth and wise, the skills I utilize
Lyrics all advanced you'd think my brain was computerized
So who needs a partner or a sidekick?
When it comes to being funky, I got all that old fly shit
The rough and rugged, plus the pimp smooth rhyme
I polish opponents off like a shoe shine
They be fronting like they on the crazy tip
Trying to hang but they softer than baby shit
Fronting like they wild with they bullshit style
I'll put they ass on trial, pull they card and they file
I'm hardcore, but I still keep the scene pumping
So all that singing and dancing, that shit don't mean nothing
MC's suffer Lord Finnese lately
Some of them hate me, think that they can take me
I'll take on some of them, bring a whole ton of them
I'll take em all on and stomp each and every one of them
I just chill, relax and flaunt my cash
You wanna riff, I'll be quit to stomp that ass
And let you know that you can't get with this
Come one come all and get burnt by the quickness
Greater, creator, drop stupid data
If I ever got served it had to be by a waiter
I lounge in the rest until my song is done
I plan to be straight with papes in the long run
Cause when it comes to rhymes I give you more than you ask for
Bring a whole task force, I rhyme my fucking ass off
I stand in command with the mic in my hand
Aw shit, it's the Return of the Funky Man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Stand back, I'm about to flip here
Got dissed last year so I kick ass this year
Brothers were stressing me, strictly overworking me
(They showed you last year) Yeah, that fits perfectly
Cool, cause I'm still kinda fed with them
Who gives a fuck, I'm about 20 steps ahead of them
Now I'm established, they feel all embarrassed
Cause I'm with Warner Brothers and my man Gary Harris
Spread the news or should I say buzz?
(Finesse is paid!) Thought I wasn't when I was
The last label was confusing me, jerking me, fooling me
Now that I'm paid, you know what y'all can do for me
Since I sound funky a lot of labels want me
But I'll be damned to be another man's flunky
I can never be a stool pidgeon, I'd rather be a full pidgeon
Fuck the bullshitting
Cause in the 90's I got more than a little game
I'm Lord Finesse and funky is my middle name
Plus my title and everyone wants mine
It's the brother with the compounds and punchlines
I can still put my foot all in your ass
I'm smooth and funky plus smoother than Teddy Pendergrass
It's the man to put words in a simile
(He's a funky technician) Yeah, y'all remember me
I'm real and actual, the man out taxing you
I got rhymes and Mike got a scratch or two
So ain't no use trying to eat us for din-din
Brothers better off trying their luck with Win-Ten
To the opposition: I'm the man out burning ya
I dust a rapper off like furniture
So take our stand, I foil your plan
Goddamn, it's the Return of the Funky Man

Against the D-O-G

But you tried to jerk him like a sucker
That's why he's larger than you dumb muthafuckas
And if there was a repercussion, there was no discussion

All those tracks you made
Fuck your grade cause your shit is played
Dis me, why bother
Stepping to me, you rather step to your father
Yea, and I'm all that
And NWA is crazy wack
Peace to Ice Cube, peace to Ice-T

Then want to wax that ass
And send you back to hardcore class

Step to a man wit the clan at hand
Ina masterplan, shit, Godam
Lethal weapon, rhymes are def and

Word is born

Ha ha hee hee, BlastMaster KRS-One be
Ripping up MC's with their meaningless words, y'know
There's more wit, to one of my turds of shit
You ain't shit, you never was shit
So I spit, on your number one hit, now quit!
Leave the poetry, it's just too strong for thee
Maybe we should rethink the strategy see
Poetry I speak, fluently I think youse a sucker
Cause the only word you know
Is motherfucker
Yo, you don't see a whole race in bondage
No, you grab the microphone and feed em garbage
Yo, everything about me is fresher than fresher
Than fresher than fresh, of COURSE it's KRS
Flashing lyrics, metaphysics, unlike you idiots
Be doing, I'm pursuing, chewing your whole crew
And what you feel like doin, your face they be ungluin
Like a gift, don't step to KRS, you're dismissed!

DUCK! DUCK!
Sucker MC's duck down!
DUCK! BO!
Ree-WINNNNND!!

DUCK! BO!

[AMG]
This is dedicated to the pretty black young women, from AMG...

Fee-fi-fo-fum, I'll spread the jam for the ho-hums
Gimme some baby or maybe
Would you let me smack it up and flip it and run it down, to the bone
Call me when youre momma ain't home
Amg, a 69 king, I lick 'em low
And take my pick like if I had a 'fro
I get a lot of play because I get a lot
And I can get a girly kinda hot when I hit the spot
Supernatural, very irresistible
And if you take a bite, its very nutritional
Its called jiggable pie for the dumb dumbs
You can nibble on it if you want some, my my my

Chorus:
My my my, my jiggable pie(Uh)
My my my, my jiggable pie(Yeah)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(Uh)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(My my my)
My my my, my jiggable pie(Ahh baby)
My my my, my jiggable pie(Uh)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(For you, for you)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie

[AMG]
Crack kills, but not this kind
I try to get ahead when I get behind
I wish I was a pair of panties full grown
So when you put them on, I could be home sweet home
And if you got a weave it dont matter, dump the chitter-chatter
I wanna get it on, you know like give a dog a bone and I'm the K-9
A big black rin-tin-tin with a grin
So let me get a sip of this night train
So we can do the right thing
It be just like redhead, pump it honey
Well let me feel your body, for the jiggable pie

Chorus:
My my my, my jiggable pie(Uh)
My my my, my jiggable pie(Yeah)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(Go back to the bedroom)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(Squeeze the juice)
My my my, my jiggable pie(I got jiggable pies)
My my my, my jiggable pie(All over the nation)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(Station to station)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie

[AMG]
Back to the backs, lets get cheek to cheek
I tend to be a big butt freak
But on this level, I'm a chocalate rebel
Hersheys I might squirt when I insert
Skin to skin, boody I'm all in
And you're all that with your feminine fat
Redbones don't fret I ain't done with you yet
I'm tryin to get all that I can get

Chorus:
My my my, my jiggable pie(Yeah)
My my my, my jiggable pie(So remember)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(It ain't about the color)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(It's about the lover, peace)
My my my, my jiggable pie(East Bay)
My my my, my jiggable pie(Uh)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(Shouts shouts shouts)
Oh how I loves my jiggable pie(Going out to)

[AMG]
My man Maddball
Tony D, he loves the jiggable pie
Trace loves the jiggable pie
K.K. loves the jiggable pie (What about Quik?)
I think D do, do he do he? (What about Quik?)
Hi-C do, don't he don't he? (What about?)

Cut me a slice, uh, ahhh baby, uh, yeah

324,3049,Eric B. & Rakim,Juice (Know The Ledge),25,1992-02-29,"

[Produced by Eric B]

[Verse 1]
Sip the juice, 'cause I got enough to go around
And the thought takes place uptown
I grew up on the sidewalk where I learned street talk
And then talked to all New York
I go to Queens for queens, to get the crew from Brooklyn
Make money in Manhattan and never been tooken
Go Uptown to the Bronx to boogie down
Get strong on the Island, recoup, and lay around
Time to build my juice back up
Props stack up, suckers get smacked up
Don't doubt the clout, you know what I'm about
Knocking niggas off, knocking niggas out
Shaking em up, waking em up
Raking em up, breaking em up
Standing on shaky ground too close to the edge
Let's see if I know the ledge

[Verse 2]
Corner is trifling cause shorty is here
I get cock-D lifting forties of beer
Here's a sip for the crew that's deceased
If I get revenge, then they rest in peace
Somebody's got to suffer, I just might spare one
And give a brother a fair one
Stay alert and on P's
And I do work with these, like Hercules
Switch to southpaw, split your right jaw
Cause I don't like y'all, I'm hype when night fall
Smooth but I move like an army
Bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me
Putting brothers to rest like Elliot Ness
Cause I don't like stress
Streets ain't a place for innocent bystanders to stand
Nothing's gonna stop the plan
I'll chill like Pacino, kill like DeNiro
Black Gambino, die like a hero
Living on shaky ground too close to the edge
Let's see if I know the ledge

[Verse 3]
Shells lay around on the battleground
Dead bodies are found throughout the town
Tried to put shame in my game to make a name
I'ma put it on a bullet, put it in your brain
Rip the block like a buckshot
Who cares where it goes, just keep the casket closed
No remorse when a life is lost
I paid my dues, paid the cost
And my pockets are still fat
Wherever I'm at, I get the welcome mat
Even if my crew asleep and I'm one deep
I attract attention, people like to peep
So come say hi to the bad guy
Don't say goodbye, I don't plan to die
Cause I get loose and I got troops
And crazy juice
In control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini
Hang out with Smith and Wesson, don't try to play me
I'm at war a lot, like Anwar Sadat
But no warning shot, my gun is warm a lot
When I cook beef, the smoke will never clear
Areas in fear but this here's severe
Living life too close to the edge
Hoping that I know the ledge

[Verse 4]
A brand new morn, no time to yawn
Shower's on, power's on
Late for school, I catch the train
Girls sip the style and whisper my name
I push up like an exercise
Check the intellect and inspect the thighs
Select the best one, pull her to the side
Keep her occupied for the rest of the ride
Read her my resume, she's knows already, cool
Just meet me after school
We can moan and groan until your moms come home
And you'll be calling me Al ""Dope"" Capone
Sweatin' me, she didn't want to let me loose
Come get me, that's if you want to sip the juice
Cause the streets await me, so I take my gun off safety
Cause a lot of niggas hate me
Coming out of the building, they set me up
Sprayed with automatics, they wet me up
In a puddle of blood, I lay close to the edge
I guess I didn't know the ledge

1st verse
Hello Helluva!
Hey how you doin'?
It's me the Mac of BHC pursuin' ya
Who in the world gave you the right
To look so well, umm ah, DYNO-MITE?!

Suckin' on a pickle with a Now-a-Later in the middle
How I feel for you girl it's no riddle
I want her

Yeah I got to have her
She looks mo' better so I want her mo' badder
Than a thick man in quick sand- hope for help
At a glance, I'mma go for self

She's as cute as a Puss in Boots
With good hair and it's real to the roots
Damn near perfect all my life I've prayed
For an all world girl who's sweet as Kool-Aid

And thoughts of doin' that onion can make you cry
You're helluva babe
Oh me oh my

Hook
Helluva Helluva!
She's so fine
Helluva Helluva!
Blows my mind
Helluva Helluva!
Lights my need
Helluva Helluva!

She's a helluva girl yeah
The one I want in my life
She's a helluva girl yeah
The one I want in my life

2nd verse
I'm not the kind for nine to five
Cause I rhyme to survive
I guess I do alright
Cause I'm stayin' alive

I'm in the game of fame
Gang of girls want my last name
Not for love but for life in the fast lane
Golddiggers see dollar
So they scream and holler
At my concerts
Hopin' I notice 'em but it don't work

Cause I hate a girl loud as a speaker
Don't get me wrong I also hate salad eaters
Only's been bid to those in the mid
Of the two extremes
Yeah you know what I mean

Love is blind but I see good
I think you're helluva Helluva
Agreed B-Hood? Yeah!!!!
Yeah I knew you'd agree
There's no mistakin' she's B.A.D.!

I court her, support her, escort her and sport her
She's the talk of the town and I'm the reporter
She's Helluva

Hook
Helluva Helluva!
She's so fine

Blows my mind

She's a helluva girl yeah
The one I want in my life

3rd verse
We're still lovey dovey
But it ain't all roses
Cause she's so helluva
And other brothers know this

We can't even go in the mall walkin'
Without brothers hawkin', stalkin' and talkin' that talk
'Bout what they'd do if they were me
But she's locked up and ""if"" ain't the key

(wolf whistle)
I heard a brother whistle
I said ""what up it's time""
I nut up and pull out my pistol

Load the clip and start git git gattin'
What happened?
Shee brothers stopped mackin'

Bend down and tell him it's not cause I'm jealous
Hey just don't disrespect me fella
Now she's mad cause she thinks that I'm violent
The treatment I git is.....
Silent

So yo bro know next time you slip there's a fee
You gotta pay
Hey cause Helluva's wit' me

Hook
Helluva Helluva!
She's so fine
Helluva Helluva!
Blows my mind
Helluva Helluva!
Lights my need

She's a helluva girl yeah

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Well I'm an alley cat, some say a dirty rat
On my side is my gat, see I'm all of that
Spittin' out buck shots, boy I'm gonna wet'cha
Run and hide, but I'm still comin' to get'cha
Thinkin' like a peace smoke, comin' on a homicide
You talkin' shit, tryna take me for a ride
I'm not a bad guy, but I'm the funky feel
Finger on the trigger when my hands up on a steel
Lettin' out a bullet, this is goin' boo-ya
You're stuck in my hood, so what ya gonna do now?
Bein' the hunted one is no fun
Here I come son, yo I think ya better run
Better run more, and move a little faster
Second of thought and I'm comin' to blast ya
With my...

Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Left hand on a forty, [puffin' on a blunt]
Pumped my shotgun, [niggas didn't jump]
Lala la la lala la laaaaa...

[Verse 2: Sen-Dog]
Comin' at you like a stiff blow, fuckin' up your program
Ain't takin' shit from you him or no man
Master mind maniac and a menace, soooo
How they want to pass the sentence
All because a nigga tried to play me on the trigger
He missed, so now the nigga's hist
Rude and crude like a pit bull, get to the point
Your fuckin' card will get pulled, now
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And I'm handin' out beatdowns
I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And I'm handin' out beatdowns [get your face down!]
Put me in chains, try to beat my brains
I can get out, but the grudge remains
When I see ya punk ass, I'm gonna getcha
Get some through ya, shotgun go boo-yaa!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B-Real]
Kickin' that funky Cypress Hill shit
Think I'll light another for the blunted to chill with
Cause I'm the chill one, known to get ill when
They stepped to the Hill ""What's up?"", I had to kill one
Now I'm headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And they got me on lock down
Headed up the river with a boat and no paddle
And they got me on lock down
Livin' like a nigga who done lost his mind
Cause I ain't goin' out like a spineless jellyfish
Some say life is a bitch
Ask that punk who dug his own ditch
Up on the Hill fuckin' up at a party
Tried to get funny, put a hole in his body
Lala la la lala la laaa
Look at all of those funeral cars
Cause I'mma

I'll make ya bump hump wiggle and shake your rump

How high? Real high

A young lovable, hugable type of guy
And everything is to the back with a little slack
Cause inside out, it's wiggida wiggida wiggida wack
I come stompin' with somethin' pumpin' to keep you jumpin

To the back you'll be sportin' the gear; is that coincidental?
Act like you know and don't be claiming that it's mental

[Verse 1]
Act like
Don't call me bitch, punk niggas and all fakers
Weak muthafuckas ain't nothin' but playa haters
Traitors, and all you ever did was hold me down
Slow me down, but everybody knows me now
So what you do is sit and think of a plot
How the hell can we make money off a nigga like 2Pac
This shit dropped and it got me hot
Niggas smiled like a bitch, while I gave you props
I should've saw it as a tip off
But you was riding my dick, a little bit and wouldn't get off
So I couldn't see the real mission
'Cause you smile in my face, and when I leave straight dissin'
What my partner told me
""Yo Pac watch yo back everybody ain't ya homie""
Should a saw you as a front and fake
An envious snake ready to take my fuckin' plate
Some is like a never have a friend like this
I clench my fist and let it end like this
And we can handle it the way we must
But it dust for a nigga that betrays my trust
Don't call me bitch

[Chorus]
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch (call me bitch)
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch

[Verse 2]
Don't call me bitch
You claim to be lady like
You wear your clothes so tight
That you excite the shady type
And at night girl you're the type to get freaky
When I see you in the daytime you're squeaky
Clean, what I mean is ya can't be a fiend for the green
And expect to get treated like a queen
'Cause the brothers on the blocks not havin' it
Let your fat ass pass little scandalous bitch
(talked to the niggas with the biggest bucks
Now ya fucked around and that ass got fucked)
I came equipped with some shit to get ya tipsy
'Cause a bitch is a bitch
She will use any trick to get me
And last year I used to be a saint
Runnin' around sayin' trust a bitch but now I can't
In '92 I'm living heartless
Tryin' to make a million out of 14 tracks so don't start shit
Niggas need to mind they dome
'Cause the time is on for them to find they own
Jock a nigga 'cause he did a major flick
Now you're mad 'cause I won't let you page me bitch
Don't call me bitch

[Chorus]
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch

[Verse 3]
I was got paid, but I remain true to my trade
I worked hard like a slave, to fin to rap to the grave
It's like a rope, I hung it 'cause I knew I was dope
While others giggled and joked
I watched and took notes
Never surrender, that was my motto as I keep strong
Second best for too long, critics I will prove wrong
Or dissin', no one would listen, they was dissin'
My record wouldn't sell they said somethin' was missin'
Claiming I was radical, 'cause I was true to the streets
But did the streets been true to me?
How the fuck would I look if I changed?
Actin' strange 'cause I got a little fame
Ain't that a bitch, I was born in a beat down shack
Ain't no turnin' back and now I'm makin' stacks
And ever since the movie
Hoes want to pop that coochie
Every time it suits me
And still I'm the same
I haven't changed my name
Still pledge allegiance to the game
Pledge my life to the ghetto ways
Do whatever it takes to get paid a day
Refuse to lose, never smoke crack
A mack is a nigga wit' the biggest sack
So baby pick a winner, don't die and swear
As long as that's your hair I'll take you there
But don't call me bitch

[Chorus + 2Pac talking]
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch

[Outro]
Dedicated to the scandalous hoes out there
Don't call me bitch
I be seeing you at the clubs you know tryin to sue a nigga
Don't call me bitch
And to them punk muthafuckas out there (heh)
Don't call me bitch
But I call you big Pac, nigga you playin' me like one so
Yo don't call me bitch
Yeah, and for them muthafuckas that tryin' to get me to sell out, fuck is on they muthafuckin' mind, shit
Don't call me bitch
Yeah, I told you dont call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Don't call me bitch
Yeah, don't call me bitch
This one goes out to my partners in the live squad, ey see y'all?, Black Mafia
Y'all alright you know what I'm sayin'
5 niggas in this motherfucker, you know what I'm sayin'
Digital Underground, ron keys and the whole motherfuckin' stank
Any of ya understand what I mean
Big john motherfuckin' singleton in the house, heartless records in the motherfuckin' house
Watch for a nigga on the big screen and you know what I mean
Don't call me bitch
Watch muthafuckas trip off of this song
But last year he was singing brendas got a baby this year hes sayin' don't call me bitch
Yeah, call me bitch
Some of you niggas are bitches too
Some of you niggas are bitches too
Some of you niggas are bitches too
Yeah, don't call me bitch

[Verse 1: Speech]
Lord I've really been real stressed
Down and out, losing ground
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messin up
Why does it have to be so damn tough
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire (home)
But Lord I ask you (home)
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

[Hook]
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

[Verse Two]
Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talking to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyersburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)
Go back to from whence you came (home)
My family tree my family name (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

Eshe, she went down to Holly Springs
Rasadon and Baba, they went down to Peachtree
Headliner, I challenge you to a game of horseshoes, a game of horseshoes

[Verse 3: Speech]
Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightment of all my folks
He said cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee

[Hook]

[Outro: Aerle Taree]
Headliner, I won the game of horseshoes
Now you owe me a watermelon
Let's go climb trees and skip over rocks
Do like they do below the border
Speech's hair
Don't it look like the roots of the tree that the ancestors were hung from
But that's okay, get it cause he's down to Earth

[Intro - white girls]
Oh, my, god. Becky, look at her butt
It is so big. She looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends
But, y'know, who understands those rap guys?
They only talk to her, because
She looks like a total prostitute, 'kay?
I mean, her butt, is just so big
I can't believe it's just so round, it's like
Out there, I mean - gross. Look!
She's just so ... black!

[Verse 1: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung, wanna pull up tough
Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring
Oh baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (me so horny!)
Ooh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen them dancing
The hell with romancing
She's wet, wet
Got it going like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!

(LA face with a Oakland booty)

[Hook: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
Baby got back!

[Verse 2: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwing a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm acting like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talking about Playboy
Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Begging for a piece of that bubble
So I'm looking at rock videos
Watching these bimbos walking like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get with ya
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *fuck*
Til the break of dawn
Baby got it going on
A lot of simps won't like this song
Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!

[Hook: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
Baby got back!
Yeah, baby ... when it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin'
To do with my selection... 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3""

[Verse 3: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playing workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hon
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that ""hard"" role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' about stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to dis
Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throw down
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

Little in the middle but she got much back!

I should let you know

You got a brother like me the gangster D
I got a nice piece of meat that'll fit you to the tee
So come with me and I'll let you see
Soon as you pull down your panties and I'mma have to eat up some coochie, don't forget about Jay, just want me a fresh ho
If you wanna trip let me know
Ain't got no time for no hootchie games
Just jump out the pipes, don't feel no shame
I love me some hoes, you know I got these young girls
Aiming for this fishing pole
When I stick it to you, girl, you'll be happy
I'mma work it to a sweat, fly you a nappy
That look good, so good and so tight
Come on, girl, let me rip the mic
Cause if you do, I think I just might
You know

[Verse 2]
It ain't the length or the width, it's the way I work it
And like he said, girl, I'm-a jerk, jerk, jerk it
Make you good 'til you curl up your toes
Knock the rollers out your hair 'til they fall on the floor
I was built for war not peace
And what I mean by war means tearing some sheets
And some spreads in the bed
I'll knock your headboards until you clearing stuff out
I'll make you flip, have a fit
While I make you moan and kick
Lookie here, trick, now I'm holding JYB
But you don't need teeth, all you need is strong knees

Come on, lay down
Your butt is nice and round
Now don't interrupt
Because it's time to

[Verse 3]
It ain't nothing but meat on the bone
You can stroke it or choke it or leave it alone
Ain't nothing wrong with group sessions

Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
I'm sweeter and thicker than a chick-o stick
Here's an ice cream cone honey take a lick
Or go to Bay Plaza and catch a flick
Wore my Timberland boots so I can stomp ticks
Scandalous get a whiff of this, miss
Just left the yard boys, now I'm blissed
I feel good per say good state of mind
Drive a red Sterling and the seats recline
I love it when a lady treats me kind
Go to Tavern on the Green and have a glass of wine
He say, she say, I heard it through the grapevine
No static, got an automatic
Too much of anything makes you an addict
Teasin, skeezin, all so pleasin
Don't ask why I got my own reasons
Smooth B, Greg Nice, Slick Nick clique
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick...

[Hook]

[Smooth B]
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 125 and Saint Nick
Waiting on a cab, standing in the rain
Under my heart three clouds of pain
She got the best of me
What was her destiny?
Maybe I should lick her with my nine millime...ter
My mind is in a blur
Cause you could never pay me to think this would occur
Me and this girl Jane Doe was living together
We were inseparable, noone could sever
At least that's what I thought
But later I fought with her substance
And almost ended up in Supreme Court
When I was on the road doing shows getting ends
She was in my Benz getting sniffy with her friends
And even when she crashed my whip I didn't flip
My man Slick Nick said Smooth you're starting to slip
Time went on I started noticing weight loss
Then I had to ask her was she riding the white horse
At first she said no, then she said yo Smooth I'm sorry
But I keep having visions of snow, I need blow
And I said whoa, little hottie
I'm not DeLorean, Gambino or Gotti
I don't deal coke, and furthermore you're making me broke
I'll put you in a rehab and I won't tell your folks
And what do you know
In 18 months she came home and I let her back in
And now she's sniffing again...

[Scarface]
Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die
But some cry, and gets by, while others choose to wonder why..
His life was took at such an early age
A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gauge
He used to hustle on the street corners
His mom would always beg him to quit, but he didn't wanna
As he got older, he got even worse
Til a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse
A cold night in his hood, he had a tangle
The brother he was squabblin with, had broke his ankle
Laid him out in the driveway
Some people knew he wouldn't survive, but hey
I ain't the one to speak up on another's
All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother
He chose the wrong way and that's the route he took
Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook
He had a baby that he couldn't raise
And she will never see her father again, cause he's in a grave
Hey yo, let's think about it, nilla
""My daddy was a dopeman, so I'mma be a dope dealer""
How will the family explain it?
""My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head!""
He ain't around to see her walk
Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she falls
Just the thought of a kid livin fly fucks me up
When his girl has to raise a BASTARD child
It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her
She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater
She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card
Had a kid, now she's realizin life is hard
A big time dope dealer's all she wanted
Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it
The situation's got me guessin..
But the answer remains to be a question
He lived his life in a lie
I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to die

..

[Scarface]
It was crazy how it happened
Some niggas rolled by in the Riviera cappin
All I could see was a pistol spittin rounds
And the boy was just screamin as he fell to the ground
A woman yelled - get an ambulance
But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance
You shoulda seen him, he was scared
A bullet goes to his chest, and one to his head
He just laid there in silence..
And all I heard was the sirens
Paramedics pulled up..
Followed by a law man and then came a firetruck
Put his ass on the stretcher..
But if he survives, I'm willin to betcha
He'll be out for revenge
They patched him up within a week he was back at it again
Went to his brother on the Northside
Grab your shit, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride
Packed it up in the trunk
AK-47, M-11 and a pump
Rolled by ?? on Scott Street
School was lettin out
""Yo you ain't gonna shoot yet?"" ""WATCH ME!""
Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun..
.. he shot him
Put his tooly on the front seat
Continued his mission, as he headed down the street
The kids was just starin at each other
J.D. rolled by and smoked black's brother
Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port
Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch
On his way down Cullard
His brother was just dazed in a shock, ""Why you do it?""
""Why you shot his moms Jay? Shit""
""Hehehehehe.. hah man fuck that bitch""
Went to the store to use the payphone
Called up Mack, ""Aiyyo J.D. homey""
Hung it up and rolled down Dagger
Headin for the nigga he was after
By the time he arrived at the scene
Malcolm was ready for anything
He tried to sneak around the back way
Never thought of bein taken out on that day
Black boy, black coat
Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat
He didn't fall so he fired
One to the middle of his skull, he's expired
A whole army came out
Twenty-seven niggas all strapped out of one house
That how it happens in the acre
One nigga died in the park in the paper
Shit gets deeper but why?
I guess you only get a minute to pray
And a second to die

So what, so what, so what's the scenario

[Verse 1: Phife Dawg]
Heyo, Bo knows this, (What?) and Bo knows that (What?)
But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap
Well what do you know, the Di-Dawg, is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move fakin'
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, NyQuil will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (Yeah!)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back relax and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know

[Verse 2: Charlie Brown]
Yes yes y'all (Yes y'all!)
Who got the vibe, it's the Tribe y'all (Tribe y'all!)
Real live y'all (Live y'all!)
Inside, outside, come around
(Who's that?) Brown!
Some may, I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve rotate the gates
(Contact!) Can I get a hit? (...Hit!)
Boom bip with a brother named Tip and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow?
We're ill 'til the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio, to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me! Yo, what's the scenario?

[Verse 3: Dinco D]
(True blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape crushed grapes apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah-, an -eader, simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see ya later
Later, (Later!), later, alligator
Pop goes the weasel and the herb's the inflater
So yo the D what the O, incorporate I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo, how'd that sound? (Ooh!)

[Verse 4: Q-Tip]
It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (Here!)
Never on the left 'cause my right's my good ear (Ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no (criminal!)
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test, the water, little kid
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell him what I did

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
I heard you rushed and rushed and attacked
Then they rebuked and you had to smack
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear

[Q-Tip]
You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact (Boom!) from the cannon!
Not bragging, try to read my mind, just imagine!
Vo-cab-u-lary's necessary
When digging in the mind library
Oh-my-gosh! Oh my gosh!
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Unh! Unh! Unh! All over the track, man
Unh, pardon me, unh! As I come back
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron
Roar, raow, like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers 'cause your pants were saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (Uh!) the rhymes are on time (Time!)
Ripping up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, mothafucka!

Land of the free but the skin I'm in identifies me
So the people around me energize me
Callin' all aboard this train ride
Talkin' 'bout raw hardcore, leavin' frauds on the outside
But the bad thing is anyone can ride the train
And the reason for that is cause we look the same
Lookin' all around at my so-called friend
Light skin to the brown, the black, here we go again
Homey over there knows Keith and but he be thiefin'
I don't trust him, rather bust 'em up
Out goes his hand and I cough
He once stole from me; yeah, I wanna cut it off
The black thing is a ride I call the nighttrain
It rides the good and the bad, we call the monkey trained
Trained to attack the black it's true
Cause some of them look just like you

[Verse 2]
Stayin' on the scene, sittin' on the train
See all the faces look about the same
There go the sellout who's takin' a ride like Cargo
Cause he deal the keys from Key Largo
Runnin' Nat narcotic, by George he got it
Takin' makin' the G erotic
And the fiends they scheme so he can put 'em down
But his method is wreck 'em, put 'em in tha ground
Got tha nerve as hell to yell brother man
He ain't black man cuz he ate his Pac Man
Known to murder his own, traitor on the phone
Ridin' the train, self-hater trained to sell pain
The master's toy, little boy
Hard to avoid he look wit' it but he null 'n' void
Cause he ridin' the train you think he down for the cause
Cause his face looks just like yours

(CL Smooth)
The conductor, track the structure overstood
Nighttrain the plain, little engine that could
One express so let's next stops Mecca
A place to face to make a black man better
CL and Chuck D, we don't talk rubbage
But just like a slave, we gotta ride wit the luggage
On the nighttrain

[Verse 3]
More of the same insane who sayin' like flowin'
Like nighttrain, runnin' the pain of the black reign
You look, you laugh, you doubt and go out and I'm gone
But the bass goes on
To talk the talk, but walk the walk, the king of New York
Crack a lack attack the black to crack the back
Once again I test a friend with sincerity
Or consider him an enemy
Who am I to tell a lie
Rather push the Bush
Hope da cracker get crushed
I'm rollin' wit Rush
Leader of the bum rush
Russian I ain't spreadin' like paint
Lookin' at the put I got and its kickin'
But it ain't chicken but it's livin' for a city
So sick and tired
Of a scene buckwild, piled in a file
Senile or chile
They said it never been no worser than this
I'm on the nighttrain, they hope ya don't miss it
Give ya what they gotta give you just go
You musn't just put your trust in every brother yo
Some don't give a damn
Cause they the other man
Worse than a bomb
Posin' as Uncle Toms
Disgracin' the race and blowin' up the whole crew
With some of them lookin' just like you

My lifestyle's like suave bola
Keep my hair in a cameo, gettin gas from Amoco
The only thing I'm sniffin is your girlfriend pantyhose
*inhales*  *exhales*  Another hit baby!
And if you find that kinky
Put some barbeque sauce on the tip of my pinky
Watch me get freaky like a nymphomaniac
And exotic, an erotic tour with the mack
No I'm no one to be played with
(Kane: Auditions at 12 baby) for the nightshift

I got you workin on the nightshift
I got you workin on the nightshift

I got you workin on the nightshift

[Big Daddy Kane]
Man, you got to work your women by the scale
I mean if she's skinny, make her bring you home a good penny
And if she fat, make her pay like she weigh
Hmm, come again now

[Positive K]
I'ma quote an old song, that's if I might
What they used to say?  ""The Freaks Come Out at Night.""
Yeah, believe it's true, in fact it's a reality
Some do it for the love and some do it for the salary
Women are true and women are deceiving
Women are also, ladies of the evening
Shakin them hips softly while she's steppin
Her lovin ain't a tool, her lovin is a weapon
Time keeps tickin and the world keeps turnin
Thought I knew it all, but I'm still learnin
So fellas watch your ladies cause it's women I'm pursuin
Takin em away, no matter what you're doin
I don't play games, cause games are for fools
And when your girl picks me - you know the rules!
And when she disappears, don't even wonder if
Cause I'm tellin you now - I got her on the nightshift!

I got her workin on the nightshift
I got em workin on the nightshift

Uhh..
I got em workin on the nightshift
Ah here we go
Uhh, yeah baby c'mon
Uhh, yeah, c'mon
Uhh, a yeah baby c'mon
Check it out
C'mon

[Produced by Pete Rock]

[Intro]
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
I reminisce, I reminisce
Uh! (I reminisce, I reminisce)
Yeah (I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
22 years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast but my granddaddy came sober
Countin' all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose, you hope the little black boy grows, huh
18 years younger than my mama
But I rarely got beatings cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one's a girl, let's name her Pam
Same father as the first but you don't give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won't down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma's gettin married in the house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother Queen's risin a chapter
Déjà vu, tell you what I'm gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Bridge 1: Pete Rock]
My God
It's so
Yeah, so lovely
That's how we like to do it in the 90's
Pete Rock & CL Smooth comin' atcha

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand Poppa Doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother
Taking care of this so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I'm clocking pop's liver
But you can never say that his life is through
5 kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portugese Lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough, they live longer than us
Never been senile, that's where you're wrong
But give the man a taste and he's gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don't wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
I said pop maybe when you're older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing yelling good God, almighty
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real

[Bridge 2: Pete Rock]
For real, baby
Like that
We for real
Comin' atcha
In '92
Pete Rock & CL Smooth
Yeah, c'mon, hit me!

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of wayback, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the R the O-Y, how did you and I meet?
In front of Big Lou's, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes in any weather
My grandmom Pam holds the family together
My Uncle Doc's the greatest better yet the latest
If we're talking about a car, Uncle Sterling got the latest
I strive to be live cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my Aunt Joyce
So Pete Rock hit me, nuff respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen

[Outro: Pete Rock]
Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that's word is bond
I'm not playin
Everybody, just coolin
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another
He was my brother
Trouble T-Roy
It's like that y'all
And you don't stop
Pete Rock and CL Smooth for '92
And we out, later

[Intro x3]
Take it personal

[Verse 1]
I never thought that you would grab me
Undermine me, and backstab me
But I can see clearly now the rain is gone
The pain is gone but what you did was still wrong
There was a few times I needed your support
But you tried to play me like an indoor sport
Like racquetball, tennis, pool, whatever
All I know is that you attempted to be clever
Nevertheless, cleverness can't impress
Cause now you've been exposed like a person undressed
Cause I see through you, because I'm the Guru
Now what you gonna do when I step to you
And when I pay you back I'll be hurting you
And this ain't no threat so take it personal

[Hook x3]
Take it personal

[Verse 2]
Rap is an art you can't own no loops
It's how you hook em up and the rhyme style troop
So don't even think you could say someone bit
Off your weak beat come on you need to quit
I flip lines and rhymes that never sound like yours
There ought to be laws against you yapping your jaws
Originality overflows in the end
The truth is, that you wish you could live the
Life I live and kick the lyrics I kick
But bear in mind that you can't think as quick
So Premier drops beats, for me to say verses to
And if I sound doper then take it personal

[Hook x3]

[Verse 3]
Don't be mad cause I don't come around the way
Like I used to, I don't have time these days
I'm keeping busy making power moves
Don't try to say I don't remember you
You shouldn't let your jealousy show like that
I stopped coming by, cause of the way you act
Telling my business to kids I don't even know
You're like a daytime talk show, and that's low
So you can tell everyone, that I'm jerking you
And if you don't like it kid, take it personal

[Hook x3]

[Hook x4]
La Schmoove, yo we don't got nothing to prove

[Verse 1: Poc Fu]
Yo, when I was small they used to tease me
Because my hair was peasy, hard and greasy
But now I'm living well like George and Wheezy
So easy (WHAT) does it (YO)
Is it because I'm rocking -- beats, beats, beats
Fu-Manchu'n cause I'm doing what just had to be done
Now we in there like swimwear, girls calling me hon
Give me hugs, little peck, mucho tongue, lots of sex
Nuff respects to my bros that live on five-six street (RIGHT)
I'm smashing monster mashing boom bashing in a fashion
Which is wild now I smile when I whip-lash MC's with my style
Call me Cuckoo, I'm making buku bucks
I'm geared and fully prepared to tear all MC's that are schmuks
For bros who sleep and cavity creep and listen when I talk
As I soothe in the groove, cause I'm smooth like Mr. Rourke
Doobely-zoo Mr. Wu, no need to be rude but F.U
Cause I ain't got nothing to prove

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chip Fu]
Leave it to Beaver'-arriva, derci
Heavens to mercy ba FU sayanora
Adios muchachos dorme vous unbuckle my Fu-Schnick shoe
Mr. Chip Fu, about to wreck shop
With the Judo (CHOP) a Judo (CHOP) a Judo chop (CHOP)
Yo zilch kaput me nada none son
I don't think so, so take a look at
A Superfly big Jimmy the Honeynut Cheerio Bee
Ba schnicker bah snchnucker
I ams what I ams that's all what I ams
My lyrics are never done
I'm the big John Elmer Glue the Elmer the Fudd
Al Bundy the Bud Light stud
Come like tongues lashes, with the quickness
Moc and Poc is, my witness
Ask the Kung about my tongue and the styles that I brung instead
I'm the Ali Babi cutty rankin shuba-dib-da-dabble
Jaw Boy Wonder Bread dread, BUM BA READ
These lyrics ah-come out of mi head, BUM BA READ
Mr. Chip Fu's gon stay' di-di, da-di-di, dra-dread
You said I couldn't rap, but I really wrecked shop
And I don't stop drop, I get props
I pick up the mic drop a style and pattern and fashion
And all MC's jaws drops down
My accent, you're mocking my clothes, you're clocking
Ripping MC's to smithereens to their
Ribbidy-diddiby-Pippi Long-STOCKINGS
So don't step to Chip, I'm on the La Schmoove tip
You'll say Drats I really failed again plus he sank my Babble-ship
So oooh, shit G, wa-wa or biscuit
Rip it and be specific doin it terrific when I kicks it
Chitty-Chitty Bang-Bang, Pepe LePew, Pepe LePew
La Schmoove, yo I ain't got nothing to prove

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Phife Dawg]
Now here I go, once again with the ill flow
Other MC's that rap, their style is so-so
Phife Dawg was never the type that ever lacked skills
I just stay true to my roots and then I get ill
Twenty years of age but yet I still see (KNOWLEDGE)
And this year, was so-called, my Senior year in (COLLEGE)
But I chose to pursue, in a field called music
And with some hype beats and breaks you know I won't refuse it
Get on the board lay down the track and I'll do ten laps
Pass the pen, pass the pad, and I'll kick nuff (RAPS)
Just come inside your jam and witness who is boss
And it won't be Tony Danza nor Diana Ross
As small as I am, I still can pack jams
Do a freestyle and step, but yet I still slam
Not trying to say that no one can get with me
Not only is it the lyrics I write, it's my delivery
Name one rapper that you know who has this high-strung voice
My name's Malik and I'm unique, in other words top choice
Nothing commercial bout this, it's mainly hardcore
Now that you got what you want, do you want more
Because I got more in store

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Moc Fu]
MC, the Shining One, a.k.a. The Golden Child
I have a grin at times but then throw up a fake smile
Vaseline Intensive Care, don't fear mon frere
Sak Pase, everybody that rappin, G pull his hair
Back in the groove, it's no way you can handle this
Shit so fly, that you can call it scandalous
Cause I mani-fest in, words that I'm preaching
Unleashing you now seek the sounds that I'm teaching
I hear (NOT) see (NOT), knots to makes butts (ROCK)
I rides rhythm to the beginnin, then won't stop
The Chinese Son of Sam, the Skipper's Peter Pan
The rootinest tootinest cowboy in the East
Releasing a new type of lyrical lingo
Single, +The Alarm+, the girls cooties I will tingle
No expiration date, so you know I won't (EXPIRE)
No skippin a weekly check, so I don't have to (RETIRE)
Write, the ca-pital, M.O
Chip Fu with the Kung-Fu givin shouts on my show
Ir-regular styles is here too
Tripped, boo-boo, you first made a mistake
Not Alexander but considered to be Great
Great, but, like the Grape Ape
Fake, the moves, and your ankles I will break
Break, or broken, the M.O., has spoken
Movements on the slick, taking the train you need a token
I guess not, cause you pause for the cause
You either biting your nails, or start picking straws
Holy Mick I'm living large just like trunk jewels
Nuff respects to many minds, Ah-OWWWWWWWWWWWEE

[Verse 1]
I skipped the line, I paid my dime
I hung my coat, and now it's time
To move to the forefront make my rounds
Say peace and give a pound have a drink, get down
I'm on the floor, besides the door
The sound is rich, and I ain't poor
I'm looking for Susie or Wendy or Judy
But look at her (but look at her)
But look at her
(Who me?)
Yes, you sweetie, although it's hard to see thee
I see your silhouette and what I see has got me needy
I need you for a second of your time
But then I reckon that a second is too short let me try
(You're slamming!)
But anyway, I'd like to say
I'm Dres of the Black Sheep givin' you play
Step out in the light, come show off yourself
Yo, I'm sorry, I thought you were someone else

[Chorus]
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
Just don't know ""Why?"" Hon, I just don't know
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
See something ain't right ""Why?"" It's the strobe light

[Interlude]
[Mista Lawnge]
Van Damme, Oh man, now you look out
I can not dig it, I can not dig it
No, Black yo, I can not dig it

[Dres, Strobelite Ho]
Listen Hon, I mean aaaaaah
It was nice looking at you, I just have to go
My man is right over there
(Where you going?)
I have to go my - Huh?
I'm on my way Black, I'm on my -
(Don't you have a number or something?)
Listen it's uh, seven six five, four three two one
(Wh-what area code is that?)
One, nine-hundred

[Verse 2]
Listen here dear, step to the rear
Find yourself a seat, buy yourself a beer
Eat some pretzels, go play some videos
Thank you for your time honey but ho I gotta go
I think I lost my coat, and plus I'm double parked
I thought you was my girl, you see I can't see in the dark
Anyway I'm out, out is what I be
I've got to step
(With the viscosity)
When you see a honey by the strobe light
Black I hope you got good sight
For honey that you see, like a Shakespeare soliloquy
May or may not be, all that
In fact, quite wack
With the girl that makes you stop tracks
But neither here nor there fear
Unless, of course, you don't care
Listen baby girl, let me say it slow
I-have-to-go
Not to dis, but let's disperse
Yo, I'll see you later, unless I see you first

[Chorus]
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
Just don't know ""Why?"" Hon, I just don't know
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go (Don't go)
See something ain't right ""Why?"" It's the strobe light

[Outro]
Can't swing tonight, so ahhhhhhh
Honey take a hike, go fly a kite
And I don't mean to be um impolite
But yo, I'm outta here aight?

[Prince Poetry]
The sun reflects off of the waves at sea
Rain support roots that implants the tree
There's a breeze - in the park, kites fly high
Under the branches, convertibles fly by
The sky..

[Pharoahe Monch]
..blue, fields green
Paints a picture that creates a scene
Of the destiny that controls my fate
Reflections of light, creates shapes

[Prince Poetry]
Inside of this particular sphere, I see kids in the street
When I pass, I go Beep! Beep! Beep!

[Pharoahe Monch]
See the black boy over there runnin scared
His old man runs numbers summers
Come in and he'll feel dumb if his son
Doesn't have a new pair of sneakers
So he combinates people's numbers in sequence
When play straight, but not in the leaders

[Organized Konfusion]
Hip-Hop pumps inside of Jeeps and cars
It's daytime but we still peep stars
Parties every night, we gotta move, we gotta go
We gotta step, let's, jet!

[Hook]
We gotta get away, we gotta do it now
We gotta walk into the sun! Ha hah
We gotta get away, we gotta do it now
We gotta walk into the sun!
We gotta get away, we gotta do it now
We gotta walk into the sun! Ha hah
We gotta get away, we gotta do it now
We gotta walk.. in..to.. the.. sun..

[Pharoahe Monch]
Love and hate, black and white
Right or wrong, who is right?
Some smoke joints to anoint their brain
To the vanishing point, so they won't go insane

[Prince Poetry]
Mother may I? Yes you may
Take two giant steps to go out and play
I got next, sorry Duke, I got my five
You better call next and step to the side

[Pharoahe Monch]
There's no specific topic of speech in this rhyme
I just wanna go on a ride
On a kaleidoscopic tree, visually..

[Prince Poetry]
..individually, we go our separate ways
To get our haircuts and moustaches trimmed
Rockin a t-shirt, shorts with thick socks
With my boots that I nickname Timber
Here comes they fall
I can remember when we used to chill and hang
With Paul, Sea..

[Hook]

[Pharoahe Monch]
Sittin on a stoop, while the Johnny-pump shoots
Water while we eat fruits
The radio pumps, rockin to L.O.N.S. and yes
The girls display flesh by the way they dress

[Prince Poetry]
The Ave surprises, the fulfilling collage
Of scratches that strike like sticky matches
Attacking techniques with combinating
Constantly motivating highly elevating the light steps

[Pharoahe Monch]
When the air gets thick and you can feel the tension
I bypass Howard and detour Benson
Cause I don't really feel like fencing today
So I chill in my own dimension and listen to the sax blow
Flow, abstract the sax always seems to relax you
But at the same time, it attacks you
In this particular era of darkness
Bust a rhyme that might enlighten the mind and spark this
Trail to follow the light that's guiding you from
The evil that you walk into the Sun
From what I see it's an addiction
I'll explain to the brain about pain affliction
Grab my hand, hold it tightly
Close your eyes and maybe you might see what I see
Yo, what I said simplistic
But what I see's not materialistic

[Prince Poetry]
My hay fever is acting up
So I took a couple of antihistamines (whew!) I got struck
With relief, now patiently I wait for the summer
Cause the spring brings pollen and that can be a bummer
A terrific brother was havin a specific get-together by the beach
Rolling Rock's, plus Peach Schnapps, served on the rocks
The Organisms play the boardwalk, pullin numbers from Pros' Peak
The scenario, where we go pumpin the Alpine stereo
Hop along the turnpike on our way to the merry-go
-round up the herbs at six flags; we're on a mission
Hittin the streets of New York in zig-zags
Walkin to the park, hark, the herald, named Erald
Who creates with charts
Central Park swarms with intellectual dialects
With the potential, of the city's best emergency medical techs
So I dip dip dive
Listen to the musicians in the park play live
The Funky Drummer was drumming even though he was a bum
Some couldn't comprehend, the vibe that blended
With the sum, there were some, who wasn't dumb
I supported with the hum, dropped five bucks, cause he was the one
Yo, I gave a clap, I gave a wink, I gave a shout
I gotta meet the Monch, STRIKE THREE and I was out!

"
363,3449,Tim Dog,Bronx Nigga,25,1992-06-20,"

Rollin' around with my 10-man crew
Lookin' for a nigga that they call Boo
He's a stick-up kid living on the block
Stickin' up niggas out after dark
He was fucking with my little brother the other night
My brother said the punk cold took his bike
I was mad and I was gettin' upset
Got two clips with my nine and then jet
And you can guess what I'm gonna do
While I'm ridin' 'round with my crew
I'mma blast that nigga, I'mma shoot that nigga
I'mma smoke that nigga, I'mma do that nigga
Yeah, cause I want niggas to know that I'm Dog
And I'm runnin' the show
Just then my man said ""Look""
""There goes the nigga, there goes the crook""

[Dialogue]
Shhh - be quiet man. Pull over...
Yeah, I'mma show this nigga what time it is
Yeah, let me get out...
Ayyo Boo, ayyo Boo, come here man, come here
(Boo) Yeah, what's up? What's up?
Ayyo, check this out here...

To hell with you! I'm a Bronx nigga

I'm a Bronx nigga, I'm a Bronx nigga (x3)

[Verse 2]
Standin' on the Ave., One-Six-Nine
Bitches lookin' dope and I'm going for mine
There's a girl named Lisa lookin' kind of fly
She walked by and cold winked her eye
Awww shit, the bitch is on my dick
That's the piece of ass that I've got to hit
So I make my move, start to kick game
She had the nerve to ask me my name
""I'm the Dog, the largest motherfucker in my block
""Get in my car and let's hit the spot
""What's the spot? The spot that's my cribbo
""My place, my pad, bitch you know
""It's the place where I put my head to rest
""Just get in my ride and I'll tell you the rest""
We was out and I was doin' 95
Got to the crib in ten minutes time
Poured her a nice cold drink
Whispered in her ear and said ""I know what you think""
She said ""What?
I said ""I think you're all that""
""How can you tell?""
""Because your ass is phat""
She said ""What? I know you're not tryin' to diss""
""Naw, I'm just playin'. Yo, give me a kiss""
I was tonging the bitch down and finger-poppin'
Next thing you know, her panties start droppin'
I was dickin' her, dickin' her, dickin' her well
Dickin' her, dickin' her, dickin' her well
Dickin' her, dickin' her, dickin' her well...
Until the bitch started to yell
I got up, washed my dick and got dressed
She said ""Dog you know you fuck the best""
I said ""Put on your shit, let's break out
""This ain't no motherfuckin' stake-out""
We was out, dropped the bitch at the train
Threw her a token, said ""Forget my name""
She got upset and called me a ""bum nigga""
I said, ""No baby, huh, I'm a Bronx nigga""

[Hook]
I'm a Bronx nigga, I'm a Bronx nigga (x3)

[Verse 3]
I'm a Black man tryin' to make an honest buck
But Five-O don't give a fuck
Pullin' me over at every single light
Hawking me every night
But there's this one night when the Five-O rolled up
Pulled me over and said ""Enough is enough""

(POLICE OFFICER) ""Hey, let me see your driver's license and your registration right now, BOY!""
Yo, why it gotta be all that? What did I do?
I didn't do nothin', man. Why you fuckin' with me?
(POLICE OFFICER) ""Don't give me any of that smart talk nigga, or I'll haul your ass down to jail right now.""
Aiight, I got somethin' for you...
(Automatic gunfire)

Smoked his ass, that's why I'm livin'
Later on that night, the news:

(TV reporter) ""Black youth kills police officer in the Bronx. Details at 11.""

See that shit? It's already on TV
But if it was me, you would have never seen that shit get live on the air
The motherfuckers don't care
That's why I live by the trigger
You know why...cause I'm a Bronx nigga

I'm a Bronx nigga, I'm a Bronx nigga (x3)

The miggida miggida miggida Mac came to get 'em warm
And my pants to the back, that's my everyday uniform
You little cream puff Mac Daddy wannabe
Keep dreaming 'cause a Mac you will never be
So all y'all with the Dr. Seuss riddles
You can get the finger... the middle

[Hook 2X]

Ay, yo Kris, kick it

[Verse 2: Daddy Mac]
I caught you on the scope (the scope)
Peepin' out my rhymes that's this dope (it's dope)
And for you there's no hope
My name (is what?) Daddy Mac, baby
Totally Krossed Out catching all the ladies
The age I be I should be playing with toys
Instead I put my head into making you make noise
That's how I kick it, that's my everyday life and
I rehearse to keep it sharp as a knife, man
I'm the wrong brother for suckers to be messing with
'Cause when I put the mic in my hand I start wrecking it
They call me the D-A-double D-Y-M-A-C
And there ain't another brother bad as me
When I (let go) something from the (ghetto), word
A little brother kicking rhymes like you never ever heard
Daddy of them all, shooting the gift like a gun
Showing suckers how it's done

[Hook 2X]

Yeah, now you all know
What's up?
And the Mac's all that
Yeah...we gonna kick one more verse for y'all

[Verse 3]
[Mac Daddy]
So many times I heard you rhyme but you can't touch this
I'm kicking the type of flow that makes you say, ""You're too much, Kris""
So feel the fire of the one they call the Mac Dad
The fire's what I pack and what I pack is real bad
I'd like to grab ahold of your soul and never let go
Do the jump, do the Hump and say ""Ho!""
Now that's the state of mind I'm in, huh...
With rhyme after rhyme I win

[Daddy Mac]
I'm the wrong brother for suckers to be messing with
'Cause when I put the mic in my hand I start wrecking it
They call me the D-A-double D-Y-M-A-C
And there ain't another brother bad as me
When I (let go) something from the (ghetto), word
A little brother kicking rhymes like you never ever heard
Daddy of them all, shooting the gift like a gun
Kris Kross show 'em how it's done

Warm it up, Kris (repeat until end)

How to survive in South Central
Rule number one: Don't fuck with a nigga in a Benz-o
It's '92 and shit is getting hectic
So if you get naked stay protected (Yep)
And keep an open eye, for people smoking [?]
Cause that's when you slip and you trip and ah...
Once I knew this girl who dressed like a hooker
'Til some niggers five-deep in the Jeep came and took her
[?]
Don't blink if you wear a [?]
Take it from a sister who knows the street life
Bo knows sports, I take no shorts
A woman gotta do what a woman gotta do
Make one move and they'll gat you
In the back—with a gat
The homegirl don't play that
(Yeah)

(The homegirl don't play that)
Rule number two: get yourself a crew
Cause Yo-Yo rolls with the I.B.W
Mama said never take candy from a stranger
Nine times out of ten they put you in danger
So don't let 'em, if you just met 'em
And he's tryin' to be a pimp and drive a Nissan Sentra
Talkin' that talk, [?]
Fuck it, don't trust 'em, from the biggest to the smallest
Cause chances are he's [?] than a smoker
So don't let a fool [?] cause he smile
His faces come in all different sizes and shapes
A .38 works much better than some mace
Full form [?] so keep it in [?]
Cause only some hoochies let him pop that coochie
Now he's got the most maniacs on the meth
That's why I stay strapped, homegirl don't play that
(Yeah)
(The homegirl don't play that, trick) x4
(Break 'em off)
Don't do it x4

Break it down to the nitty-gritty; the city's shitty (Yep)
A place where they show no pity (Uh!)
Some just won't take no for an answer
[?] disappear faster than [?]
[?] with the purse, you're running like [Hershell?]
Walkin' down the block, you yellin' ""Stop!
Somebody call the police, he stole my diamonds and my pearls
A tall dark guy with a curl"" Uh
Next-door neighbors, nice people
But they don't want no beef, so they see no evil
Hear no evil. You better go tell a friend
Cause you'll probably never see your Liz Claiborne again
It's off to the slums, the winos and the bums
Dial 9-1-1, wait-wait-wait 'til they come
So if you try to play me out like a toy
You gotta deal with three hundred and fifty-seven homeboys

Don't do it

I keep in shape and do my physical fitness
Your head's numb, so your brains a miss this
Pick 'em up, eat 'em up, pick 'em up, heat 'em up
Pick 'em up picklehead, pick 'em up picky
I roll wit globs and I come real sticky
Grippin' the mic, I plug it up in your ears
Crazed and brewer. I'm coming out like beers
Like Rheingold, Miller, Coors, and Buds
I'm a eat 'em wit popcorn and treat 'em like suds you duds
Coming out the wick wack, wicky, wickable wack
Black jack, that's a fact, writing exact behind your back
The funk rhyme'n master, blaster
Kicking up in a brainstorm, rainstorm
Rap storm, rap form
Rap time, rap rhyme
Rap class, I'm here to fail and to pass
To continue, furthermore on the hype tip
I roll and rock, rock and roll
Jazz and pop, rhythm and Blues
Dance and fusion, brain confusion
Look at the lights, what a night on the town

[Hook]
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast (4x)

[Verse 2: Kool Keith]
Now I'm back to funk, freak the funk
Hype the funk, swipe the funk and all that junk
I get busy on 'em, communicate wit the world
Man, woman, a baby boy and a girl
Poppa large looking out, the bombs drop
Taking stroud while your face and arms drop
Stop, look, learn to read, learn to write
Learn to talk, learn to walk
And watch your step though, I'm hype and ripe though
Kleptomaniac, a rhyme'n psycho
A Ricky Ricardo, a Guy Lombardo
Sporting a ragtop, an El Dorado
Step into Hollywood, I'm screening the boulevards
The rhymes is gain type, I'm ready to pull a card
Jack'a Ace, King'a Queen
Call me the deuce, I'm pouring out like juice
Hitting the top, feeling the rim
Getting a trim, I never rhyme like them
On and on, on and on, on and on
Until the break of dawn
I go overtime, rock the mic in nighttime
Daytime, switching off to Primetime
Pacific east, strolling back in the west time
Ride the funk wit the mic in the east rhyme
Hype and dope, hype the frame
The mic is smoking, yo I ain't joking
Rhyme to kill, rhyme to murder, rhyme to stomp
Rhyme to ill, rhyme to rock
Rhyme to smack, rhyme to shock, rhyme to roll
Rhyme to destroy any decoy boy
On the microphone

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You're dripping sweaty, coming hard on your neck
As I flow and grow from head to toe
Seeking a style like John McEnroe
Dissing 'em all, serving them wit the mic stand
Like Prince and Michael coming out wit a big band
The crowd is live, you can play as the manager
Run wit the money, I pull the trigger and damage ya
Boom, taking life more serious
I may sound lyrical and very mysterious
Rhymes are grip tight, program to kill more
A son of Sam, how could I be Gilmore?
Grabbing the mic, you see the dark and shadows
You're in living hell, without time to battle
The funk ignited, hands are writing, brains dividing
I'm coming out in sighting
Like I'm Blackula, a better man that Dracula
Spectacular and not irregular
In fact you are speaking impopular
Rhymes are moved and you can't be stop wit the
Beat as it goes to the rhyme that flows
Like a coke in a straw burning up in your nose
That's a bad habit, stepping out on stage one
Drop the mic, come and turn to page one
Look at the master, my rank is higher
My lyrical burns, your brain's on fire

[Hook]
Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique

[Verse 1]
Let's trace the hits and check the file
Let see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass to MC's get weak
For every word they trace it's a scar they keep
Cause when I speak, they freak to sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
With a melody and a President's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits with beats
Parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MC's wanna beef then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique

[Hook]
Don't sweat the technique

[Verse 2]
They wanna know how many rhymes have I ripped and wrecked
But researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces are took to labs to observe them
They couldn't absorb them, they didn't deserve them
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens are swords
Letters put together from a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, formed with structure
Because of my culture, I'm equipped to construct the
Technical styles that'll be full of technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak just seek
And peep the technique

[Hook]
Never sweat the technique

[Verse 3]
I speak indiscreet cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep in the beat then complete the
Poem's physique, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old, techniques become antiques
Better then something brand new cause it's real
And in a while the style’ll have much more value
Classical, too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never irrelevant, mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs for all the years
You fought and sought, the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique

[Hook]
Never sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique
Don't sweat the technique

[Introduction: Large Professor]
Now I've never been one to knock the next man for getting his
You know what
I'm saying? (Right, right)
And I do realize that now hip-hop is a form of
Showbiz (Uh huh)
But this has always been something with which you have to be
True
So in the year on 1992...(this is how we do!)

[Verse 1: Large Professor]
At the age of 19, heard the scene
A lot of M.C.'s that do not come clean
Fronting on dealing hard times in rhymes
You see him in the streets and you see no signs
Of the hell, and they get on stage and tell
Some cornball war story, ring the bell (word)
You're fakin' the funk
Talking that extra hard junk, you're probably a punk
And I'mma let you know, that this way
You just don't cut with the artificial flow

[Verse 2: Neek the Exotic]
Neek the Exotic breaks backs and necks
When fakes try to front, they get smoked like blunts
My rhymes penetrate like skunk
Ayo word up, I think you're fakin' the funk

[Large Professor]
You're fakin' the funk! (You're fakin' the funk)

[Hook:]
Yo! You're fakin' the funk! (You're fakin' the funk) [x6]

[Verse 3: Large Professor]
You do a song about a current event
Get on television and seem hesitant to represent
And that's what we call fraud
You can't kick the streets with a ""Look, I sold out"" award (word)
And everywhere has streets
That's not trying to hear the same wack rhymes
Over the same stink beats
Cause times are real, and I can't feel
Putting...down on the reel to reel

[Verse 4: Neek the Exotic]
Now I'm a let you know
With those weak style of raps, it's time to go
I eject rejects that step
I'm a vet ready to snap your neck
I shine and rhyme at the same time
The mastermind of the sport called the rhyme
Now it's my time to dump chumps that front
(Ayo Professor what's up?)

[Large Professor]
You're fakin' the funk

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Large Professor]
The era of the wack M.C
Is getting shut down when the Main Source stomps through your town
Cause we don't play the role of a clown
And keep things jumping with the real rap sound

[Verse 6: Large Professor and Neek the Exotic]
So to all the people stealing beats (You're fakin' the funk)
To the crossover rapper with the pleats (You're fakin' the funk)
To all the chumps that's claiming the streets (You're fakin' the funk)
Fronting incredible feats (You're fakin' the funk)
To the girl acting like a prostitute (You're fakin' the funk)
Wearing that hooker type suit (You're fakin' the funk)
To the rapper with the big space suit (You're fakin' the funk)
To the artist that doesn't pay dues (You're fakin' the funk)

[Verse 7: Neek the Exotic]
Cause, exotic and then you're torn with the hyper tone
I can't be blown because my rhymes are hard like stone
So prepare for the scare, because I'm you're worst nightmare, punk
Cause you're fakin' the

Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin
I came to win, battle me that's a sin
I won't ever slack up, punk you better back up
Try and play the role and yo the whole crew'll act up
Get up, stand up (c'mon!) c'mon throw your hands up
If you've got the feeling, jump up, touch the ceiling
Muggs lets the funk flow, someone's talking junk
Yo I bust him in the eye, and then I'll take the punk's ho
Feelin, funkin, amps in the trunk and I got more rhymes
Than there's cops at a Dunkin' Donuts shop
Sho' nuff, I got props
From the kids on the Hill plus my mom and my pops
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

I'll serve your ass like John McEnroe
If your girl steps up, I'm smacking the ho
Word to your moms, I came to drop bombs
I got more rhymes than the Bible's got Psalms
And just like the Prodigal Son I've returned
Anyone stepping to me you'll get burned
Cause I got lyrics, but you ain't got none
If you come to battle bring a shotgun!
But if you do you're a fool, cause I duel, to the death
Trying to step to me, you'll take your last breath
I got the skills, come get your fill
Cause when I shoot the gift, I shoot to kill
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
Jump!

[Verse 3: Everlast]
I'm the cream of the crop, I rise to the top
I never eat a pig, cause a pig is a cop
Or better yet a Terminator, like Arnold Schwarzanegger
Try to play me out like, as if my name was Sega
But I ain't going out like no punk bitch
Get used to one style and yo and I might switch
It up up and around, then buck buck you down
Put out your head and then you wake up in the Dawn of the Dead
I'm coming to get ya, I'm coming to get ya
Spitting out lyrics, homie I'll wet ya
I came to get down, I came to get down
So get out your seat and jump around!

[Verse 1:]
You think Oakland California is a city of punks
It only takes a second, to pop the trunk
And just like that you know it's real
You're in the right damn town to get killed
It's all about the game, and nothin else
You come out here, you better watch yourself
Cause you can wear what you want, even blue or red
But cross the wrong brothers, and end up dead
You catch a body full of bullets, and get blasted
Tryin to be a gangsta but you just ain't lastin
This little town is gettin wild as hell
Check the penetentiaries and all the jails
If they could lock us all up that would be just fine
Got my partners from Oakland doin serious time
You can't argue with the truth it's hard to be black
But it's a mindgame, and you gotta deal with that
I wake up everyday and I just can't wait
To make mo money, cause back in the days
When I rapped, I did the same damn thing I do now
Grab the microphone, and show you how
But I was broke, the only thing I had was game
I started makin money and knew things would change
Bought a Benz, thought it might earn respect
But the OPD, found it hard to accept
I got jacked by the Task and jacked by the Vice
Face down on the ground keep my hands in sight
Put the handcuffs on backseat I'm in it
Illegal search for about thirty minutes
Askin me, where's the dope
Where's my gun, but I don't know
I said I'm rappin, they laugh like I told a joke
And to this day they think I'm sellin coke

[Hook:]
I want to be free! (and that's the truth) Ohhh yeahhh
I want to be free! Ohhh yeahhh

[Verse 2:]
I be in Oakland California every day of my life
Bass so hard you think I'm smokin a pipe
And if I don't smoke it, I gots to grind
Searched all my stuff, and all you find
Is a pocket full of money count seven G's
Now you wanna think I'm sellin keys
Cause I'm a black man, but I run my own business
So why the police wanna send me to prison
They see a brother makin major cash
They knock a patch out his black ass
And that's the truth, you can't argue you at all
Tryin to give you ten years for a phone call
Ain't even trippin on the dank smoke
Cause all they wanna find, is guns and coke
In court all the time tryin to fight it
We get rich, we get indeibted
So what's the problem Officer this time?
Is havin' big money being black a crime?
Or did you take me to jail, to teach me a lesson
Charge me with somethin, or just ask questions
About the brothers I hang around
What's really goin on in the Oakland town
Tell me who went broke, and who got rich
But Too $hort baby just ain't no snitch
You say you're just doin your job
But you're gettin on my nerves, just like Bob
Everytime I hit a corner, I see you
Always tellin brothers what to do
You lock me up cause I don't know how to act
But I'm down for mine so I be talkin back
And when I do, you treat me bad as hell
I'm sick of spendin nights in jail

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Got out of jail about fo'-fifteen
Walkin down the street like a broke dopefiend
Had a pocket full of money tryin to play the role
Benz got towed and I was hella cold
But I ain't trippin, I'm gettin used to it now
Handcuffed your boy took me straight downtown
For three warrants, had to catch me sooner or later
Cause the five-oh's always tryin to jack a playa
For no reason, wasn't doin nothin wrong
You think I'm lyin, singin that same ol song
Well I'm a black man, ridin in a Benz
How in the hell did I make these ends? Here we go
I pull over to the right
Stop the engine keep my hands in sight
I start cursin, cause it don't make sense
Why would I run and try to jump a fence
If I was plannin, a smooth getaway
I never woulda stopped in the first place
You'd be high speed chasin me but this time you ain't
Cause all I got on me is a big fat bank
And I hope I don't get robbed by you know who
Make me donate some G's to the boys in blue
And if I sue, I won't get nothin back
But I ain't mad... I'm just black...

Dank in hand, the shit that has you tore down
A little city, chillin in the North Bay
Needless to say, my boys don't play, fool
Yorker sidin', you know how the song goes
In the back, sippin Purple Chongos
Don't look for trouble but it always seems to find us
Forty grippin', panty sippin', and it sneaks up right behind us
Quick left, one blow K.O
Hit the road to the next episode
In the saga of a few fellas
Oh what the hell, I guess I better tell ya
It's Friday night, I got a brand new kit on
A fifth of Heem, for me to get bent on
Hit the Country Club to pick up M-L
Eighty West, back to the hotel

At the telly, Vogues is doing pipe work
Johnny Z had his hand up a miniskirt
The latte in the corner started to flirt
And I knew that when she saw me baby doll was gonna jaw me
Set for the night so I took her to my ride
Grab my Mickey and my Buddha and I met her outside
Who-ride, rolling striking through to be seen
A Lexus 400 turnin' triple gold Zeens
Acid in my bottle, so I gotta get some more
Put the pedal to the metal back to the liquor store
Cause you know what I mean when I'm feelin kinda funky
A sick honky, straight goin donkey
Money in my sock, jimmy in the glove
Layin in the Lexus, I'm about to make good love
And burn rubber up the block
Back to the telly, I gotta get some new cock
New cock (echoes)

Aw naw, could it be?
I just got a page an' a broad wanna do me
Hooked it up, told her meet me at the hotel
She had a friend with her so I called TL
Swoop me up, Sally wanna meet Dick
And might lick, so try an' make it real quick

Two tall cans and a packet of Blackjacks
We got the goods, now we're headin for the hoedown
There goes the telly, so fella won't you slow down
Park the ride in the front like a sick one
Just in case, we gotta bust a quick one
Lock the load, let's go look for like 118
But lay low cause I really don't wanna be seen
(Is this the room?) Aw yeah, that's the right one
I got the black broad and you got the white one

Try an' throw this thing all night an'
Get her so sprung, that she'll drop some mail

Welcome to the ghetto

(Verse 1)
Livin day by day in my hood on the spot
See the same old things:same dope
Fiends cops
Just an average day in the streets of California
5-0 find a young girl dead around the corner
Mommies on her knees she had tears in her eyes
And nobody knew why the young girl had to die
People look ashamed it's been like this fo years
Bloody sheets on her body face wet from her mama's tears
She couldn'ta been over 4-5
And if mommy wasn't based she would still be alive
But now the street is a place you could be swallowed by death
Brothas takin each other's lives
And goin to REST IN PEACE
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
My cousin died last year
And I still can't let go
I walk the streets of my city of my neighborhood
Seein dope fiends livin off can goods
15 niggas on the corner
And niggas die young in California
5-0 'll get a dope case and flaunt it
Have your ass on ""America's Most Wanted""
But I don't slang or even gang-bang
And though my old school homies do the same thang
I still got love cause you gotta live
So you can give
And raise a family G
But you gotta do your best slangin D-O-P-E
So keep a grip on yourself and stay mellow
And welcome to the ghetto
(Make me Wanna Holler, they way they do my life)

(chorus) 4x
Welcome to the ghetto
(Make me Wanna Holler, they way they do my life)

(Verse 2)
From across the seas comes cocaine
But you never seen a black man fly the plane
Look at the news:a young black death
Was it drug related,take a guess
I flash when I look in the mirror black
Cause my reflection is a 9 millimeter Gat
I think about genocide
And have thoughts of my homies who died
Everybody backstabbin
But I ain't the one to talk I'm into gafflin
Death
Gives a shit about your color
But yet I see mo dead young brothas
I'm goin crazy out here
Seein 24 brothas die by the end of the year
And I still gotta deal with the 5-0
And I stopped sellin dope in 9-0
But if I came to it
I probably still do it
Put a Nine in my draws get straight to it
I hope that I never see the day
That I get 20 years for a cake
B-K-A as a key
So open up the door for the
Mo money
But I ain't gotta do that G
Cause I'm down with the F-A to the C to the U to the L-T-Y
G-nut X-tra Large
And S-P-I-C-E make niggas feel like jello
And welcome to the ghetto
(Make me Wanna Holler, they way they do my life)

Welcome to the ghetto 7x

(Verse 3)
Ain't no justice its just us
And any nigga with the guts loves to bust
At the police niggas can't get peace
Sendin' troops to the ghetto like the middle east
My homie on the block got beat down
And he never sold an ouce, a key, a pound
Suicide was a notion, sometimes I wanna run and dive in the ocean
But killin' myself ain't the answer cause the problems of the world need a cure like cancer
And everybody see the problem but the president and he ain't livin' in the ghetto so that's evident
I quit pullin' over, fuck the police
Cause they beat Rodney King like a savage beast
Now motherfuckers on my block think its Glock time
Open up season on cop time
So welcome to the ghetto
Where niggas try to play yo ass like a cello
The mayor got the projects boarded up
And the white and the blacks all sorted up
My people livin' in poverty
And everytime i wanna' max I'm on a motherfuckers property

(Check it out, y'all) (Repeat 2X)

[Verse 1]
Chi-Ali the lady stunner, I'm stunning the stunts
That's blowing me kisses because I'm a Native Tonguer
The native runner, and I'm about to blaze this flock track
Like Isaac, I leave ya in the Hayes
For days and days and days you try and phase
Yet you need to get Met, 'cause yo I heard it pays
Your pockets looks skimp, but yo there's a bulge in my jeans
'Cause I'm only 15 and ripping rap scenes
All the magazines say that cat's hitting
But I feel like a rat getting chased by all the kittens
And all the coyotes setting up traps
But collapse on the faaaaabulous
No haps I design, a lined on the boom blue batter
Up next, me context a hex, from the complex
Rough, stuff, I puff, smoke, you wanna toke slow poke?
Nope, you can't get nothing sporty
Your girl's naughty, talking bout ""Who's shorty, who's shorty?""
But get your girl 'cause I don't wanna be the stunner
Just the runner, the funky roadrunner

[Hook]
Cool it coyote, I'm the roadrunner running things (Repeat 3x)
'Cause I'm the funky roadrunner

[Verse 2]
I shook up, honey ice tea
That's domino a girl, I'm an O and a fly MC
From the, from the west
I'm fly from the east, peace to both, we know who's best
Dip dip dip, I'm dipping landmines and pits
That coyotes set up to keep me from making hits
They want me to go pop but I'mma hip-hop the vote
So you know the only pop I'm popping is a soda
Never quote a Vanilla line when I wrote a
My mouth the trigger action and my brain's a speed loader
And yo my pockets stay loaded
(Hey Chi, I heard you blew up)  Pssssh, exploded
But not my Redhead, a Kingpin, Ed said ""Move It""
The kid got skills, don't believe me? I'll prove it
To all, from Tony to T and
My vision's perfect, but if you smoke crack, I ain't trying to see ya
The only thing I smoke are my mics
So take a hike and uuhhhhh, don't sweat my Nikes
And don't be sleeping on my statute, it's no fact
I measure up to MC's because my mic's a protractor
And it may come as a shocker
But the runner got more styles than you'll find at Foot Locker
So cool it coyote, cool it coyote
Or I'll break a coyote, I hate a coyote
And if you're coyote, I won't hang with ya
Trying to trap off, or run off and bust a cap off, get the picture?
Hope so, 'cause I don't wanna be the dunna
Just the runner, the funky roadrunner

[Hook]
Cool it coyote, I'm the roadrunner running things (Repeat 3x)
'Cause I'm the funky roadrunner
Cool it coyote, I'm the roadrunner running things (Repeat 3x)
'Cause I'm the funky roadrunner

[Verse 3]
I'm about to be boo, but before I do
I gotta say what's up to my crew
The Q, yeah, and on the check one, two
Is the Lemonader with Dres who said the choice is on you
So what's up Doc? Butcher for the cut
And can I get a nut (What?) Chill, a Beatnut
This combination you can't break, I'm hard to take
So step to me and get cut up just like a steak
Yeah, I know that's from one of my promos
But my rhymes roll on more tracks than a fat set of Ro-mo's
Total Wreck, Sean Cato got ill skills
The Op Shop cannot drop so yo just chills nills
Girls say I'm cute as a button
Fly denim, my raps' venom, I pin em
To, my trusty, my trusty old pad
No curses in these verses, respects due to mom and dad
Now tell me who's the #1 son, uhh...
Oh, you guessed it, it's the funky roadrunner

[Hook]
Cool it coyote, I'm the roadrunner running things (Repeat 3x)
'Cause I'm the funky roadrunner

[Outro]
Can you make him run? Well let me him run! (Repeat 3x)
So make him run (Check it out, y'all)
Can you make him run? Well let me him run! (Repeat 3x)
So make him run (Check it out, y'all)

[Erick Sermon]
Erick Sermon's in the house

Let's get up, let's get down
Roll with the hardcore funk, the hardcore sound
Let's get wit this, mackadocious funk material
So simple, when I rock wit the instrumental
Who am I (E-D the Green Eyed Bandit)
Control my career so I can never get stranded
But the rest are gettin Brand Nubian
Changed up they style, from jeans to suits and
Thinking about a pop record, somethin' made for the station
For a whole new relation-
Ship of a new type of scene
To go platinum and clock mad green
AKA, a sellout, the rap definition
Get off that boy, change your mission
Come back around the block
Pump Color Me Badd to the ah, tick tock
Let them know your logo, not a black thing
My background sing, my background sing for the crossover

[Hook: Roger Troutman sample]
Whatever you want
Whatever you need
I'll do it for you

[Parrish Smith]
The rap era's outta control, brother's sellin' their soul
To go gold, going, going, gone, another rapper sold
(To who) To pop and R&B, not the MD
I'm strictly hip-hop, I'll stick to Kid Capri
Funk mode, yeah, kid, that's how the Squad rolls
I know your head is bobbin' cuz the neck knows
(Not like other rappers) frontin' on they fans, they ill
Trying to chill, saying ""damn, it be great to sell a mill!""
That's when the mind switch to the pop tip
(Kid, you're gonna be large!)
Yea right, that's what the company kicks
Forget the black crowds, you're wack now
In a zoot suit, frontin' black lookin' mad foul
I speak for the hardcore (rough, rugged and raw)
I'm outta here, catch me chillin' on my next tour
From the US to the white cliffs of Dover
Strictly underground funk, keep the crossover

[Hook]

[Erick Sermon]
(So whatcha sayin) You wanna go pop goes the weasel
You know you should be rocking the fans wit something diesel
But you insist to piss me off black
So I flex the biceps so I can push em back
So real hardcore hip-hop continue wreck it
And all sucker MCs duck down and get the message
So ban the crossover, yo, who's wit me
(Hit Squad) yea, P, hit me

[Parrish Smith]
Another megablast funky dope style from cross yonder
(So help me Rhonda, help, help me Rhonda)
(Yo, from what) the crossover, yea crossing you over
Outta here, gone, peace, nice to know ya (see ya)
What a way to go out, no clout is what the fans will shout
Cause you got gassed and took the wrong route
Came on the scene, chillin', freakin' a funky dope line
But when they finish wit you (beep) flatline
Some say, ""There's no business like show business,""
But if that's the truth, please explain why is this:
Rap has been around long, makin' mad noise you see
Still I haven't seen one rapper livin' comfortably
No time to pick and wish on a four leaf clover
I stick to underground, keep the crossover

379,3596,DJ Quik,Jus Lyke Compton,22,1992-08-01,"

[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
Finally out the muthafuckin' C-P-T
Off to other cities and shit
No longer just an underground hit
Movin thangs... a local nigga made good
I made a name off of making tapes for niggas in the hood
And now, let me tell a little story
About the places that I been to and the shit that I been through
Like fightin and shootouts and bangin and shit
All because a nigga made a hit, check it
Nineteen-ninety-one, it was double or nothing not a nigga was hittin'
Then we broke out with the fonky shit
About bitches and niggas and gettin drunk and off that bud
I was doing the shit they hadn't heard of
But foolish was I to think that it wasn't no other cities like this
And they didn't like this
That Compton was the home of a foot in yo ass
Where you got blast, and now that's just a thing of the past
Let me tell ya why firsthand, we did a show up in Oak-land
And niggas was kickin up sand, to them bangin ain't nothin new
And slangin ain't nothin new
And for every nigga we done shot
They done shot two
Straight doin' locs since the sixties, before I was born
Families of young niggas mourn
So I'm just letting you know
That if ya plan to take a trip to the bay
Keep your hand on your clip

Because Oakland
Yeah, I'm telling y'all Oakland

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
Moving on to St. Louis, where they country as fuck
With gold teeth in they mouth but they still know whassup
Where it's hot as a muthafucka
Hot enough to make ya cuss
That's why I kept my ass on the bus
But later on when it cooled off we came down and met a couple of friends
Who put us up on the St. Louis cap
The Smith Center, with Big Bob, Little Steve, Tojo, Biss and Rich
And a couple of bitches
Then they took us to a man named Gus in a store
He put us down with a herringbone and shoes galore
That's when I started thinking that this wasn't like home
But then they had to prove me wrong
Cuz later that night after we did the show
We went back to the afterset, and wouldn't ya know
Yeah, Bloods and Crips start scrappin and shootin -- in Missouri?
Damn, how could this happen?

Now St. Louis
Yeah y'all, St. Louis

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
I don't think they know, they too crazy for their own good
They need to stop watchin that ""Colors"" and ""Boyz in the Hood""
Too busy claimin Sixties, tryin to be raw
And never ever seen the Shaw
But now, back to the story that I'm tellin
We packed up the tour bus one more time and started bailin
When we arrived I saw red and blue sweatsuits
When I'm thinkin bout horse dookie, and cowboy boots
I guess Texas ain't no different from the rest
And San Antonio, was just waitin to put us to the test
And before it was over the shit got deep
A nigga got shot in the face, and was dead in the street
Then they came in the club thinkin' of scrappin'
Little did they know that we was packin'
Yeah, we was puttin' em down and scaring the rest, yo
I even had to wear the bulletproof vest

Now San Antonio
Yeah, San Antonio

[Verse 4: DJ Quik]
After a month on the road
We came home and I can safely say
That L.A. is a much better place to stay
How could a bunch of niggas in a town like this
Have such a big influence on niggas so far away?
But still my story ain't over cuz I got one more to tell
And the people of Colorado, they know it well
It was all in the news and if you don't remember
I had this show I did in Denver
With a punk ass promoter, in a bunk ass skatin rink
Bitches was lovin it, but niggas was shovin and shit
To the front of the stage to throw their gang signs
But I'm getting paid so I didn't pay it no mind
Then I poured out my brew onto their face and chest
Then they start throwin soda, and fuckin up my Guess
When it was over two niggas needed stitches
Got cracked in they jaw for being punk ass bitches

Now Denver
Yeah, y'all Denver

I thought ya knew

To Mario C, you can't front on that

[Ad Rock]
Well just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris
You're eating crazy cheese like you would think I'm from Paris
You know I get fly, you think I get high
You know that I'm gone and I'm-a tell you all why

[Mike D]
So tell me who are you dissing; maybe I'm missing
The reason that you're smilin' or wildin', so listen
In my head, I just want to take 'em down
Imagination set loose and I'm gonna shake 'em down

[MCA]
Let it flow like a mud-slide
When I get on, I like to ride and glide
I've got depth of perception in my text, y'all
I get props at my mention cause I vex, y'all

[Ad Rock]
So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want? (what'cha want?)
I get so funny with my money that you flaunt
I said, ""Where'd you get your information from,"" huh?
You think that you can front when revelation comes?
(Yeah, you can't front on that)

[Mike D]
Well they call me Mike D, the ever-loving man
I'm like Spoonie Gee (whoo ooh), I'm the metropolitician (yeyeyeyeah)
You scream and you holler, about my Chevy Impala
But the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar

[MCA]
But like a dream I'm flowing without no stopping
Sweeter than a cherry pie with Reddi Whip topping
Going from mic to mic, kickin' it wall to wall
Well I'll be calling out you people like a casting call

[Ad Rock]
Ah, well, it's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride
With your know, with your flow, when you're out getting by
Believe me, what you see is what you get
And you see me, I'm comin' off as you can bet

[Mike D]
Well I think I'm losing my mind, this time
This time I'm losing my mind; that's right
I said I think I'm losing my mind, this time
This time, I'm losing my mind

Yeah, you can't front on that

[MCA]
But little do you know about something that I talk about
I'm tired of driving, it's due time that I walkabout
But in the meantime, I'm wise to the demise
I've got eyes in the back of my head so I realize

[Ad Rock]
Well I'm Dr. Spock, I'm here to rock, y'all
I want you off the wall, if you're playing the wall
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)

[Mike D]
Y'all suckers write me checks and then they bounce
So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
See I'm the long leaner Victor the Cleaner
I'm the illest motherfucker from here to Gardena

[MCA]
Well I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
You've got the rhyme and reason, but got no cause
But if you're hot to trot, you think you're slicker than grease
I've got news for you crews, you'll be sucking like a leech

Yeah, you can't front on that

So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)

{B-REAL'S VERSE on ""So What'cha Want (SOUL ASSASSIN REMIX)""}
I got the big brown boots
When you wanna get kicked like a rhyme
From the heart and the mind
There was a time when the blunt got lit
I take a hit of the weed and then blew a smoke screen
No Visine just a little, Afro-Sheen
And a High Times magazine
I like to smoke y'all, but the pigs come sweating
They like the smell of the weed that I'm smoking
They can't have none of the number one sess-stash
So keep your hands off the hash
Don't act rash, cause if you move too fast
I'll pull out my gat and blast your sorry ass...

And you can kiss my ass, haha
That was the ""M"" to the ""I"" to the ""K"" to the ""E"" to the ""D"" y'all

385,3644,Miles Davis,The Doo-Bop Song,20,1992-08-15,"

Lets kick a verse for my man called Miles
Seems to me his musics gonna be around for a long while
Cuz hes a multi-talented and gifted musician who can play any position
Its no mystery that youre no risk to me
Cuz Im a lover and tell your girl to throw a kiss to me
And jump in bed and have a fight with the pillows
Turn off the lights and let the J give it to ya
And let the trumpet blow as I kick this
Cuz rap is fundamental and Miles sounds so wicked
A little taste of be-bop sound with the backdrop
Of doo-wop and this is why we can call it the doo-bop

Now go ahead and play like a wannabe
You know its gonna be
I hate to cut the troats of mcs up in
Front of me
When blows makes the A want to sing
My rhymes be shining on brothers
Like they flippin on they high beams
And when I just come through
You think you badcuz somebody seen you
Climbing the tree like Jack-Be-Nimble
Yo, Miles blow the trumpet off the symbol
Performed by Easy Mo Bee
Miles Davis style is different, you can't
Describe it as pacific
He rip, rage and roar, no time for watchin
Andy Griffith
You can(whistle)all you want, go head
While he take to doo-wop and mix it with be-bop
Just like a maker in the shoe shop, Easy Mo
Bee will cream you
Like the nougat
And usually we doo-wop but since Miles Wanna cool out
You can do that Miles, blow your trmpet
Show the people
Just what its to do

[Professor X]
Come one, come all. We have the elixir that cures all that ails you
Traveling the four corners of the road. Straight from the well, as it
Pointed the hill the remnant to your hell(?). Come, Yahweh! Come
Joshua! Come, David! Confrontation with the soul has come!

[Brother J]
In the ways of God!
Xodus, feel the vibes of the wrath of God!
Spoke the biological are God, one
Systematic terror, that's forever
Big Lord shredder, legendary weed getter
The dark president, the dark sun resident
Will give more reason to impeach a president
And all the puppets in the other square lay
Supporting three Ks and Amerikkka can wait
So now a brother bears fruits and herbs
Cause apples pie's toxic, it slurs my words
And how could I reach a Black nation?
The vibration, sensations, like that!
Is that a combat? And either pimp slap?
There's other missionaries who would have me off track
But heed is a lead is a positive sin
And you can't you can't stop me, so let's stop your grin
So prepare your mind like a [sic] A to the M
From the Genesis to the Revelations and
Here comes the kick of the Xodus riff
It goes a little something like this, check it out:
1-2-3 and a 3-2-1
Here comes the rhythm of the warrior's dun
Shut out the mind to the God Te-Hun
As we begin with the warrior's flex
Yeah!
Fee to the Fi and Fo to the Fum!
I smell the game of four wicked mortal men
Try to play my mind, try to play me humdrum
But now it gets dumb, and here comes the sum
More and more and more, and this loud cry, ""Free""
Siggy-siggy glance and the
Now my attitude is worse than an AK
Clip never stopping when it's time to kick or spray!
I jiggy-jiggy-jiggy-judge a brother won't budge
Now kick it to the middle, cause that's how you get 'em
Now, God, now what's a brother do?
I try to keep my patience, but now I'm out the truth
One-Zero, now I crew shoed
Bad attitude cause I have enough food
Next days, they try to condemn me
But, yo, I'd just be me as it remains it will be
Friggy way these verbs stick the whole nine
Part of the thighs of the cosmic child
Got your clean cut American
Strictly African, my look is terrorism
What's the seravist, don't call me Communist!
I'm just a bro'!
Not New Jack or Joe
And Freedom or Death, this means I'm going for broke
It means my life is my death
My attitude should reflect
I met a dude, the cosmic god
All father respect

[Professor X]
The Xodus! Come forward, young black. What ails you? You say the
Value in your system rejects to feeling outrage? Take a sip. Ah! Feel
The surge. The red! The black! The green! Through your veins to your
Heart, come stomp with me!

[Brother J]
Back from the peak of Heaven, the depths of Hell
If you feel voodoo, and here's my spell
To teach my people, and, Yes, rock well
And very, very black
I hear some niggas talking 'bout they'll paint the White House black
I'd blow the sucker up and pressure on the attack
And Frontline, you'll find, the government swine
Find themselves caught up in a bind
But when will you figure
A vibe in a vigour
A pro-Black nigga, Black nigga, Black nigga!
Or would you ask me if I'm a humanist?
Or down with Swiss Miss or anyone from the abyss?
We're down to the core
I can't take it no more!
With no legend or
Almost prove law
With no funny moves for the earthly residents
Cause Dark Sun Riders were firmly handling
So, on to the school of common sense
In God we trust, the Xodus

[Professor X]
Come diddy-dum. To the flag: the red the black and the green! Ah!
Alafia (?) and do good. Tu-tah and mallah (?), da-da. Peace!

[ VERSE 1: Qur'an ]
I strike back with the mic --and track--
When it comes to drums it's like I hyper-react
My mind starts to generate words that penetrate
Then I eliminate suckers who imitate
Once again I reveal the skill
Money's growin' like grass with the mass appeal
It doesn't matter hardcore or commercial
I'm universal, this set rehearsal
The name's Qur'an, consider me a brighter man
I'm climbin charts like Spiderman
A legend in my own time with the microphone I'm
One of the world's most electrifyin homie
I dust MC's off like a antiques
So sit back and let this young man speak
Sorry suckers, take a hike
But for now I'mma pass the mic

Pass the mic yo, pass the mic (x3)
Yo Tarik, why don't you grab the mic?

[VERSE 2: Tarik]
I come to wiggity wiggity rip the rhyme
Again again again I go for what I know
More ready then I ever been
My rhymes luck against you all because
It gets wicked never coming off soft
So we could kick it I'm slicker quicker with
The vocals, my pocket stay thicker than bifocals
So here's a telescope if you can't tell its dope
You put your hand in the spot naw I mean
To tell you nope
Coming with more hits than Lorence Socks
No more those bored wacks or dreadlocks
So take notes to every move I'm making cause
Rick Gz a definitely get your booty shaking
Ripping them up throwing them down
Groomed as a pound with a hardcore sound
Right about now I'm doin just what I like
My time's up, so I'ma pass the mic

Pass the mic yo, pass the mic (x3)
Yo Taji, why don't you grab the mic

[VERSE 3: Taji]
I'm known to wiggity rip, rip the rhyme
Like jack the ripper
Slick So I get slighty slicker I got more juice than
Citrus so suckas can't get with this
I ring more bells than a jehovahs witness somebody
Said I went out like a grape
I wouldn't hurt you physically, I hurt you
I hurt you on tape, sit back, realax and just chill
Cause I'm about to give you the definition of the
Real deal
My name's Taji time to release my ground, for
Everyone standing time to get on down, then you wonder
How the heck I'm on stage, ripping up the scene just like the
12 gauge
Then let me flip , then rip, and turn the page plus I get kissed very dope for my age
Right now I'm about to take flight
So I'm gonna pass the mic

Pass the mic yo, pass the mic (x3)
Mentally Gifted, why don't you grab the mic?

[ VERSE 4: Mentally Gifted ]
Here's a quick flashback by me on the last track
Get a whiff of this, you won't want none of your cash back
Continuous flavor, I always seem to set you straight
You heard so many wack songs, I couldn't let you wait
Another minute, better yet another second
Cause once I give 'em 1-2 check you know the brother's wreckin
So put me in the books, one of the best who did it
I'm the top soloist, all the rest should quit it
Ain't nothin to it, I'mma do it like I'm hittin skins
And at the same time you can believe I'm gettin ends
I catch fits cause it gets irritative when
Suckers act like they got a creative pen
But they don't, so they need to just settle down
Because it's time to put my foot on the pedal now
Some suckers thought I really couldn't do it right
But for now I'm gonna pass the mic

[Verse 1: Speech]
See I was resting at the park minding my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm dating
Investigation maybe she was demonstrating
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was going great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started bugging out
Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route
Disrespecting my black queen
Holding their crotches and being obscene
At first I ignored them cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear [Boo !]
I was a target cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me ?
Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me

[Hook]
I am everyday people (2x)

[Verse 2: Speech]
I told the niggas please let us pass, friend
I said please cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube
But I had to take the brother out for being rude
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story y'all of a black man
Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African

[Hook]

The moral of the story is you better look very hard at who you're stepping to, cause you might get killed or shot and it's not worth it. Africans need to be loving each other and unite

See, most of my life I never had shit
I felt like an outcast, treated like a misfit
Damn near didn't make it on my day of birth
Thinking was I really supposed to be on this planet earth
I take a deep breath, and then another follows
Cause hard shit is kinda hard to swallow
See, it's rough being a loner
Not knowing any given day and time I could wind up a goner
See, people got it bad from jump street
And being short is just another strike against me
I used to get funny looks cause I was small
And trying to make it was like running through a brick wall
Given the odds I was up against, bro
The average nigga would've quit a long time ago
But now I've got a record out
I'm doing shows, people paying to see me turn it out
Now I'm the spice around town
It's funny how an album can change a nigga's life around
I got friends and bitches on my dick
But when they look at Richard all they see is Bushwick
Sometimes I don't know a friend from a foe
And every different day it's a different fuckin ho
And now that my pockets are getting bigger
I'm meeting hoes who only wanna juice a nigga
They tell me that they love me and all that
But really they just wait for me to fall flat
So they can get me for my income
Take me for all I got, and then some
Like Trina, you dig
I fucked up and got too attached to the bitch's kid
Knowing that she used the baby to use me
Took him out my life, mentally abusing me
But as the time went by I got another slimmy
And she was just like the first one screaming ""Gimme""
But not in the exact same way
She had a different type of game she liked to play
Her name was Crystal, she played the quiet type
And for a little while shit seemed alright
But just like the first ho, homie
When shit got hectic, the bitch broke out on me
And it's getting out of hand, gee
Cause nobody seems to understand me
Reminiscing got me feeling kinda low
I broke out the Ever-Clear and then I drunk some mo'
Until it was all gone
Now I'm looking for somebody to take my pain out on
But not just anybody, gee
I'mma take that on to Mica cause she's the closest to me
Full of that Ever-Clear and high on that buddah
Get to the house all I'm thinking 'bout is shooting her
Cause shooting her would be sweet
But you know what'd be sweeter? if I make her shoot me
Call me crazy, but that's what I'm thinking
I'm tripping, from all that smoking weed and drinking
But I knew she wouldn't do it on her own, so I provoked her
Punched her, kicked her, and chocked her
She still wouldn't grab the gun
And at that time I wasn't thinking about no one
Damn near crazy I went and grabbed the baby
Held him by the door and said I'mma throw his ass out, ho
She went to crying, somebody stop him
I said: you better grab the motherfucking gun or I'mma drop him
She snatched the baby out of my hands
We started fighting, punching, scratching, and biting
When we fell on the bed, check this shit
All kinds of crazy shit was going through my head
So I ran and got the gun and came back to her
Loaded it up and handed the gat to her
I grabbed her hand and placed the gun to my eye muscle
She screamed stop and then we broke into another tussle
Yo, during the fight the gun went off quick
Damn! Aw shit, I'm hit
(""Aw... my eye, I can't see
Why you shoot me in the eye?
I would've shot you in the body
Why you shot me in the eye?"")
Riding in the ambulance everything is hectic
I can't get a grip, I just can't check this
Everybody's crying, could it be I'm dying
Bullet in my head, in the bed was lying
Where's Mica? I wanna tell her I love her
With an IV in my arm I took a picture for an album cover
Goddamn, the shit's a trip, gee
5 different doctors with needles trying to stick me
I hear my family hollering he needs us
During the confusion, man, I seen Jesus
My mom's on the phone long-distance from New York
Here comes the doctors again trying to rip me apart
I got a monkey on my back, I can't shake it
I'm having suicidal thoughts, hoping that I don't make it
But I'mma make it cause something's steady urging me
5 hours passed, I made it through surgery
And the doctor said I wouldn't make it through the night
But god told me everything is gonna be alright
And I'm glad that I'm here, gee
But it's fucked up I had to lose an eye to see shit clearly

[Verse 1]
You know I used to be a player, fly girl layer and a heartbreaker
Lovemaker, backbreaker but then I made a
Mistake yes I fell in love with this ill chick
Sweatin' me for money, my name and the dilsnick
My homeboys told me drop her cuz it would be to my benefit
She used to say I'd better quit hanging with those derelicts
Romancing is my thing but I can't swing with no scheming hoes
Wherever my Beemer goes you know that I'm driving
Surviving in the 90's is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
I bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
Do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
Now back to the ex-girls, ex-lovers, ex-friends
It made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
She phones me and goes on about her new life now
I wish she knew right now
I think she's busted let's discuss it
When I was with her no trust, just fights
Just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
Bow I got my new girl or as I say my baby doll
But I'm still gettin' crazy calls, my ex-girl's got balls
Don't wanna play the field cuz I get lovin' at home base
Don't gimme no long face just exit with a grace
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl cuz I'm on with the next girl

[Hook]
Next
Cuz girls look so good

[Verse 2]
She had much loot, liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
Liked to have me near cuz of my savoir faire
The time we shared was brief cuz I needed relief
From her high-classed antics and all her conceit
Now she's crying wolf and I like don't wanna hear that
I told her the bear facts when things started out
She wines and she pouts about how I did her bad
Yo but she'd tried to buy me
Even tempt me with the hiney
I fell for a sec cuz the clothes were real fly
I could almost feel I
Would give into her whims
Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature
I told her hey look I can no longer date ya
Tried to pimp with bank and fell short, your ship sank
Many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, nuff respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl cuz I'm straight with the next girl

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You saw my moms in the supermarket and gave her your number
You asked how's my sister then asked how's my brother
Didn't ask about my father cuz you know he ain't like ya
Every time I left for your crib yo he'd really get hyper
The advice he used to give me makes much sense now
I can't believe I used to let you break my confidence down
You used to ask me why the Hell did I wanna live in Brooklyn?
You messed up my flow although you were good-lookin'
Yes darlin' was fly and this was the problem
Cuz back in the day she had me scheming and robbin'
To get her things to wear so when she went to the club
All eyes were on her - And, who? Me? I just bugged
Caught in between felling proud and feeling more like a sucker
Had to go undercover, get away, find another
Been in Brooklyn 9 years and been around the world, too
I've seen so many fly girls and I knew just what to do
I went from ex- to next took my time with each one
And you know they still love me so stop jellin' me hon
I went home to see mom and I saw you at the bus stop
Must I stop? Nah, I think not
You and I are the past c'est la vie, much respect girl
But now you're my ex-girl & I'm out with the next girl
Out...

A Little fat kid who ain't have shit, lived on Lorado Street
Don't get me wrong, cause we was far from po' though
But up-to-date tennis shoes was far from affordable
A runaway, well, that describes me best
Cause if things ain't go my way, it was time to jet
I ran back and forth from my mom's to my pop's house
And by the 9th grade I was a high school drop-out
15 and my life done went bad
By this time I was livin with my dad
Not thinkin 'bout what's goin on in life
And if I have to carry a gun or a knife
Will I have to use it, if so, then it's on

But I can tell you this: that he is up on the game
Seven in the morning, I'm dressed in my Levis

Who don't be knowin my name, I tear the frame out ya punks
I make ya slide, make ya slip, make ya wanna backflip
I get biz with the skit, I DJ like Quik
The topnotch of the block, cause I carry a Glock
Holy hot rocks I'm hot, so give up the props
My style is HUMMIN CUMMIN ATCHA, duck or get backed up
Dispatcher: 'Red, get freaky to the rapture'
So come on light the buddha check your honey while I scoop her
The Superfly, Jimmy Fly Snuka rips the roof off
Then hook off on your crew, to the check of one to two
It's you, who? (AGA-AHHH! WWAAAAAH!) Redman with the Kung-Fu
Come on and get down and boogie oogie with the ruffneck
Hit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette
But first get your tables I roast your whole record label kids
Yo E (Whassup G?) Briiiiiidge!

I do the hustle like Russell, Rush the stage with Simmons
Deadly venom, makes me Poison like Michael Bivins
Or a cobra, pop more pop than Coca-Cola
Next to Yoda I'm a Star at War, plus roller coaster
I got my mind made up GURRRRL, come on and get it if you widdit troop
Krush Groovin smooth as the lightning loops
The kind of loops I sample from a James Brown group
I give credit, cause I'm cautious, about lawsuits
PsychoBetaP-Funk, got styles hard as tree trunks
For real punk, you got a blunt, light it cause I need one
And get down with the irrelevant funk to make ya jump
With the fly human being, watch me freak it in Korean

Chu ri ka pi kyura mulla kara
Nu gu nya nada na na nun Redman
Na bo da challan nom hana do upda ...
... Nah Duke, forget it

I rip shop in hip-hop I get props my lip rocks
The rap stuff's more spooky than movies from Hitchcock
Sit back relax let me rip to the funk track
And press rewind if I haven't blown your mind (""REE-WIND!!"" --])

""Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind""
""Press rewind if I..""

HA-UHH, let me get busy with the funky fly stuff
Cause I cut your freakin eyes, fuck Bruce Willis because I die rough
It's the Funkadelic Redman and I hit ya with the
Funkadelic level, the P-Funk, the devil
The spectular, Blacula, bust holes like Dracula
Loaded of course, more Legend than Acura
I'm swift, I like big spliffs so I tisk tisk a tasket
Plus keep the Glock in my basket
I cough up a lung cause I freak it with the tongue
Cause I can 'Wax on! Wax off!' like Daniel-son
Do the yea yea, boogey say up jump the boogey
To the boogey to the boogey thanks to E cause he hooked me
So fuck what ya heard, word to herb, cause I mac-

I walk down the street, yo pick any one
I see a little ruffneck kid with a gun
I said, ""Little homeboy what's up with the Glock 19?""
He said a damn crack fiend just went and took his mama's life
And now the kid's over there smoking the pipe
I said, ""Guilt will let him know what he did
And you don't need to go to jail, you're just a kid
Give me the gun little G, just cool it down
You've got a lot to live for you're college bound.""
And so he screams and cries, we start huggin
On the corner in Ft. Greene, we're buggin
Tears drip as we walk to the crib
And I'mma try to be there to comfort the kid
I woke up it's a brand new day
Little man blew himself away
And I'm scorned, an emotional thorn
And I'm lost in the storm

Well back in the hood, understood, I mean understand
The conspiracy upon the first man
Death to the Klan pump the fists that's connected
To the elbow joined by cartilage to the dark hand
And the plan to conserve this confused violent land
Different races, faces share the same spaces
Sewed by arrogant laces
Taste this peach its real, real sweet
Extra reasoning seasoning to the weak
Will be done before the sun starts to nova
Or we'll be over
Reveal the passion button now hit it
Cause no one is born a bigot
Delete what you have engraved in your mind
And throw up the peace sign
And maybe be reborn or be lost in the storm

Well it's ninety-two we will make it to ninety-three
With no P-E, A-C-E
It won't happen so stop your damn finger tappin
Find the music of peace and start rappin
The answer lies in your hearts then your minds
And maybe then we can save human kind
Put away the guns and have fun was a strong motto in ninety-one
But a Woodstock ninety-two the many join the few to delete the racist crew
Without death cause that will be illogical
Peace will cover every newspaper article
So now then, where do we start
Everybody knows they have to play a part
Open your minds and clear your minds
And throw up the peace signs
Cause to scorn, be reborn, everybody let's be reborn
Or be lost in the storm

Feat. Jhiame
[Opening Skit: Some Female Complaining]
I don't wanna what I'm gonna do!
Will, he doesn't spend time with me, he doesn't respect me
It seems like I'm just staying for his convenience

[Verse One: Willie D]
Baby don't cry, pull yourself together
Let Willie D take you to that other level
And love you the right way miss
Compare to me, Johnny don't know shiiit!
I'm in a class all by myself
Get some of this, and you don't want nobody else

So if you plan on staying with your groom
Don't come around my bedroom
Get your hands off the bed poles
Married, went, nearly hit the most
See after a few times in the sack
Homeboy, trends to get a little relax
He starts hanging out late with his friends
Yeah! ~ that's when I come in
But not into his house cause that ain't nothing but a slaughter
We go to my place, forget the room of Thirty Martyrs
Now, once you get your woman alone
It's on like a pattern of neck bone
And when I call she pretends that I'm her girlfriend
She might call me San or Fran but I'm the Clean Up Man

[Chorus: Jhiame]
Willie D, is the Clean Up Man
He will sweep your girlfriend, off her feet yeah!
The reason I know; so much about him
It's because he scooped dolls, and all the girls in my hood

[Verse Two: Willie D]
Swept her right up off her feet, and entered the Jag'
Cause you was using her face as a punching bag
I'm not going next door myself neither
But if you gotta beat her, you don't need her
It ain't no thing, for me to be lovable
Cause after being treated like that, she is so gullible
Like a masseur, I rub her thighs, neck and back
And give her some of this Afro-dizyak
Now, what you know about that boy?
You just start, you're still in Kinder Garden
Talking about you got that whip appeal, and all that stuff
She told me you couldn't even fill it up
Yo, don't call me a snail
Cause if the shoe was on the other foot, you'll take my girl
Willie D, is for real
If you don't take care of your business, then somebody else will
I'ma give your girl what she really wants
In the mid-night hour, I'll be her confidant
And when you hit her and make her cry
I'll be there to dry her eye, I'm the Clean Up Man

[Chorus]
[Skit #2: Some Male Complaining]
You know that's all you do is complain
I work, I keep the lights on, I put food on the table
I buy you clothes, I mean I don't understand you
What else do you want me to do? - (Just think of romance back, baby)

[Verse Three: Willie D]
You was a big time money maker, yeah, work a hard work
Or whatever the hell you wanna call it
But when you leave, you girl don't miss ya
Because the Clean Up Man is in the picture
You're clucking them big bills
But money can't buy you love, just a cheap thrill
And dyke gets old and abandoned
Now, you're looking for love and understanding
Pouring out your heart about she just had a soul mate
Too much, too little, too late
Now when you come home, your feelings are hurt
Cause there's a sign on the door, it says: Men At Work
Double overtimer's what I stack
You know, I'm getting the job done cause I got on my hard hack
Getting paid, working up her sweat, no customer leaves upset
They're all wanna come back
Cause they know with Willie D it ain't going to be none of that
Wam, bam, thank you madam, and hit the tub
I don't have sex baby, I make love
I'm the Clean Up Man

[Chorus]

[Verse Four: Willie D]
You better shave up then fly straight
Cause the Clean Up Man can't wait to take you place
He comes in all shapes, sizes and colors
His lovers all your aunts, cousins, sisters and mothers
Now, he could be your brother, or the Mailman
Your uncle, your father, and even your best friend
So next time you try to show her off
Keep an eye on the Clean Up Man, he's in the house

[Chorus]
[Outro: Jhiame]
And like a fool I thought I had all to myself
Like a fool I thought I had all to myself
Like a fool I thought I had all to myself
Like a fool I thought I had all to myself
And he is the clean up man, he is the clean up man
He is the clean up man, he is the clean up man..

[Intro: DJ Bobcat]
Hey, hey Ren, hey check this out loc
Hey man I've been hearing a gang of niggas
Talking a whole lot of unnecessary bullshit man
What if one of them trick ass niggas
Come at you the wrong way, loc?

[Verse 1]
I'll beat a nigga's ass on this track just for the hell of it
There the motherfucking piece of pussy there's no tell of it
I don't give a damn I'll beat a nigga like he stole something
And then I'll let the motherfucker know where Ren is coming from
(Where you from, loc?)
I'm from Compton, everybody's on the wagon
I'm looking for niggas that's thinking
That they're the shit, that's who I'm tagging
Never asking questions I just go right in and do it
And if you're thinking that you can fuck with Ren
You bitch already blew it
Like I said before, fools want up in my shoes
But after fucking with me
They giving up rapping and singing the blues
Me and DJ Train dropping bombs like a B-2
So you should get the picture or if not, you get a preview
That we don't take no shit
Cause MC Ren ain't a nigga that you wanna try and fuck with
Kick a little ass in my spare time
To keep myself occupied when I'm not busting up a rhyme
Writing that shit that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

[Hook]
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10

[Verse 2]
Now throw your hands in the air and let me see ya slap a ho
Start the violence going on through an MC Ren show
I don't give a fuck if niggas is fighting in the crowd
I only got one concern, that's my vocals pumping loud
I'm standing on the stage I got my niggas to my right
I bust a couple of verses
Then jump in the crowd and get with the fight
I hit a nigga off in the head with a chair
The reason for that, the motherfucker he was standing there
Then DJ Train will grab the gauge - just in case a motherfucker
Talks shit; he'll be the victim on the front page
He's on his way to the morgue - to kick it with the rest
Of them motherfuckers that I gave free room and board
So when you at my show
Let me see ya throw your hands up in the air and slap a ho
Cause that's the only noise I wanna hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

[Hook]
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10

[Verse 3]
The final frontier makes the average nigga wonder
Why they do a couple of records and then they go up under
Try to copy Ren but Ren just can't be duplicated
Motherfuckers making pussy shit so I come in and fade it
Slap the niggas like bitches if they have to talk back
Put my foot so deep in their ass they have a hole and not a crack
The shit just makes a nigga laugh, cause niggas be coming to me
Asking me why did I leave size 10 Nike in their ass
I tell them I had to do it was part of the plan
To try to stop the fools jacking off by the hand
Putting wack records in the make
By using R&B fucking singers in the god damn breaks
Trying to go commercial but they started out street
That's reason why they're still drivin in their two feet
Thinking they can diss Ren's flow, but singing and dancing
Don't go with the format that I be using in my show
It's just hardcore niggas acting crazy on the stage
Wearing gangsta clothes yo and spitting on the hoes
Doing that shit that ya love to hear
Cause MC Ren is the final frontier

[Hook]
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
Who is it? - The black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10

Cuando entro, when I come in, suckers frontin'
Me mira another bilingual from villa
Vengo con un ejemplo, check the tempo
Ahhh... esta chingon el instrumento
Ya oiste, como somos
Yo no jodo, I gots the soul though
And you can hear it, en las congas
Tribal ceremony as the Hill gets stronger
Don't be such a leva, what u got for la cabeza?
Hey homes, pass the cerveza
Before I have to go and push up on your esa
Hmm she's fine, son que fresca
Here homes have a hit of this yesca
Teach you enseño el leño lo prendo
Now you know, that I am in the centro
Where you live, si tu puedes
Nowadays you ain't shit without your cohetes
Something like it's gangbang, vatos quieren BANG BANG!

Cause everyday things get a little crazier
As I step to the microphone area
First I claim my city, puro Los Angeles
Yeah (you know homes) that's where the calles is
Vatos waitin' on me, along with the heinas
Catchin' all the sweat for what I said to one-timer
So when you see me at the party or the baile
Before I got here I was gaffled in the calle
Like gabacho who said I was borracho
Had an attitude while you tried to play me macho
Just relax, calmado mijo

Power to the people & the beats

[Verse 1]
Some people accuse some people of crimes
Some people get away with losing my rhyme
They don't like where I'm coming from
So they play dumb
Dumb diggety-dumb-diggety-dumb
But I'm telling you what they do
Everybody plays a fool
While the real thief cools in a pool
He who got the finger on the war button
Talking loud & saying nothing
TV got them bigger than life
All he needs is a knife
Who's the criminal?

[Verse 2]
To the blind, deaf & dumb
Hard to see them coming
But they come, here they come
Don't be dumb-diggety-dumb
Politicians writing bad checks
Still they getting wrecked
Going for a niggas neck
Rolling in a blue & white gang
Ready to bang-biggety-bang
Hanging 'round the hanging rope
Nope n-o-p-e

Politician passing a bill, paid in full
C-note rocking in a pocket
How they living making sure they
Locking us up I got a feeling I'm.. (sound effects)
When it come to something we say
What they don't like is a brother like me on the mic
In fact to the gritty ain't none of us wack

How the hell do we set stuffed
In the back of a cell
On an isle
Ain't it wild
What's criminal?

Power to the People & the Beats

Only if I had one more time to kick
The rhythm that keep ripping down the door
So the real criminals get exposed behind the clothes
Doors and the suits that make and break the law
Looking for my own cause I had enough bull
I can't understand it must be crooked way they planned it
Police supposed to keep the peace
But I can't trust 'em
So I keep my piece
Loaded & cocked
Cause I don't miss the block
I'm talking about the ones who don't get chained to the rock
Those who got away with the dirt and the grime
While we go away for the neighborhood crime
Never liked what I saw in the law

Hold up, let me tell you who I am
I'm Mr. Funkee
AKA The Motherfucking Man
That's right the man
Girlfriend got her knocked up
Big money clocker, Chief Rocka, boot knocker
MC's are on their knees, MC's I'm locking 'em in my trunk and
The Funk is no punk and I kick Donuts like Dunkin'
People scream ""Oooh aah"" because what the Lords did
I'm liver than 355 newborn kids
Then somebody tests me, there's guaranteed a trial
They gotta burn like the [?] to be half as good as I am
So bottom line look out for [?] and try to test me and
Funkee Man will walk all over your ass like a pedestrian
Not the type of kid that you get over on brother
You talk about me? I talk about your mother
No need to sweat a record, Funkee Man packs mad skills
I got a book of rhymes that stretch from here to the Catskill's
I guess you thought you scared me with your ass like hokey spooky
You need to get a Pamper, cause the stuff you wrote was dookie
I know that when you wanted to touch the vital part [?]
As soon as you open your mouth your breath starts stinking
Sorry you've been had, see my style is simply mad
If rap was parenthood, you might have to call me dad
Or grandpop, my [stamina] is crazy long and I'm
Hoping to make you part of this cause yo you ain't that fly

One stomp, two stomp
Chomp, chomp, chomp that's how I eat my comp'
DoItAll has got style so dig it, dig it
(DoItAll, DoItAll!)
What?
(Go 'head and kick it!)
I am what I am so I guess I'm just flam
And slam like lightening so I say ""Shazam""
I'm different
So don't compare me to another
But call an undertaker cause I'm burying motherfuckers
At hype shows, the beat rose from Check It to Psycho
You might wanna turn your head before I tug my nuts low
Last kid who stepped up, got strangled with the mic cord
(Haha, straighten that ass out like an ironing board)
Noooow, no no no, I'm not with the bullshit
DoItAll and Funkee Man come equipped
With the tech of my nine and nine mil' clip
But not from the barrel it's straight from the lips
So back up brother
My tongue is blasting
I'll eat that ass today and tomorrow I'm fasting
MC's can not see this, I'm like a chameleon
On a scale to one to ten I'm like a nine (million!)
They told you I was nice then they didn't tell no lies
I'm better with the mic than your grandma is with pies
Just hand me the mic, it's guaranteed that I will rock it
I got so many skills that they're falling out my pocket

If stepping to us is wrong then I don't know what y'all be thinking

They call me Mr. Funkee Man but you're the one who's stinking

Then talk behind our back like you're better than somebody

MC's are scared of me so they should call me Funkee Kruger

[DoItAll]
Noooow I'm the rapper assuming to give them daily allowances
If rap was body weight you'd weigh like two pounds, three ounces

[Mr. Funkee]
What ya needed?
I'm undefeated
What you expect?

[DoItAll]
So many titles under my belt I gotta wear it on my neck

[Kris Kross]
I missed the bus.. I missed the bus..
I missed the bus.. I missed the bus..

[Verse 1/Daddy Mac]
I went to bed late but I didn't think late would EFFECT ME
Early came around then late wouldn't LET ME
Wake up - WAKE UP - so I can get dressed
I guess my body was mad cause I gave it no rest
And when I finally did awake it was a quarter to 8:00
Jumped in the shower and I know I was late
Stepped out, put on my jeans and my Ewings'
And said to myself if I miss school I'm ruined
But I ran down hill and I RUSHED RUSHED
I ran down the hill TRYIN TO CATCH THE BUS
Now I'm hopin to myself everything is cool
Standin on my block like a fool
But (1) I'm all alone and (2) the bus is gone
(3) if I miss school this weekend I'll be at home
Can somebody come real fast to my rescue
I'm stuck at the crib and I don't know what to do

[Hook: repeat 2x]
I missed the bus [ohh]
I missed the bus
I missed the bus [ohh]
And that is somethin I will never ever ever do again

[Verse 2/Mac Daddy]
I was up - HE WAS UP - but I laid back down
Thinkin I could chill 'til the time came around
And I did - HE DID - but a little too long
Cause when I woke up yo the bus was gone
I almost broke my neck, tryin to get out the door
And I chased the bus 'til my feet was sore
On the trail - THE TAIL - but I couldn't catch up
I guess it must have been my day for me to have bad luck
Cause I lost my lunch money, book bag busted
Scuffed up my sneakers and I'm really disgusted
And when I got to school it was the same old thing
Stepped in the class and the school bell rang
It was nothin I could do, I tried to explain
But the teacher treated me like I was playin a game
YOU LOSE YOU LOSE - the day was a no win
I learned to never miss my bus again

[Intro: Pete Rock]
Uh, yeah. Uh-huh
We got Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth
And we're here to tell you to...
And that's a fact, baby
Now you're gonna kick some lyrics
Like this, c'mon...

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
Walk the fine chalk line, and put the needle to the grind
Representin' one kind, seeing eye for the blind
Witness what I carry on bears a further purpose
From how we do slam a few, then you want to purchase
A dialogue of funk, you love to pop it in your trunk
I win, more disciplined than a Shaolin monk
Pete Rock and C.L., well set to spark it
The powerful target to destroy the black market
But when you say black, listen, I don't know, you lose me
I guess another beggar can afford to be choosey
I come to the maximum, artist on a major label
Any duplication of this one is fatal
On one two five, I gotta hit ya live
Beat your ass with my tape, any race or shape
Cuz if they got mine, they got yours too
But together here's what we gotta do

[Chorus: Pete Rock]
Tell 'em... straighten it out
Ah, yeah... straighten it out
You know this is the word (say what?)... straighten it out
That's right y'all... straighten it out (say what?)
You got to... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out... yeah
Straighten it out... it's like that (say what?)

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
The funk legacy I pass on, clearancy for high rates
Every time we sample all the past time greats
Stick it in the SP-1200 beat, I make a loop
Lovely, way to troop in a Lexus coupe
Just a little bit, set to make a whole lot happen
The musical inside my rappin'
Written by the C.L., produced by the P.R
And add in any credit that you heard thus far
I start from scratch, cuz the bassline's critical
Better than the original who first made it
Now you want to sue me, but fans never boo me
Believe I know the times, we been broke, too, G
Here's another sample clear, see ya, get the hell outta here
Like a bootleg, you're over for the year
You'll only get the credit where the credit is due
So, listen, what I shout out is true

[Chorus: Pete Rock]
Yeah, true... straighten it out
You gots to tell 'em to... straighten it out
(Say what?)... straighten it out
You got to tell 'em to... straighten it out
(Say what?)... straighten it out
That's right... straighten it out
C'mon (say what?)... straighten it out
That's right... straighten it out
Straighten it out (say what?)

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
Like the strands of lamb's wool, I'm thinkin' that's said
Here to go to the head and count the locks on a dred
I and I'd 'mit to verify, goin' to multiply
A theory many thought a conspiracy
Here to let you know that it applies to all of us
You're no exceptions to the rule and that's a plus
Cause who Jah bless, let no one curse
Straighten out what I be about, reckon above the clout
And let the management work for me
Because I don't need the unnecessary hostility
A proper marketing plan so we can gobble up the dough
Straighten it out, so everybody know
The kids are official with the purpose of a smooth surface
Kickin' the service one time to make 'em nervous
We're finally here and very long overdue
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew

[Chorus: Pete Rock]
You gotta... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
You gotta... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out... you got to
Straighten it out... c'mon (say what?)
Straighten it out
All black people must... straighten it out
Say what?

[Outro: Pete Rock]
Straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out
The YG's, they must... straighten it out
The Hilltop, they must...straighten it out
The whole money-earnin' must... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out
Come on... straighten it out
Ah, yeah... straighten it out (to close)

417,3896,Compton's Most Wanted,Hood Took Me Under,22,1992-10-24,"

I got another gang story to tell
Peep, about how a black nigga was born in hell
And right then and there it's no hope
Cause a nigga can't escape the gangs and the dope
Damn! And when its black on black, that makes it shitty
Can't survive in the Compton city
And fool thats bet
Cause when you grow up in the hood, you gots ta claim a set
Chyeah, Its not that you want to but you have to
Don't be a mark, cause niggas might laugh you
Straight off the mutherfuckin block
Can't deal with bustas so they asses get clocked
Chyeah, who gives a fuck about another
Only got love for my fuckin gang brothers
Chyeah but I'm young so nobody would wonder
That the hood would take me under

[Hook:]
Always strapped and eager to peel a cap
The hood done took me under

Now I'm a few ages older
Got hair on my nuts and I'm a little bit bolder
And puttin in work, I has to do my fuckin part
I'm down for the hood and its planted in the heart
Fool. At school slappin on the girls asses
Fuck the white education so I skip a lot of classes
Cause ain't no teaching a nigga white reality
Teach me the mutherfuckin gang mentality
Pop pop pop, drops the sucker
If he's from another hood I gots ta shoot the mutherfucker
Chyeah I'm in it to win it and can't quit
Fool, and ready die for this shit
One times can't fade the gang tuff
Putting my foot in your ass to make times rough
I'm the neighborhood terror but I never wondered
That the hood would take me under

[Hook:]
Always strapped and eager to peel a cap
The hood done took me under
Police is hot, so I'm watching my back...

I guess I'll watch my back cause niggas jivin'
Times heard this brother pulled a 187
Who I thought was my homie dropped the dime
So I gotta peel his cap with the nine
Fool, so if its on then its on, fuck ya G
Because how the odds are looking, its either him or me
So I loads up the strap and I step
Cause my brain cells are dead and all I think is death
Revenge. Chyeah, that's what its all about
See the sucker, take the mutherfucker out
Stare the fool down with the eye contact
He try to swing so I draw on him with the gatt
Blast was the sound that one times heard uh
Nigga 25 to live for the murder
Was it worth it I've always wondered
Maybe if the hood didn't take me under

Chyeah, this going out to all the niggas
It's going out to my niggas
Its going out to all the niggas

Black Pearl, Precious little girl
Let me lift you up where you belong

(Verse 1)
Comin at'cha, can you feel what I'm feelin'
Some soul sister need some natural healing
Gifted but shifted, so come follow me
Cause I'mma take you on a sister to sister journey
Run to get mine, better get 'fore they grab it
Like cold pepsi-cola, gotta say I gots-ta have it
Stayin back too long, when you really got it goin' on
It ain't nothing wrong with being strong, but you don't hear me though

(Chorus)
Black Pearl, Precious little girl
Let me lift you up where you belong
Black Pearl, Precious little girl
You've been in the background much too long

(Verse 2)
Now, all my sisters with the bangles, tryin' on earings
Tryin shopping with the Fendi's and ain't got a penny
High school drop-out, only sixteen like she don't know no better
Don't think it's a crime, cause nobody's there to tell her
Life is scarce, if you don't take a chance you're losin honey
The streets'll be the only place you make your money
Let's get it together, that's the price you have to pay
And if you live for the streets you'll see a better day
One nation, under the groove, we got it open
If we'd just learn to stick together, you know what I mean?
Stop killin' each other, learn to love each other
For the sake of a mother and a brother
Run to get mine, better get 'fore they grab it
Like cold pepsi-cola, gotta say I gots-ta have it
Stayin back too long, when you really got it goin' on
It ain't nothing wrong with being strong, but you don't hear me though

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
What I'm kickin ain't no joke, you better listen up
Black black pressure, and pretty black pearl
Yeah, I done been around the world and it's still all the same
Everybody's still got a little shame in they game
Scared to admit, well here's something you can lean on
Hum the chorus to this song...
It's a lot of strings attched don't let him play you like a buppy
You gotta stay above it or your just like the rest of 'em
Following some dry-ass dream, scared to move on and be more than you friends
Self-motivation, for your self-motivate set the two
Black Pearl's dedicated from Yo to you
Run to get mine, better get 'fore they grab it
Like cold pepsi-cola, gotta say I gots-ta have it
Stayin back too long, when you really got it goin' on
Now tell me what's wrong with being strong

I don't wanna grow up cuz I'm a True Fuschnick
We got a million styles that we compile

So sit, Buddah, sit what lyrical styles should we kick?

[Verse 1: Chip Fu]
I'm a rowdy roddidy piper I flash my dread sherlock Holmes
The thicker the richer the bigger the dread
So I don't need no honeycomb
So eeney, meeney, miney, mo good goobelly goo I bumped my toe
Oh-oh, ""oh-oh better get Maaco"" chocolate Chip's about to flow
The super the cola the fraja the listic expialadope Chip
When the mic is gripped in ridobidobip bip da be bong de dang, bo!
Cause worries and botherations when I wraps it up again and again
But not with the same few styles, I'm wicked and wild and versatile
When the mic is gripped by Chip you better believe it's worth your while
Pause for the cause stop make way hurry up
Here I come come come
My lyrical styles are not to ifos nos in other words
They're not soft son rocks it rigade raggamuffin say it backwards
Aggarniffum so abra Fu alacazam run come follow me man
Put it by one phenomenon huminahumina I'm not done
Me-oh-me oh my hello hello hi
I'm not Huckleberry Finn I'm still speaking, shoo, fly
Don't bother I
So Fe hello hifi Fu fo, make shapes of play-dough re mi
Near far then I will sip yo Lipton Tea bo Tae Kwon Do
Lyrics are bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling
Bubbling,*bubbling,*bubbling,*bubbling,*bubbling,*bubbling,*bubbling
Bubbling til' they're boiled
So don't drink the milk, Why? Cause it's rotten in other words it's
Spoiled
So don't say drats, drats double or triple, quadruple drats
Me big and me black and me hot up de spot G jumping Jehosphats
Some MC's rhymes ain't jack or Jill

So peace to this Fu, peace to that Fu
And a true Fu, Poc Fu, is what I dub you

[Verse 2: Poc Fu]
Rock n' roll, rock'n roll!
What's up with hip-hop, reggae, let's kick some soul
I'll be a braveman like Captain Caveman
Unga bunga, yapple-daple
Oh, snap! Holy batfu, it's an apple
The capital P.O.C. is on a fliptop so hip, hip hooray
Move out my way
Check out what I cockadoodle doo
See it's true I needed psychiatric help
When I was small I had ""Poc-Fu"" on my nameplate belt
Then at last suffering succotash I waste no more time
Used my noodle yankee doodle came up with a rhyme
That was wild, bugged, delirious, looney
Damn! it's hittin' hard
That's word to Gerry Cooney
Knocking heads off shoulders rippin' em clean
You can even ask Idi (WHY?) He know what I mean
Cuz I'm a

Moc's on wax grip, this ain't no demo
Don't even try to flex or uck-fay with my
Mental contender, Apollo
Time for training, jack
Agenda. The M.O. also the Asian Mack
In fact I will attract, shock shit, a True Fuschnick
Classified as I crop to the crip
Not a gimmick to the limit, upset, confused
You gotta vomit
From the excess food called waste
But a taste of oriental True Fu
No haste as I pace
Gogoo gogoo, nanoo-nanoo
Styles that'll have you becomin' a Fuschnick too
Psyche!
Wait a minute, you thought that I was finished
Beginnin' in a hum endin' in a beat drum
Beat?
You like it, it's comin' from the Tribe, side by side
Third stage is the Moc
Unifying lyrics until my tongue drops
Considered as an mc klepto
Techniques could be beat, you think so?
Hell, no!
Romp and rage upon the scene like a lyrical
Ninja master
Crazy zany voiced out styles
That had ya in a dimension as I mentioned
A True Fu steppin'
All attention to the Micken
Styles that I am kickin', whippin', flexin, never flippin
Asian that is hittin' hard until my cup runneth over
Like a boulder never told ya
The M.O. was in control of
Oriental styles to compile or get with
Fiend as I hold the mic with a tight grip
Slipped!
Ha, ha, ha!
That's what you get when you mess around with a True Fuschnick

I'm a True, what? I am a True Fuschnick (Repeat 3X)

Punks jump up to get beat down!
(""Get nothin' but abuse..."")

[Verse 1 – Sadat X]
One day when I was ridin' on the train I seen these two kids talkin'
About the Nubian reign had fallen
I didn't say nothin' cuz these kids caught my goat
Even wore my coat like a murder that they wrote
So this kid with mouth swagger 'n I'll blaze the cloak and dagger
So I gotta show Dukes the macho lot that I am
I can rock a jam, make the world drop ham
Oh yes, I'm the bad man, and bad men wear black
And if it comes to droppin' bombs, yo, I'm with that
Though I can freak, fly, floow, fuck up a faggot
Don't understand their ways I ain't down with gays
You wanna grab the style that was made from my mom and my dad
When I was young I used to run with a notepad
Then time flew and somehow I knew that I was bad to the bone...
Black prodigy since the age of twen-ty
I could write a rhyme, rip it up and write a next one
Right on the spot, sign my name with a dot
Diamond D threw me some smooth shit, Bronx crowd roar
Stick up your wack jam, everybody hit the floor
Okay it's you, Slim, the hard rock of the pack
Don't wanna kneel to the brothers, you must be holin'
Bust some shit in his chest, now his whole body's swollen
Why did I have to do it? He asked for it
His man saw it, so it don't mean shit to me
He's gone, that's how it's supposed to be....check it out now
I ain't goin' out, man that short shit is dead
Have you heard what I said? If not, ask the dread
He got a cannon that's bad...similar to the one that I got from my own dad

Refrain 4x

[Verse 2 – Lord Jamar]
Your punk ass'll be grass quick fast like my name was Flash
When a nigga try and rob me for my cash
You thought you had a sweet vic, a nice pick
But you didn't anticipate that I might be sick
Now who's the trick, cuz I'm not a ho. (No, no-no-no!)
I always do the fuckin', just might do the buckin'
I leave my Nikes stuck in your rectum, till you learn
Brand Nubian, yo, you gotta respect 'em
Dissect 'em, yo, our word is bond regardless
To my what, and do the Puma strut
So step the fuck off, before I punch you in your face
With the mothafuckin' bass!
Then you're gonna taste blood in your mouth, it's gonna flood south
To the ground, and you're gonna know I don't fuck around
So if you think you had two soft newjacks
We're gonna have top off you with a few cracks
To the jaw and you won't pop that shit no more
Explainin' to your friends why you're layin' on the floor
Did you want some more? I didn't think so
Just got whipped like a faggot in the clink, so
I suggest you take your bloody mess and find a piece of wire
Fix your broken jaw, then it's time to retire
Lord Jamar will live long, cuz I give strong blows the heads of my foes
Dread flows, gives me power as it grows
Watch how rass-cladda you catch the speed knot
Heed not, and hell will be your home
Lord Jamar, Sadat, as we swell your dome

[Verse 1]
Casualties of war; as I approach the barricade
Where's the enemy? Who do I invade?
Bullets of Teflon, bulletproof vest rip
Tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips
Cause I got a family that waits for my return
To get back home is my main concern
I'ma get back to New York in one piece
But I'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets
Sky lights up like fireworks blind me
Bullets, whistlin' over my head remind me
President Bush said attack
Flashback to Nam, I might not make it back
Missile hits the area, screams wake me up
From a war of dreams, heat up the M-16
Basic training, trained for torture
Take no prisoners, and I just caught ya
Addicted to murder, send more body bags
They can't identify em, leave the name tags
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor
Causalities of war

Causalities of war
Causalities of war

It's all hard work and no play
More than combat, it's far beyond that
Cause I got a kill or be killed kind of attack
Area's mapped out, there'll be no, Stratego
Me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go
But what are we here for? Who's on the other side of the wall?
Somebody give the President a call
But I hear warfare scream through the air
Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare
A Desert Storm: let's see who reigns supreme
Something like Monopoly: a government scheme
Go to the Army, be all you can be
Another dead soldier? Hell no, not me
So I start letting off ammunition in every direction
Allah is my only protection
But wait a minute, Saddam Hussein prays the same
And this is Asia, from where I came
I'm on the wrong side, so change the target
Shooting at the general; and where's the sergeant?
Blame it on John Hardy Hawkins for bringing me to America
Now it's mass hysteria
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor
Causalities of war

[Hook]
Causalities of war
Causalities of war
Causalities of war

[Verse 3]
The war is over, for now at least
Just because they lost it don't mean it's peace
It's a long way home, it's a lot to think about
Whole generation, left in doubt
Innocent families killed in the midst
It'll be more dead people after this
So I'm glad to be alive and walkin'
Half of my platoon came home in coffin
Except the general, buried in the Storm
In bits and pieces no need to look for em
I played it slick and got away with it
Rigged it up so they would think they did it
Now I'm home on reserves and you can bet
When THEY call, I'm going AWOL
Cause it ain't no way I'm going back to war
When I don't know who or what I'm fighting for
So I wait for terrorists to attack
Every time a truck backfires I fire back
I look for shelter when a plane is over me
Remember Pearl Harbor? New York could be over, G
Kamikaze, strapped with bombs
No peace in the East, they want revenge for Saddam
Did I hear gunshots, or thunder?
No time to wonder, somebody's going under
Put on my fatigues and my camouflage
Take control, cause I'm in charge
When I snapped out of it, it was blood, dead bodies on the floor
Causalities of war

[Hook]
Causalities of war
Causalities of war

430,4047,Too $hort,In The Trunk,23,1992-12-05,"

It's on
Where they at, where they at, where they at

I sold tapes every day me and Freddy B
Been famous since 1983
Give me ten dollars, and you straight get blessed
A rap all about you called the special request
Oakland, you know I go way back
To Cougnuts, fast Stangs, and Cadillacs
When homeboys put Vogues on any car
With 6 by 9's smoking burners
Everybody got addicted to my dopefiend beat
Whole town fucked around and started smoking D
Every rap I ever made was about this town
I made 7 whole albums with no James Brown
And even though I love his music, I just can't stand
The way they used it all up and didn't pay the man
And after 2 platinum albums, you call me weak
Cause I don't sell records in the East
Now what's funky, I say pussy on an old ho
I guess y'all fools don't know
Why some good rappers can't sell no tapes
It's not the company's fault, the shit sounds fake
You wanna be in the trunk, with the booming box
While the young bitches ride on your jock
You can't do it like this homey, so just pass it
And stop kissing them white folks' asses
It's like you smoked a whole damn key
You rap so fast you keep leaving the beat
I'm from the old school, I love P-Funk
But now rap music is all that they want
So when I'm in my car, I play Clinton
And when I'm on the stage I start pimping
And when I hear your shit, I push eject
Then I throw it out the window with the rejects
And when the hard core rappers go soft
I like to watch when they ass fall off
Cause ain't nothing worth kicking like a sucka MC
And any other rappers ever talk about me
I don't stop rapping, that's all they can say
And how I dogg bitches, every day
But if you can't be a dogg, then you're weak
You be phony like a side show freak
Some rappers try to come off positive
Where I'm from that just ain't how it is
They say rap music is here to stay
But the sucka MC's don't think that way
It took 8 long years before I got my break
So I wonder why rappers make fake ass tapes
You won't get paid like I did, so give up punk
And while you're in the studio, I'm in the trunk
You got no choice, so don't flip that coin
This ain't the military, so you punks can't join
It ain't pop, it's called underground rap
From Oakland California and the shit sounds phat
I'm spitting raps to my motherfucking homies
That's why they listen to the one and only
I used to be broke, but now we all used to be
Got no game for a bitch, all the game is for me
And these bitches, can't say shit to me
They could never could fuck with Short baby
I'm not a tounge twisting rapper with a funny style
Don't dress hip hop and dance real wild
But I do sell records like a motherfucker
Even though you might I'm just another sucka
I find the beat and then never switch
Grab the microphone and then call you a bitch
You want rent money, I got pimp money
One thing's for sure, I won't give it to a ho
I throw a bitch in the God damn trunk
And start slamming that Oakland funk
Short Dogg's in the house, once again
Trying to fade the platinum, with Shorty the Pimp
And when I do, I'm going straight to the bank
Withdraw some money and buy some dank
You can't relate to my motherfucking homies
That's why they listen to the one and only
I grew up on the funk called P
But these motherfuckers growing up on me
And if I ego trip, and my head is fucked
I take my ass back, to where I grew up
And get real boy, it's never too late
Before I do like you and make a weak ass tape
I'm in the trunk...

In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk beating down the block

In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk, in, in the trunk
In the trunk beating down the block

I was in my room writing rhymes I H-A-D had
Next to my room was a laboratory run by my D-A-D dad
He was a professor, and I'm his S-O-N
So my life as a professor had just begun, my name is
K-E-V-I-N-M-A-D-I-S-O-N run the experiment I qualify
And become a good professor in medicine
I ran out my door, and I looked for
A breakbeat, spelling book, and grabbed my dog, ""Woof!""
Rhymes that I had, every muscle from his body
The combination of that will give me strength, to rock a party
I thought that I might, get H-U-R-T hurt
If I used dad's melachalonin machine that was known to convert
No manual that I could find on dad's machine
I hit a button and this rumor turned the laboratory green
Some hairs was from my dog and a pair from mine
Hit the switch I spelled a rhyme the chromosome, will mix with mine
This uncanny combination will let the world understand

Ka-rank the boombox as my sound knock from blocks
As I chill, and bust grills you take snapshots
Of the maniac, dressed in black, alright I'm strapped
Kid you play me too close (slow down and catch a cap, POW!!)
Cause I don't play games, an outlaw like Jesse James
To hell with the bitches and the so-called fame (uh-huh)
Strictly biz to hard (kid yeah) as I climb charts
Bustin heads daily as I compose like Mozart
Just stand, say you're mad damn, why him?
ZL1 Targa, five-sixty Benz
I'm sinking mad deep no shorts and no sleep
I'm bugged like a tapped phone, hard like concrete
So get a GRIP and don't SLIP or catch a CLIP
From the infrared aimed at your head as I blast my TARGET
The Bozack, I rip up flows that
Make an MC stop and chill and say HE'S ALL THAT
Hardcore no R&B singer
Roll with the Hit Squad... down with the head banger

[Verse 2: Erick Sermon]
SURPRISE, you wonder where I've been, I've been workin
But sounds makin danger, and black birds chirpin
A real Damian, Omen possessed by the devil
You dig the rhythm, and I'll play the RUNNIN REBEL
Changed my style, so I can freak the funk
Yo pass the Philly, HIT SQUAD spark the blunt
I got the power, to ramshack a stadium
WUBBA WUBBA, even Julie Brown at the Palladium
Yo, I'm from the Boondocks so I knows the flavor (yeah, yeah)
Sometimes I curse but now, I show behavior
EPMD, YO, is in this to win this
A brand new LP SO MIND YOUR BUSINESS
No jokin, I'm gettin paid fully
You wanna buy the cassette? Stop by Sam Goody
YO WHERE'S MY HOODIE? I wanna be hard and cause some ruckus
Talk with the b-boy slang and blast some suckers
Walk like an Egyptian, but packin' my steel
Plus I'm goin to court, make my own appeal
As taught as a kid or told, NEVER TALK TO A STRANGER
Cause I could be a head banger

[Hook]

[Verse 3: K-Solo]

So back up off me, here's a clip
For uzis and guns, and then you faggots gonna OFF ME

I knock punks out quick like Evander Holyfield
More rhymes than music's, my solution
Subscribers of my style here's a contribution
Let's say you want a shovel layer parkin MC's like cars
And drivin MC's away
Tanks gon be full, to rappers wanna tempt me
I break the steer shift and leave em EMPTY
Cause they can't go, so I'mma call a ho tow truck
To come tow truck your weak SIDE SHOW
Back on the scene is the incredible one man team

Cause I move slow, I get my cash flow, and then I go
And brother's don't know, I'm on the down low
Some get mad cause they can't understand
That I'm 23 years old, I'm in command
I'm down with DITC, that's ""Diggin' in the Crates""
And my partner A.G., we always keep crazy papes
I'm staying fat, cause what comes around goes around
I always help out and help a brother when he's down
And out like a boy scout, brothers always shout
""Good lookin' out Show"" Yeah, without a doubt
But don't try and take advantage
I'll just leave you alone instead of putting that ass in bandages

In the mental, in other words can I get a soul clap?
Diggin' in the crates for something smooth
Showbiz & A.G., yo money, we make the party groove
And I'm a top-notch competitor
Carrying dough like a treasurer
Getting pussy, oh that's regular
But the sex I never take
Cause if that bitch screams rape
Like Mike Tyson, I'm upstate
And you know that's a fact, black
So if she says no, that means no, and that's that
No matter how cute or how desperate
(Ayo she gotta get the boot)
Yeah, she gotta see the exit
But I'm not mad I didn't hit it
I just dial seven digits and some skins that's with it
Bones in the closet, that's my logic
You gotta be smart and keep a down low in the projects
Watch your step and take it easy
Or act like Stevie Wonder because you know you can't see me
Don't sniff no coke, but I might drink a brew
Or maybe two (Andre the Giant, not you)
Yeah, wrecking MCs with just my demo
And pulling all the cuties with no problemo
That's right, because I'm a gamer
Your girl let you for me, A.G., I don't blame her
Step back, get your sticks and your bats
Know you step up because my pockets are fat

[Refrain]
""I like my pockets fat not flat"" (repeat 3x)

[Verse Three: Showbiz]
It's time to take the brothers from the corner
Clean up they act, and give them a chance to do what the wanna
I'm not trying to be a bum with a 40
That's not my style, I gotta work hard like Naughty
By Nature, you should understand
To get yours in this land, you gotta work for yours, black man
You think it's easy because I rap?
So don't ask me for a dollar motherfucker, you ain't handicapped
And if you was, you'd still have the chance
Look how I flip ""ain't this a bitch"" now I'm making you dance
Yeah it's Show B-I-Z from your neighbor H-double-O-D, I R-A-P
Cause I wanna stay fat
To keep clothes on my back and you know I never slack
For all the bums that said I forgot where I came from
Eating crumbs on the corner in the slums
I'm hungry enough to grow fangs
Here's a dollar, go to the store
But give me back my fucking change
I'm not trying to spend on so-called friends
Not even with skins, put that bullshit to an end
So fuck the groupies on tour
I'm trying to make a million dollars, some shit I never saw before
So save that bullshit for later
So when I'm large, hoes give me head on an escalator
Yeah, I like to flow, I'm Show B-I-Z

Sweet tasting chocolate all the way through
I'd lick you slow from head to toe…

My ice cream
Yeah, my ice cream dream
Just the way I like it

[Verse 1]
Sweet dreams, from this don't wake me
You couldn't even if you tried to shake me
What do ya want ‘cause I’m in a deep sleep
No nightmare here, dear, I’m talking chocolate treat
Slick and slippery, thick it’s gotta be
It’s mandatory that I make him a part of me
I'll make the dream last ‘cause it seems
I can only have him, in my ice cream dream

[Hook: Lisa Keith]
Smooth and rich, it’s so true of us
Dreams of you, me in a...
Ice cream dream
Take a scoop, it's so tasty
Don't keep me waiting
Ice cream dream

[Verse 2]
Sweet as candy, a physique for show
I’mma let him know we can go toe for toe
Hip to hip, lip to lip, and then lock it
Big fat feet means big fat pockets
Trick or treat, tasty like pastry
Hmm, I wonder has he had any lately
Ready to hit it if you know what I mean
‘Cause homie seems to be like an ice cream dream

[Hook]
Smooth and rich, it’s so true of us
Dreams of you, me in a...
Ice cream dream
Take a scoop, it's so tasty
Don't keep me waiting
Ice cream dream

Dark, handsome, six feet tall
31 flavors, I believe he’s got ‘em all
Slippin’ and slidin’ and oozin’ down the cone
Hope he doesn’t melt before I get him home
Drip drop, come on, feed me, Seymour
Take some now, I know later there’ll be more
We got the best, it seems you’re the king
You’re the man in the picture of my ice cream dream

Goody, goody
Yeah
Uh huh
Mmm…

[Verse 4]
Smooth and rich, he’s looking real nice
Cool as ice, but then again, not quite
This kind of honey is the type I like looking at
He could scoop me up twice ‘cause he’s all that
So I’mma ease up, no time to waste
Forget the chase, I’m prepared to get a taste
Licky here, licky there ‘cause I like it
Too much to eat so I guess I’ll…bite it

Goody, goody; goody, goody
Yeah
He’s my ice cream dream

She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthought-of dimensions
Why's it so fly cause hip-hop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light blue-suede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin' chunky rhythms right down ya block
We be to rap what key be to lock

But
I'm cool like dat [x7]
I'm cool...I'm cool..

[Ladybug]
We be the chocolates taps on my raps
She innovates at the sweetest cat naps
He at the funk club with the vibrate
Them they be crazy down with the five plate
It can kick a plan then a crowd burst
Me I be digging it with a bump verse
Us we be freaking til dawn blinks an eye
He gives the strangest smile so I say hi (wassup)
Who understood, yeah understood the plan
Him heard a beat and put it to his hands
What I just flip let borders get loose
How to consume or they'll be just like juice
If its the shit we'll lift it off the plastic
The babes'll go spastic, Hip hop gains a classic
Pimp playing shock it don't matter I'm fatter
Ask Butta how I zone (man Cleopatra Jones)

And
I'm chill like dat [x7]
I'm chill...I'm chill...

[All]

Blink..blink..blink..blink..blink..blink..blink....
Think..think..think..think..think..think..think...

[Doodlebug]
We getcha free cause the clips be fat boss
Them they're the jams and commence to going off
She sweats the beat and ask me cause she puffed it
Me I got crew kids seven and a crescent
Us cause a buzz when the nickel bags are dealt
Him, that's my man with the asteroid belt
They catch a fizz from the Mr. Doodle-big
He rocks a tee from the Crooklyn nine-pigs
The rebirth of slick like my gangsta stroll
The lyrics just like loot come in stacks and rolls
You used to find a Bug in a box with fade
Now he boogies up your stage plaits twist or braids

And
I'm peace like dat [x7]
I'm Peace

[Butterfly]
Check it out man I groove like dat
I'm smooth like dat
I jive like dat
I roll like dat

[Ladybug]
Yeah I'm thick like dat

Well yo I funk like dat

Cause I swing like dat

We jazz like dat
We freak like dat
We zoom like dat
We out...we out...

Rough me up and I can't do a thing
Pick up my line when my telephone ring

Trail me down cause I'm hanging with the Snowman
What I'm gonna do? I'm backed and I'm trapped
Slap me in the face and took all of my gap

(Chorus)

Tap the bottle and twist the cap
Tap the bottle and twist the cap
Tap the bottle and twist the cap
And pass it around the crew be cause the crew be all that

Hey yo, hickory dickory dock I'm under the Brooklyn block yes
Who's the next to testify and try and penetrate the vest
Diggatie do-re-me-fa-so-la-ti-do I drop back my ballzac
I take it in track and give it a smack and cuttin no slack, jack
Okay here I go Shorty tap the forty O smash
To a pass, if ya crash make a dash to the trash
Tap a cap, have a lot and not a lot not a little
Don't grade upon the label take a guzzle, don't dribble
I got the supercalafragileisticexpialadou-cious
You're commin to close to this, I get fero-cious
Coax this rhyme, smoke this rhyme hype
When we rock it up on the mic, we rock the mic right
Pass the funnel to the tunnel like it's busy till I'm dizzy
Never pass it to get fizzy cause the guard gets busy who is he?
Damn just pass the code decipher when I hit the dress bottom buy a can of
Red Stripe

Chorus (Repeat 1x)

Well I be commin' around the mountain with my ho Suzanna
I'm peelin off the caps like the hicks in Alabama
Check the grammar and the stamina I'm tootin' on my horn
Timberland boot stompin' forty drink it more
Malt liquor chug a filter let me rip it then I kick it
Tap it once for my brothers sip it then I sip it
So Xerox the zip code I'm in them all perfect-o
Halleluiah here I go watch me flow and let go
Trouble shooter smoke the buddah rule like a dictator
Used to hit the fader now I play the commentator
So let me swing it from the rhyme to the concrete jungle
With the king heir's mackin, rulin' over knuckle
Hits to the bed, cause Right Said Fred
Lock em up with the bee's wax, kick it to em dred
Yo, pass the peas please party pooper party stops
64 will give ya more if ya scammin on the block
Red top red top bust open till ya stop
But if you're drinkin too slow you might kiss the steel toe
Just keep the sud from movin' everything's be fine
And the forty's stops here till I finish my rhyme

Chorus (Repeat 2x)

Balance on the beam, here we go team, hike!
Pass the mic down the line on time drop the rhyme
I rope a Rope-a-dope smokin with the red beam scopin'
Pull a magnum body back and leave a back bone broken
So was a bend a trend I'm sendin and I'm cruisin' for a hit
When I'm just sittin' in the outhouse droppin mad shhhhhhhh
Quiet on the set while the crew be gettin' wrecked
And if your stunned by the bunch I have a hunch you should step
So pass me the crazy straw and let me do the Q-Tip
What is a forty if I can't take a sip?
Sometimes I drive slow sometimes I drive fast
Sometimes I'm on E sometimes I get gas
So check the stress sure to step to the left
With the no E tap on the top pass it back
Give a tap to the child, pass it, sorry, keep it goin
Down my throat I keep it flowin, styles keep growin'
We don't brown bag it, the label be showin'
And we don't give a damn if the hoes be knowin'
From the drip to my lip I like to pass it with a grip
Shorty-Dog is in the cypher, so you better not skip

Chorus (Repeat 2x)

[Hook: Apache]
I need a gangsta bitch (a gangsta bitch)
I want a gangsta bitch yo (a gangsta bitch)
I wanna ""Gangsta boogie!"" with my (gangsta bitch)
I want a (gangsta bitch) I need a (gangsta bitch)
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 1]
Yo, I need a gangsta bitch; she don't sleep and she don't play
Stickin up girls from around the fuckin way
Strapped but lovable, hateful but huggable
Always in trouble and definitely fuckable
See her now, booms and pounds, she's mine friend
Puffin on a blunt, sippin on a Heineken
She's got charm, a firearm to match mine
Going to the movies packin' his-and-her nines
Wearin Carhartt and leather, motherfuck the weather
On Valentine's Day, doin stick-ups together
No one to blame, no shame in her game
And when we fuck she makes me scream out her name
She's not petty; confident, ready
Right for late night, we play fight with machetes.
This goes out to all the gangsta ho pros:
Give me a ghetto girl, fuck a Soul Train ho

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She likes to party with her posse and drink beer
Pour a little bit out for the sisters who ain't here
She's not the one, player you might get done
Her idea of fun's takin her son shoppin for a gun
Likes to dress to impress, quick to attack
When your punk-ass boys run, you know she's got your back
In a Benz with her friends, AMG kit
Drivin down the street pumpin, ""Apache you ain't shit!""
Snappin on niggas, takin no shorts
Sittin on a porch, pullin on a Newport
Minds her business, knows 'cause she hears things
Fat herringbone and diamond studded earrings
She's a thoroughbred, walks and talks with class
Try to get fast, she just might slap your ass
Come meet my moms, but the two might not click
Parents just don't understand...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I had a church girl, quiet girl, one girl was rich
The most memorable girl was a gangsta bitch
We went out a lot, sometimes we dressed the same
Lickin shots in the park and had pet names
I called her 'Dollars' 'cause that's what she liked to spend
She called me 'Diamond' cause my dick was her best friend
If you owed her dough, then you had to pay
Bought her an AK for her 21st birthday
We packed up and shacked up, didn't need a job
Engaged to a criminal and married to the mob
I gave MCs injuries and beat 'em down
While she's, pickin up ki's, from Uptown
Sad to say one day got caught out there
I shed a tear when the judge said five years
She's gone now so it's time to make my switch
So who'll be my next gangsta bitch?

[Verse 1 - Arrested Development]
Here, have a dollar
In fact, no brotherman - here, have two
Two dollars means a snack for me
But it means a big deal to you
Be strong, serve God only
Know that if you do, beautiful heaven awaits
That's the poem I wrote for the first time
I saw a man with no clothes, no money, no plate
Mr.Wendal, that's his name
No one ever knew his name cause he's a no-one
Never thought twice about spending on a ol' bum
Until I had the chance to really get to know one
Now that I know him, to give him money isn't charity
He gives me some knowledge, I buy him some shoes
And to think blacks spend all that money on big colleges
Still most of y'all come out confused

[Hook - Arrested Development]
Go ahead, Mr.Wendal
Go ahead, Mr.Wendal

[Verse 2 - Arrested Development]
Mr.Wendal has freedom
A free that you and I think is dumb
Free to be without the worries of a quick to diss society
For Mr.Wendal's a bum
His only worries are sickness
And an occasional harassment by the police and their chase
Uncivilized we call him
But I just saw him eat off the food we waste
Civilization, are we really civilized, yes or no
Who are we to judge
When thousands of innocent men could be brutally enslaved
And killed over a racist grudge
Mr. Wendal has tried to warn us about our ways
But we don't hear him talk
Is it his fault when we've gone too far
And we got too far, cause on him we walk
Mr. Wendal, a man, a human in flesh
But not by law
I feed you dignity to stand with pride
Realize that all in all you stand tall

Freedom is a road seldom traveled by...

[Verse 1: J-Dee]
An AK talks, but bullshit runs
I wish I had time, to count all my guns
Cause a nigga is runnin' out of funds
But H. Rap says ""Freedom got a strap!""
[I wish I was in dixie, A.K., A.K
Then shit wouldn't have been bad in the sixties
No way No way]
I, can't see the OG's standin' in big lines
Holdin' big signs, tryin' to get mine
[I'll shoot ya ass 17 times]
Cause this week we don't turn the other cheek
Do that shit and get stole on
Non-violence gotta roll on, plus we got a hold on
The mayor of the whole fuckin city
Saw the Lench Mob and his drawers got shitty
So get the fuck out my way when I say
Hey - freedom got an A.K

[Hook]
A to the K to the 4 to the 7
Little devils don't got to heaven [ repeat ]
(Freedom is a road seldom traveled by the multitude . . . )

[Verse 2: J-Dee]
Used to be a buck masta, buck mast-er
Or sit back and get fucked faster
Than a horny-assed rabbit, [dagnabbit, cause I gotta have it]
[Shoot 'em up Shoot 'em up, ah yeah
Talkin' like that'll have 'em all scared]
Don't come to me wit no petition
[Fool come to me wit ammunition!]
Cause the bang-bang, buck-buck, boom-boom, pow-pow
Used to be a trick [but bitch - how ya like me know]
Cause the Ak-40 dick hold a 50 clip
And I'll shoot till it's empty bitch
That's how you got filthy rich
I know the game, so I'mma do the same
Don't like when I play the same way
And say - hey - freedom's got an AK

[Hook]

[Verse 3: J-Dee]
You better call nine one one
The nigga's got a gun, and he's gonna have fun
An Ak-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a mutherfuckin' fool
Cause I'll have to run around and point
And fuck around and have to shoot the whole fuckin joint
A is for apple, K is for killin
I'm killin - 47 million civilians
So if you wanna jump your ass in, come on -
I'm buckin and blastin'
The L to the E to the N to the C to the H to the M to the O to the B
And you'll see
One dead devil - kick that shit to the level
Here's my shovel, cause I don't play

Yo, this is how I'm comin' for the nine deuce
Another phat, phat track, so Rhythm D, pour the orange juice
And let's relax while sippin' on 'gnac because it's like that
I'm cautious of hoes, so Paperboy wears prophylactic
I wear a jimmy for the skinny that's in the long trench
Front row seats, so yo I know she's on the nine inch
Just to get a piece of the green, but she's an undertaker
Not knowin' the paper is a 'round the world heart-breaker
Many say I front, but yo, had to have a break down
Playin' you fools, so now you know why my belly's round
Takin' the rap back up and scoopin' up crowds just like a steel shovel
Not from the ghetto, but yo, take me to another level
Let the beat ride, but hold on to your woman, G
'Cause now that I'm rich so many women wanna do me
It make a man say 'damn'
I'm finally taxin' more than your homey Sam
But let me speak to the weak, I mean the rookies
My time is held up, extremely for cookies
Just let me clock this grip in ninety-two
And you don't bother me and I sure 'nuff won't bother you
And uh, you just watch a brother flowin' like Niagara
Think before you step, because these lyrics just might stag ya
Although I'm labeled with the black fade
It's gold D's on my four and gold 'lex, 'cause I got it made
I broke the veto once again because I had to
And just like Jody Watley, baby girl, I can have you
Just let me work this track, and yo, any way is OK
Your place or mine, all night until the next day, huh

[Chorus]
Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

Now here we go from the top, second verse of the same song
With the conclusion, hoes should be happy for the ding-dong
And since a man clock a grip, G
It's like every nigga that I see be like, 'Do you remember me?'
A hustler, and it's known with more hoes than Lego
Keep 'em chunky like Prego, so niggas leggo my Eggo
I have a tendency to flow, start off with my own groove
And pick up the mic, and all of a sudden, I see high movin'
Guess it's like magic, and Paperboy is the magician
If I was a vacuum I'd be suckin' up competition
Let it ride again, and yo, believe I got my own thing
Straight Bahama hoes so miss me with a chick from Soul Train
And I'm a break my note, just to show up tokin'
So hide his eyes when I scoop him, 'cause we bud smokin'
A black man tryin' to make it and that ain't no fair
But just like BeBe and CeCe, I'll take you there, huh

[Chorus]
Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

Now here we go, uh, let's take a trip to another land
Clock a grip, come back and watch the hoes tan
Jump in the Lex-o, and roll out to my cabin
Believe me my brother, more hoes than you can imagine
All on the ding-a-ling, just because the gold rings
But I'm like 'What's up with ya? You ain't heard a damn thing'
Make sure you got the jim hats, strapped for protection
Because to me, my life is more than my erection
And give me a hand, if you a fan, it ain't over yet
'Cause doin' the Ditty with Paperboy makes the ocean sweat
Kick the kind of style that knock the funk off of Fritos
Make you man jealous while hoes cheese like Doritos
It ain't my fault, I lay the pipe with concern-and
I ain't from Mount Vernon, but a brother's money-earnin'
And don't disagree and then jock, that's a pity
Just bob your head for Paperboy and the Ditty
Yeah

[Chorus]
Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
To do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
To do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

[Produced by Dr. Dre]

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance, so back on up
(‘Cause you know we're about to rip shit up)
Give me the microphone first so I can bust, like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together
Now you know you're in trouble
Ain't nothing but a G thang, baby
Two loc'ed out niggas, so we're crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earning her man
And learning her man, and at the same time burning her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

[Hook: Dr. Dre + Snoop Dogg]
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Dre, creep to the mic, like a phantom
Well, I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creepin'
But I damn near got caught, ‘cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection symbolizes dope
Take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
On what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

[Hook: Dr. Dre + Snoop Dogg]
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?
So just chill 'til the next episode

[Refrain: Kid Dynamite + Public Enemy (Congress Alley)]
You’ve got the feeling
To rock the other side
You’ve got the feeling (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Falling back on that ass, with a hellafied gangsta lean
Getting funky on the mic, like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes, I'm fresh, N double-O, P
D, O, double-G, Y, D, O, double-G, you see
Showing much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimping hoes and clocking a grip, like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some mothafuckin' G shit
(Hell yeah) So Dre (What's up, Dogg?)
Gotta give them what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton)

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Is where it takes place, so when asked, your attention
Mobbin' like a motherfucker, but I ain't lynchin'
Dropping the funky shit
That's making the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie; they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, ‘cause if I slip then I'm slippin'
But if I got my Nina then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Putting the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better

[Hook: Dr. Dre + Snoop Dogg]
Like this, that and this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?
So just chill 'til the next episode

[Refrain: Kid Dynamite + Public Enemy (Congress Alley)]
You’ve got the feeling
To rock the other side
You’ve got the feeling (Yeah, yeah)
You’ve got the feeling
To rock the other side

Hey...Ho...Hey...Ho...Hey...Ho...Hey...Ho...

[Verse 1: Vinnie]
You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day (Hey!)
I'm rockin' and you're yawning
But you never look my way (Hey!)
I'm licking down your darlin'
In every single way (Hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign
And a green card's on the way
[Verse 1: Treach]
This ain't got shit to do with shampoo, but watch your head n shoulder
Brother older bold enough to fold ya, yo I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made and played it, plus a funky fit
So save your flips and tricks for that music and the monkey bit
[Verse 1: Vinnie]
Triggers from the Grilltown Illtown
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom, ain't trying to be handsome
Shrinking what you're thinking cause I'm vamping
[Verse 1: Treach]
I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop for today
I give props to hip-hop so...
[Hook: Vinnie; Treach]
Hip Hop hooray...

Hip Hop hooray...
Hey...Ho...Hey...Ho...Hey...Ho...Hey...Ho...
[Verse 2: Treach]
You heard a lot about a brother gaining mo' ground
Being low down I do the showdown with any little ho round, no!
I wanna know who you're believing, through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleeping you think I'm cheatin'
You said, ""I know you, Mr. O.P.P. man
Yo PP man, won't only see me man""
You should've known when I ain't hit it and step
That I was wit' it a bit not to consider the rep, heck!
I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker
Cause I'm Naughty by Nature, not cause I hate ya!
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark
You try to act like something really big is missing
Even though my name's graffiti Written on Ya Kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today

Hip Hop hooray...

Hip Hop Hip Hip Hop Hip Hip Hop Hooray!
There's many hungry Hip Hoppers one reason Hip Hop's tip-top today
Swerve what ya heard cause I ain't bailing no hay
Ain't chopping no crops, but still growing every day
[Verse 3: Vinnie]
Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns beat downs are found
Don't know me don't come around
[Verse 3: Treach]
Tippy tippy (pause) tippy tippy (pause)
Sometimes creepin' up I eat em up
Your styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That way I shout out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish, neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitties purr, now call me sir too
Looking for her crew
Any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots, step through troops and leave proof
My problem solver's name is Mook
I hitting woodies in a hoody
Peace to Josette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Genae, and every hood G
That's right, my fight is ill
Peace goes to L.O.N.S. and Quest, Nice & Smooth & Cypress Hill

Verse One: Red Hot Lover Lover Tone

Diggedy da-di-la-di-da-di, baby there's a party
But you can't have a party without a large Bacardu
You got to keep the hottie moving like a Maserati
A hundred million women wanna Tone up their body
And I can never pass up a chance to romance them
Don't call me soft just because I'm handsome
So money take a tip if you flip and you slip
You'll be using all your teeth for poker chips
So wiggedy word wiggedy word I don't smoke the herb
And if my hottie smokes the shit I'll kick her to the curb
Every morning breakfast in bed is served
Cause on women I haev an affect like a quadra verb
So can I whip yes what yes like buddha sess yes
Shot em all dead when they try to test
So keep me in like Flynn this year I'm gonna win
If my balls are on your chin then you got the D.I.Y.M
So can I get a shout
Peace to Chubb Rock, TrakMasters, the Gigalos and I'm out
Yabadabadoo

Verse Two: Chubb Rock

Wow look at the size of his chest
Never the less I jump upon ET list and then phone my home
Before the little kitten throws a stone
The holder of the Rock, one two and ya don't stop
Rhythm to the dism while the ism forms a prism
Suck the dism stand like a Chisolm dimension prison and is he
The One, The One, he says he's the one, the only one
Take the two subtract the one and uh-hhuh
He's handsome ya see, big strong and sturdy
Watch the birdy I'm nerdy on the IQ set
Caught nuff wreck
The grim reapear what said Charlier Brown's damn teacher
Wa wah wah wa wa wah, damn
I cram to understand the plan ma'am
I mean I've been hitting the books for a long time now
Real long time now, look at the furrowed brow
Drink Slim Faster, delete the chow
For a strong sequel word up to the people
The people; you mean power to them
While Eastwood Clint plays misty for the buddha
He's buzzing, cummin at cha
And you know we had to watcha, time for some lyrics
While I kick it and you hear it
Even Helen Keller word up can hear it
From the rustler lyrical hustler
The fat lady sand I crusher her, word up the Chubbster
Yabadabadoo

Verse Three: Rob Swinga

Rob Swinga loves jazz so I'ma swing this like a cool cat
Down with A.T.E.E.M., Trakmasterz got a dope rap
Humongous vocals; I'm quick to flick a jab
I'm not Michael Jackson or the Chubbs but I'm bad
Chew up a sucker like a stick of gum
And then I spit out the bum once the flavor's done
I'm nifty powerful like an M-60
And I'll pop your girl like Jiffy popped Dippy
Well I swing a lyric like a swinga would
And I swing a ho in bed like a swinga should
When it comes to getting hoes I'm rated quadruple X
Just like Dr. Ruth my mind is strictly on the sex
And style or position is my selection
But I won't play without my contraception
Like Ramsey's or Trojan's oh yes that's chill
If worse comes to worse then I use no frills
So check it check it check it check it check it one two

Those who know the time, huh, already knew it
I drink a Snapple and I wet my Adam's apple
And head straight for the center, the dope style inventor
Quick to make a buck, cause it's not beginner's luck
Type of shit that hits, when you pump it in your truck
Not Ashford and Simpson, Ike and Tina Turner
Sonny or Cher, it's somethin dope on your ear
So whether Monday

But it's time for me to jet, so I'ma let Mary end it

[ VERSE 1 ]
I ain't one to gossip, but I heard your shit was wack
And I ain't one to brag, but this jam is fat
I won't push you to the extreme to say I'm all that
But if you have to ask, then you must think that
Don't understand what it means to be conceited
Never left a sentence or a verse incompleted
In a battle I won't get defeated
And I don't get mad, I get heated
Had to wreck the ones that wanted to fight me
Don't give a damn if nobody likes me
Never lit the likes of pipes or hype
I'm livin for me, myself and the mic
Love to rock Nikes and a dope sweat hoodie
You can't buy vinyl at no Sam Goody
Hip-hop DJ's, what will you do
Record companies don't know, when you do, buy two
They're killin hip-hop with ease
And I hate those damn cd's
Now let's talk about the birds and Heather B's
Sisters, don't allow yourself to get skeezed
And believe I got the mad self-respect
So recognize and understand my rep
And if you show me any disrespect
You better know that I get wreck

[ Chorus ]
And I get wreck
(On and on and on and on)	--] Grand Puba
(Ugh! Ugh! Ugh)

[ VERSE 2 ]
I'm not a star, cause I don't shine
I'm a go-getter, cause I will go get mine
I ain't lazy, moody or shady
And I won't lie, but I am crazy
The same way I chill, I will ill
And I wanna beat you cause your ???? need a kill
I got skills and I don't pop pills
And no man can say that I want his diznills
I won't fix anything that's not broken
Rather jump the turnstyle than pay a token
I'm no criminal, I'm not crooked
But I can't say that I'll never do it
The Kenny Parker beats are just stupid
He finds the funky shit and he loops it
Adds the flavor, bass, hi's and snares
Books a studio session and I meet him there
I grab my lyrics and get a microphone check
And open my mouth, then commence to wreck

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
I used to get weeded, but now I hate the smell
So I stopped just to keep my braincells
Don't like the feelin of bein high
Like to stay down-low and write dope rhymes
If I gotta be high, it's high-paid
And it's not my style to high-profile
Not the only child, one of four
Thank God my pops was too broke to make more
So I make dough for me and the fam
I never know when they might need a helpin hand
Don't get me wrong, I never flash loot
And every now and then I sport my Doc Marten boots
Only in the winter do I wear Timbos
Never been called a broad or bimbo
Don't do the limbo cause it's corny
And I wish they'd sell Snapple by the 40
It took a while to get my album set
Now I'm here and I'm gettin wreck

[ Chorus ]

[ SHOUT OUTS ]
Yeah, Heather B gonna give a few shout outs, you know
Peace to BDP
Peace to Biz Markie
Peace to Kid Capri
Peace to Teddy Ted & Special K

[Verse 1/Daddy Mac]
Hey yo, here's a real scoop, homie loc
Dumb fools around my way gettin' high off gunsmoke
And I ain't talkin' about the high like Indo
The kind of high that make you call your kinfolks
And tell them Oh, Johnny's dead
A fourteen-year-old kid put a nine to his head
All because he wanted that gear he was sporting""
Gimme that, while you're at it, gimme them Jordans
Johnny tryin' to jet, homie wasn't hearing that
Johnny tryin' to run and got gatted in the back
Now tell me what happens to the way things used to be?
'Cause at this rate, there'll be no future, G
When will all of y'all learn
That if you're playing with fire too long, you're bound to get burned
This ain't a small thing I'm addressing
It's a big thing, take it from the daddy as a lesson

It's a shame the way this thing goes dowm
How one lay you down just to show he don't play around
He goes to sleep with a head full of anger
And wakes up involved in a child's gang banger
I'm talkin' about a-tisket, a- tasket
Not knowing next day he'll be laying in the casket
So what you think of that, son?
In the arcade, they playin' the games ain't fun
Something like Pac-man
Same name, but the game as you put it in the sack and
Running to the next board
And gat down the fools standing in the way of the door
There's no board and no points
And in this game, this is what Pac-man wants
The game, the ghosts are always blue
Then you'll slip up and they'll smoke you

[Hook]

None of this exist with the word peace (Brother)
You gotta do more than two fingers, man, please
Get a game that they gotta go by
Instead of ""watch out quick, I send him to the sky""
There ain't nothing to be playin' with
So listen what I give and what I be sayin', kid
Take it from a kid's point of view
'Cause on my way to school, I'll be watching you

Big, big daddy in his caddy with all of his boys
It only had weeks, it's a joy
That's the first part, second part has havin' hard
But when you get count, you know how to restart
You gotta know how to watch your back
'Cause if you're slack, huh, you're going in the sack
I advise y'all all watch out or the game
'Cause the game ain't nothin' but a..

(LET'S GET READY TO RUMBLE!)
In this corner we have the funk bodysnatcher
P Funkadelic and I gat ya hard enough
That I can chew a whole bag of rocks
Chew an Avenue, chew an off street and off block
Then turn around and do the same damn thing to a soloist
Cause Reggie Noble's pissed
I crush the whole brain frame
Cause you couldn't maintain the funk
That have your rap style for lunch, chump
Cause 92, I take a whole crew
Give them a punch of the funk, knock all of their gold tooth loose
(POW)
To show you what type of stuff I'm on
You can't puff or sniff it
Because I was born with it
The Funkadelic Devil, hit you with the rap level of 10
Then 1, 2, 3 You're pinned
I get action, so everybody jump wit your rump
If you like the way it sounds punk
Pump it in your back trunk
And let loose with the juice when I do rock
I'm too hot, some say I got more Juice than 2Pac
(STRAIGHT OUTTA JERSEY)
You heard me, my brother
Im laughin
TIME 4 SUM ACTION

Lights, camera, cock back the hammer
(EXPLOSION!)
Straight from the Land of the Lost
I'mma hit you with the funk force
That make you run your rap style back to the crack aisle
Brotha
Then strike a pose like Madonna
My mom's kicked me out because I did what I want to
The original P-Funk stroke a trunk of funk
Then you saw caps cause my jaw snaps with the raw raps
So color me bad, plus color me black
For the funk that I pack, Red freak it to the funk track
(THE FUNKY FLY STUFF)
Come on and let me kick
(THE FUNKY FLY STUFF)
Just to show you where the HELL I COME FROM
I get dumb with the 1, 1-2
Check my rep, I'm a hit when I have sex
(like this)
Make you twist to the list
Of a funky brain cell when it's puffed on a spliff
And all that, the hi hat, go buy that
Listen, look, OOPS, brother where your eyes at?
They on the floor, pick em up
While I pour a lil funk down your brain punk
Listen to my name chump
(REDMAN READY TO ROCK)
I got a Glock
THEN, POW!, your body is all over the block
Tryin to step to this, the Exorcist, kick it
I get mad wicked when twin cock the biscuit
And blow your head off, just for askin
""Who's the one rappin?""
(POO POW)
TIME FOR SUM ACTION

*spoken*
Yo, 1992, Redman gets paid

Well I be rakin' in the dough, boy (Rakin' in the dough) (Repeat 4x)

Well I was rakin' in the dough, boy, cruising to a beat
When I saw the ??? looking dandy and sweet
I said, ""What's your name"" she said ""Shequelia""
I said ""You want a ride to my crib?"" she said ""Why not?""
Already in the bed cause I had skipped all the ball
Making mad noises as we pushed and pulled
Halfway finished and an hour done passed
Let me spend the next hour riding that (ahhhh)
Mega mega bone, mega mega bow
This has been going on for two hours now
We were finished and we're laying in bed about to fall asleep
When I heard a fact to Z a beeper go ""beep""
I was tired so I said to her ""Who could that be?""
Damn, she looked at her beeper and said, ""Don't worry it's just my man""
I looked at her said said, ""Oh no no no no""
Not trying to be mean, but baby doll you gots to go
You need to step step off with your bad self
Because you're trying to play Sound like a toy
And even though you may think that you got yours off
Ken Dog is still raking in the dough, boy

Well I was rakin' in the dough, boy (Rakin' in the dough) (Repeat 4x)

Well I was raking in the dough, used to cash came fast
A cheese didn't pass, my pockets they harassed
I'm not the type of man to play the herb or get some cheese my dough
I'd rather step to the mall and get some care for
The show, but did you know, the mall was closed
So I spin into Macy's and get some Guess and Polo
Got to the show, stepped out the limo with ease
Seeing mad cheese, promoters with G's
Girls stepping to me, gimme this, gimme that
I seen you on TV, so your pockets must be fat
Damn, she really didn't know that I'm a pro at
The sport called ""Rakin' in the Dough""

Well I was rakin' in the dough, boy (Rakin' in the dough) (Repeat 4x)

Well I remember this show, that I cocked block just to rock some dough
Cause she was all that with the crazy fat afro
Thickness with the quickness tried to cheese now attack
And her reaction, was ""Hi, my name's Twi, and you're?""
Kazo ""Mmm, I really liked the show""
I thought groupie, game, but boy I got game
Cause I took her to my room, she started acting insane
Pulling, begging me for more but the pull cap was sore
]From yesterday's show
Plus, I had no more CO so it really wasn't no-no
And time for her to go, So let the door knob
Hit ya with the good Lord split ya in the rear, dear
Get out of here, Holmes (Excuse me?)
Can't do nothing for the man Kazo
See ya! I'm just raking in the dough

I was rakin' in the dough, boy (Rakin' in the dough) (Repeat 4x)

My dough raker is about the loot
And yes I have enough to get the Polo boots
And Guess, oh yes, I gets no less than dough, yo
Jabo on my legs and the G still begs for
The Mickey and the hickey but no sucking on my neck
Heck, I'd let her catch a flick licking my sidekicks
How I make the money, you'd like to know honey
Making G's with the Z, yo that ain't funny
On tour for sure cause the show is dope, so
To all the other groups, just *kiss* smoke, yo
Cause me and Zhigge tribe is just raking in the dough

Looking for that good stuff ""V.S.O.P""

(x2)
Very fine, yeah, V.S.O.P, V.S.O.P, V.S.O.P ohhhh come on

[Verse 1: Cold 187um & KM.G]

Alright first off then let me introduce myself
I'm the C to the O-L-D 1-87
Oooh, I hear that, the player with the speech
'Cause it's me, KM.G, more flex than a sex on the beach
Ah yes, my brother, takes two to tangle
And since we got them where we got 'em, we better use the right angle
So I'mma push, push in the back of the bush
'Cause it's a wonderful for feelin'
Yeah, 'cause we got the goods for ya suckers in ninety-deuce
The whole pot of gumbo, the whole gallon of juice
So I'mma ease up on 'em, real quick, watch me hit 'em
Well that's all in the ratio of what we hit 'em up for
'Cause when I'm on the dice, I hit a seven comin' out
I'll take your car, your woman, your whole damn house
So now, I step with the quickness (Yeah)
I flex my ends into my Benz and let God be the witness
Oooh I'm finna teach you how the body slam, let me show ya
But step into my world, I got somethin' dope for ya
So holds on, to my woody
And don't be scared when we do the butt boogie
Yeah, it's like bump bump, buh-buh-bump
That's the sound of my heater when the ill stuff jumps
I keep it strictly confidential, bulletproof is requested
Got the fifth in my hand and I've already blessed it
So toast to the boogie, G, 'cause I'm C-O-L-D
The beat is kinda humpin' and I'm tipsy
'Cause everything is on the one, it's a natural high
When I get to the hook of the joint, you know why

[Hook: KM.G]
Everything is fine
When you're rollin' with your homies and a little bit of V.S.O.P
All the niggas gettin' high
With a whole lot of chronic and a gallon of the V.S.O.P
If you wanna feel fine
Free your mind take a couple of mega shots of V.S.O.P
Now you gotta get hype
And you turn into G with a little bit of V.S.O.P

[Verse 2: Cold 187um & KM.G]
To G or not to G, which is the answer?
Out of control, then sold your soul
Yeah they're schemin' on the big hit, and tryin' find a quick pick
Lookin' for the real shit
(*tires screeching and car crash*)
Hold up, but that's counterfeit
On the real, the funk don't appeal
You think you got clout, but you're really down and out
So hold on tight, as we take you down the runway
How many, how many times I got to tell you I don't play?
Oh, and if you didn't know
I had to change my pattern 'cause I roll my ride around the rings of Saturn
Oooh, yeah get in like Venus
See it's been like '89 since the last time you've seen us
Tell me, my peoples did you miss me, on the real
We was never paper champs like Holyfield
Yeah, vision this, that sucker tried to sky me
When I'm hotter than Kuwait or a California earthquake
'Cause I got the munchies for your love, so come and kick it
But you better come prepared 'cause it gets kinda wicked
Yeah, 'cause you can walk the plank if you're schemin' for my bank
Don't play me like a trick, yo, my name ain't Mick
'Cause everything is on the one, it's a natural high
When we get to the hook of the blunt, you know why...

[Hook: KM.G]
Everything is fine when you're rollin' wit' your homies and a little bit of V.S.O.P
When I was at the mall the other day I saw some honeys and I offered 'em some V.S.O.P
Now the party was poppin' when a brotha bailed in with a gang of V.S.O.P
At the end of the jam, you should all run out and get a gallon of V.S.O.P

[Outro: KM.G]
V.S.O.P., V.S.O.P., V.S.O.P., V.S.O.P

[Intro: Majesty]
Awww yeah, uh huh, coming straight from the ghetto
Kicking some newness, Da King & I settin it off
My man Face, Majesty, Izzy, you know what?
Ha ha, catch a vibe

[Verse 1: Izzy Ice]
How smooth can I get? As smooth as a jazz sax
What a class act, now you see why I'm Mr. All That
Pulling rhymes from the back of my dome
The texture of the lecture is then transformed into a poem
Your rhymes are so boring, I'm snoring
Leave me so sleepy Sonny Murdock wouldn't know it's morning
Here comes the negro, one out of the two amigos
That's making the music leaving you hooked by the kilo's
Talking loud and ain't saying nothin'
Your styles are more shitty than buttfuckin'
But I got styles for Anaheim
Ever more deans, when I was nine I was a rough teen
Working hard for my assets so buy the cassette
And if you're Jamacian go get the cass-ette
Take it home and peep the hit
Word up, cause I flip the scrip, there it is

[Hook: Izzy Ice]
Yo, I flip the scrip, cause you flip the scrip
Don't you flip the scrip because, yo, I flip the scrip
Yo I flip the script cause you flip the scrip
Yes I flip the scrip, the scrip is flipped (Repeat 2x)

[Verse 2: Izzy Ice]
Ayo, I write rhymes on the norm
You gotta have the mental uniform to decipher the cuneiform
Cause I flip the script like no one
That's why I ain't surprised when I see rappers running like Jesse Owens
Running away from the habit cause they average
Me and Maj just gots more rap than Randy Savage
More traumatical or dramatical form or tragical
Highly irrational for my capital style
Be ruffing and cuffing you up for a while
Bust how, I'm stepping and busting your butt then I smile
Cause I'll, display at a rate of parlay, I'm suave
And child, I'll groove and I'll prove that I'm smooth like Parkay
Margarine or butter, I'm larger than your mother
I've slain your crew so now I'm fathering another
Now how's that for negative encouragement?
Nourishment is what I dish out, you can't miss out
On an adventure, or a storyline
I'm Fantastic like the Four when it's clobbering time
Peep the skills, those that try to get it are sweated cause it's hectic
When I flip the scrip like this

[Hook: Izzy Ice] 2x (with variations)

[Bridge: Majesty]
Bed-Stuy, flips the scrip, you know it
Flatbush, flips the scrip, you know it
Brownsville, flips the scrip, you know it
Bushwick, flip the scrip

[Verse 3: Izzy Ice]
Bust it
Yo, I flip the scrip like no one else
While others rhyming pretty like a ??? elf
And if your girl try to diss me, I wouldn't care
Because her nigga's on my dick like pubic hair
I come correct because I have to
Ayo my name ain't Johnny but I'd like to make some Cash too
I've been rhyming long enough for free without fee
So where is it, G, cause I flipped the scrip

[Hook: Izzy Ice] 2x (with variations)

[Outro: Majesty]
Yeah, you don't stop, keeping it on
We just flipped the scrip, my man Face, Izzy, Majesty
Signing out, you know we got it going on
Yo, fade me, peace

Aw yeah, it's the Fabulous Chi-Ali coming at ya with something new
You know what I'm saying? We call this one ""Funky Lemonade""

""Lemonade was a popular drink and it still is""

[Verse 1]
Get a taste of the lemon, lime a, rhymer, I'm the mack
A frack a lack, ripping tracks like a tractor
Rap reactor with more than a bionic
Man, I'm blowing up as if I was atomic
No gold on my caps when I rap or when I'm struttin
Cause you know, and I know, ain't no future in fronting
Or fakin when you're funking, flunkie you're flunking
Ring the alarm because you're bum like Jim Plunkett
I get top buck, buck, chill, I'm greater
I drop more flavor than the sun shines on the equator
And I squeeze, the lemon on this water flowing verse
So run and get your cup, cause I know you thirst

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I go splish, splash, I'm swimming
A lemon to a lime and I rhyme for the women
I blow like Hugo Boss, I'm frosty
My name's Chi-Ali, not Kriss, don't Kross me
Over, yes my head with airplay
No, cause if it ain't rough it ain't right, ask Cato
And the S to the H with A
Peace be on to the brothers in the O
Peachy is fat, run and tell your neighbor
I even got a taste test so you can taste the flavor
So get a zip, get a sip, get a guzzle
Simple, no fuzzle, props or a muzzle
And swallow Chi and follow, rocking the Apollo
Freaks follow D Demo back to the limo
So honey let me inject you with some liquid soul and
Oh um ooops sorry, real ho
Now money check your bunny cause honey be undressing me
With her eyes and I advise don't be stressing me
Stress I get enough, ain't that the truth
And some time to get ???
You need proof, get Brandy
I'm no Yankee but when I doodle hot dammit it's a dandy
A real Bronx Bomber
I run with the Legion and we blast with the Big Timer
No comma, or period, or exclamation point
My lemonade it's the joint, check it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Abracadabra, I flow like Niagara
Falls, I take none, you diss me, you got balls
But I got a ball for all of that, what are ya, dense?
Holy cow, another sucker clears the fence
Like Atilla, hon, it gets no iller
You're jocking, I'm locking shit up like Barney Miller
I got big bank, G, like hanky got panky
Pull dollar from Alfalfa, then spank Spanky
But don't thank me, that's the way I make a living, G
Because the pop life is not for me
So color me tic toc, I'm bad, I toc tic
Color me pig, pass the mic and I'll rock
Shiftiest, I'm about to mert squirt mert
Get over like a rat cause I'm fat like Levert
So when you're just coolin or foolin in the shade
Don't forget that FUNKY lemonade

The year is 1971
Now comes the first of the children of Roton
Lords of the Underground witness the brith of the funky child
Doitall, hit 'em

[Verse 1: Doitall]
Born with the funk from the womb of Brenda
She now likes the Lords but you used to dig The Spinners
First with the style from the birth canal
And now I got the flav to make the crowd go wild
Do dig it (screams) ooh watch me kick it
I'm taking no shorts unless it's coming from a midget
I packs the piece more than chicken packed grease
I'm nearly knocking boots, but if not I'll knock teeth
Wahh!
Gaga, ooh cries the baby
Smacked on the ass now the Doitall's crazy
No rattles or playpens, the crowds what I'm rappin'
And yes I do Reruns, as if this was What's Happening
Now January 14th has birthed the funk one
The D-Day for Dupree and yes I'm funk-ay
I got you bobbin' to the funky style
K-Def let 'em know here comes the funky child

[K-Def]
Yeah, born in the underground of Newark, now witness the birth of Mr. Funkee

[Verse 2: Mr. Funkee]
The fifth of the terror, it's the return of Funky Kreuger
A.K. Anger, but yo that's Mr. Funkee Wallbanger
Concieved in the fire by you warned through disaters
The funky child was taught to the ways of the masters
Mr. Funkee, yes girl the black mack is back
Here to kick my funky style, funky this and funky that
You can work day and night, you could practice all your life
But I still take the show and then I go home with the wife
Oh my God, funky with the style, Lord have mercy
I hurdle over rappers just like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Watch me flip the script, let me show you what the funk do
Make you call me uncle (What?) Uncle (What?) Uncle (Who?)
When I was younger I used to sing with my sister
Now I kick the ill styles you have to call me mister
Cooling in the House of Hits, time to buckwild
Raised in the ways of the funky child

(Funky child) (Funky funky style)
(Funky child) (Funky funky style)
Boo-yah
(Funky child) (Funky funky style)
(Funky child) (Funky funky style)
(Funky child) (Funky funky style)
(Funky child) (Funky funky style)

[Verse 4: Doitall]
Well um, back up baby, here come the schooler
We're hit when we dry crawl and hit rock 'n' roller
I'm caught in the swinging, hypnotized by the Pendulum
Just fiddlein' with my electrons, so this is how I'm killing them
K is on the M.P., Jazz is on the Technic
Marley's on the mix and now the Lords have a hit like POW!
Now it's time to get buckwild
And watch my funky brothers freak the underground
In a second, or minute, in no times flat
(Flatline noise) Bring it back
And go grab the album to give the Lords money
Take it home to mom to say ""Ain't they funky?""

[Verse 5: Mr. Funkee]
We gone psycho and everbody thought we was DAS
It didn’t Effect me, I said ""So what?"" I kept on writing rhymes
I keep my funky style perfected so no one can stop my flow
I fear no man, cause if it's on fool, then it's on (And it's on)
Don't worry not for other crews selling out
As long as Lords of the Underground stay underground
The brothers of LOTUG will keep the lyrical fitness
Don't worry about me selling out, mind your business
You might say ""Damn, Mr. Funkee's going out""
But if you listen to the words then you'll know what I'm about
Any props you receive are the props that you earn
I'm off till the funky child returns

I'm sick of you hoes trying to run mine
I'm coming with a gun line running after one time
I got a grudge against you blue suits
Black suits, white suits and state troops
That's the way you made us
Send a nigga to the penitentiary is how you play us
Lock us up for the summer
Took the nigga's name away and passed his ass a number
Just because you legally pack a gat man
Doesn't necessarily mean you have to point it at the Black man
Especially you Black cops, you let your gats pop
Because them Honkies got you brainwashed
So now we come to new dealings
Fuck all the dumb shit
The line of work is cap peelings
I'm cutting shit short
Ain't no filling out reports
Cause you ain't making it to court
I'm letting freedom ring
From the hole in my Glock, for fuckin off Rodney King
It ain't nothing you can ask us
And since justice is blind
I'mma buy the bitch some glasses
Wake the fuck up, chucks
I'm coming after your ass
Crooked officer

Mr. Officer, crooked officer
I wanna put your ass in a coffin, sir
Cause you done fucked with niggas like myself for too long
It's time to grab my motherfucking nine and get it on

[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill ]
Oh Mr. Officer, crooked officer, what's happenin?
You beat another black man's ass and now you're high cappin
Friend, do I have to move to River Oaks
And bleach my fuckin skin so I can look like these white folks?
Just to get some assistance
Because the brutality in my neighborhood is gettin persistent
Cause you wanna harass me
Yeah, and if I talk back you wanna bust my black ass, G
Just like Rodney King
But if you try that shit with me, its gonna be a different scene
Try to pull me over on a dark road
But I'll be damned if I don't grab my nine and unload
Until every blue shirt turns red
You heard what I said
I want all you crooked motherfuckers dead
So you better start pickin out your coffin, sir
Cause I'm comin after your ass...

[ VERSE 3: Big Mike ]
Momma called me up the other day, I got a warrant
Punk ass laws wanna know where the gun went
Said I shot a nigga the other night at a party
Lyin out they ass, I was at home drinkin 40s
Coolin with my niggas playin dominoes in the kitchen
A big black nigga did the killin and I fit the description
Yeah, and you know they think all black niggas look alike
So now they got the flashlight lookin for Big Mike
Jackin niggas up tryin to capture me
Coppers wanna gaffle me
Tryin to put bullets into the back of me
Time and time again I told them I didn't do it
And they knew it, but they still pursued it
So them motherfuckers blew it
So now I'm about to grab my shit
And put them son of a bitches six feet under
Cause I'm sick of runnin from them motherfuckers
Turnin tables cause I'm able, I ain't fallin victim
Time to play a game, see the police, watch me stick 'em
Cause I ain't runnin from a p-o-l-i-c-e
Any motherfuckin t-i-m-e

[Verse 1]
I'm a mother that gave birth young, so what about it
Does it mean right away that I'm wrong
All in due time, well my time is right now
So don't ask me who, where, what when or how
I know I got me and a good partner beside me
One that will never try to desert of defy me
So who are you to tell me how to run my family
I can plan it by myself, I need nobody planning me
'Cause yeah I might be young, but my stability's correct
Everything about my little one I must protect
What she sees, what she hears, and everything surrounding
A decent state of mind is what my daughter will be found in

Chorus:

Born 2 B.R.E.E.D
Young mother be thankful, be strong
The fact that you're young, it ain't wrong
A mother I will try to be
Tha fact is, I was born 2 B.R.E.E.D

[Verse 2]
So tell me what do the kids learn at school
How to pack a pistol, how to play a class fool
Then they blame the parents when the kid plays hooky
Subject to getting shot is something that I wouldn't wanna be
Maybe it is safer to stay within your home
Protecting yourself from getting a bullet within your dome
It's something to think about, the word safe
I often wonder if there exists such a place
Whether on a bus, a train, or plain walkin'
You're subject to the devious ones that might be hawkin'
I'll teach my child to respect every day as a blessing
And follow the path of her future lesson by lesson

Chorus

[Verse 3]
So ask me again if I need ghetto assistance
There's food on my table and my baby's not wearing piss pants
I could teach my child more at home that you could ever
Corrupt the youthful mind I produce, that will be never
This one will learn from me, the other babies too
'Cause what you teach is censorship, I wanna teach what's true
So bother me not with our by the book method
If I was already deaf I would be getting deafer
I know exactly what I'm doing, in it I believe
My life is in my offspring 'Cause I was born 2 B.R.E.E.D

Chorus

"
476,4439,Ice Cube,It Was A Good Day,15,1993-03-27,"

[Produced by DJ Pooh]

[Verse 1]
Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinking, ""Will I live another 24?""
I gotta go, ‘cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Looking in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playing basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day

[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
‘Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watching Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yelling, ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A
Today was a good day

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder
2 in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp""
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Half way home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I got to say it was a good day

[Outro]
Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!
What the fuck am I thinking about?

477,4445,Run-D.M.C.,Down With The King,21,1993-03-27,"

[Intro]
Reporters cry, producers die
They wanna be down with the King!
Producers die, they wanna be down
Wanna be down with the King!

[Verse 1: Run]
Down with the king for years, about ten of 'em
Recruiting suckers, Mac and Mike, and makin' men of 'em
Tears and fears for my peers, they rippin'
You think that it is, it is, if not it isn't
Race for the border my daughter, cause beats you're bangin' out
Jeeps rockin' beats in the streets when there's time for hangin' out
Gather, or rather form a circle around a loud
Cause brothers or others could never ever rock a crowd
Is it because he's runnin' off with the mouth
Or was he really clearly tryin' to play a nigga out
Nope, shut him down, the king with a crown
Cause all you wanna be is Diggy Down

[Hook]
Down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King

[Verse 2: CL Smooth]
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was meeca, and it went this way
Recollect a mecca mic check on the windmill skills
Mac distracts, wearing Godfather hats
It's okay to parlay to forte better
Tell 'em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather
Swing another Rodney King thing and i'll wreck
But just like the white one I get no respect
Money stay awake, cause them other niggas are fake
From Hollis to the Beacon, now your dumb ass is leakin'
C.L. and Run DMC so rush it
Big time way before Hammer got to touch it
Remember the faces in all types of places
Look Ma, no shoelaces
And I'm

[Hook]
Down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King

[Verse 3: DMC]
I'm takin' the tours, I'm wreckin' the land
I keep it hardcore because it's dope man
These are the roughest toughest words I ever wrote down
Not mean for a ho like a slow jam, check it
Sucka emcees could never swing with D
Because of all the things that I bring with me
Only G-O-D could be a king to me
And if the G-O-D be in me, then the king I be
The microphone is granted when it's handed to me
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee
The emcee fiends only seem to agree
That I rock all the world and the society
I rages on the stages with a tune of verse
I get praises from these pages to the universe
My voice is raw, my lyrics is law
I keep it hardcore like you never saw

[Hook]
Down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King

Verse 4: [Pete Rock]
I'm the man you see, in the place to be
I went to John Jay University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
And after twelve grade I went straight to college
Down with the kings on the mic, a full swinger
The P to the R, not an R&B singer
The R to the U-N-D-MC'n
The fly human beings, tonight I hold the key and
Flowin' with the funk track, here to soul brother black
Pick up the bass, better yet leave a space
So let me put my big black twinkie on in to the early mornin'
Had skins yawning'
Mecca? (yo) you want the mecca? (yo)
I'll make a funky beat so we can blow, check it out
Pete Rock's the beat knock, put you in a headlock
And now all the outty out flock is down with the king

[Hook]
Down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King

[Outro]
Down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King down with the king, the king down with the king
The King Down with the
The King Down with the
The King Down with the
The King Down with the
The King Down with the king

478,4447,Tim Dog,I Get Wrecked,23,1993-03-27,"

Intro:
KRS One : Pop pop pop pop!
KRS One : Go uptown, go uptown, go uptown, go uptown (in the background)
(repeats while Tim Dog is speaking)
Tim Dog : Yeahhhh, ha hah, you have been warned
The Boogie Down boys are gonna get ya
KRS One : That's right boye, you are now jammin to the sounds of the Boogie Down
Hit em like this, hoooooooo

Chorus: Tim Dog (KRS-One in parenthesis)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, can I get a yes (yes)
Can I get another one, yes (yes)
Do I get wreck and get respect (yes)
Lyrically I can get wreck (yes), ha hah
Well can I get a ho (ho)
Can I get a motherfuckin' ho, ho (ho)
Do I get wrecked at every show? (ho)
Lyrically I got the flow (ho), So here we go

Verse One: KRS-One

What does KRS and Tim Dog have in common
We both hate corny ass soft commercial rhyme
I don't sound like Phyllis Simon or the Wynans
I rock Central Park but do not mistake me for Paul Simon
I can't hear nothin but wreck, do not force me
I can't hear Fred Astaire sharin Tommy Dorsey you lost me
Pure hip-hop rhymes beats I see
Singers dressed like rappers kickin love songs you can keep
Give me the boom bap when I kick my rap
No need for background singers and dancers, fuck all that
What you see you see, what you hear you hear
When you cheer and you cheer, I'm every first MC's nightmare
The instrumental is fundamentally essential
When I practice I get sharp like a pencil
But the pencil's made of oak, so don't provoke
You'll get broke, whaddya take I for a joke?
I'm radical, mathematical if I have static I'll
Pick up the mic or automatic either way I won't have it
I cover the whole gamit
Mic I'll rap it leaving with your ass out like a faggot
This is a losing battle your like cattle
The sound of my name KRS makes your tail waggle
Better yet you're a snake so it rattles
I'll dice you up like an apple, smash you into Snapple
I'm not, the one you wanna battle that bad
Or just give me your ass I'll make a shoulder bag
I bring the blade all around
By the time I'm done you'll be $2.99 a pound

Verse Two: Tim Dog

Coming from the butcher shop
Fuck with KRS and the Dog and get chopped
Chopped, say stopped, hah think stopped
Stop listen to the hip-hop while others slip-slop
Till they hit the tip-top now it's time to get props
Wack MC's I just tax
I'll eat tracks shit it out with Ex-Lax
Bitch ass niggas step aside
Tenderoni rappers, means your homicide
Toyin non-believers, here's the menace side
Shit aside, come inside, you're goin on a murder ride
I'm energetical theoretical copastetical alphabetical
Hypothetical yeah that is cool, no I'm not a fool
Takin you to school, don't be late for school, fool
I'm suckin your girl while your ass in school
Fool, wipe off the drool, cause I'm too cool
I'm the man with lyrics that jam
Kickin MC's in the face like Van Damme
Shazam, hot damn, thank you ma'am
Don't eat Spam or no types of ham
You thought I fell off? You're smokin somethin
You thought I was soft? You on dope or somethin
You must be on a can of dope and dog food
You actin real rude, don'tcha know I'm Tim Dog dude?
So go ahead and flex, if you got necks
But when I get the mic I get wreck
So come on, come on, come on, come on
I'll eat that ass that's word is born
Rarrrrrgh!

Chorus: Tim Dog (KRS-One in parenthesis)

Can I get a yes (yes)
Can I get another one, yes (yes)
Do I get wreck and get respect (yes)
Are you the king the K the R the S (ohhh yes)
Well can I get a ho (ho)
Can I get another one, ho (ho)
Do I get wreck at any show (ho)
Lyrically I got the flow (ho), there ya go

Verse Three: KRS-One

Now don't say nuttin while I'm checkin ya
Causin hysteria been in more battles than America
Rap messanger, comin in quick I pick up the mizick and watch em stagger
Rip another verse and watch his body splatter
Whether you like me or not don't matter, Kris is not a actor
I'll burn your favorite rapper and leave him in stitches
Weak bitches, real renegade rap rebels rip rhymes
Ferociously, which one of these pussy MC's can go at me
So if you wish to play me like a farmer
I get calmer, chop ya ass up like Jeffrey Dahmer
My pyschopathic fantastic pathic puts you in a casket
On top of that, you can get your ass kicked
Quick, awww shit
I’m physically fit and admit'n I’m lyrical lickin'
And I got more rhymes than Madonna gets dick
And I'm the lyrical lunatic, that flips offness with the quickness
Yo I get heated like cough menthalyptus now
The micraphone I must feel it I must touch it up
Kris One and Tim Dog's come to fuck it up
Evidentally I bust shots till the Glock is empty
No safety, pull the trigger tip don't try to chase me
Down, chase the sound you must be buggin
This is Boogie Down, Boogie Down, Boogie Down
Boogie Down Boogie Down Produc-tions
Jump around be the one is the function
Tim Dog, why don't you show em a little somethin

Verse Four : Tim Dog

Baby baby um, maybe maybe um
You better run, cause you know I have a gun
Bang bang boogie, up jumps the boogie
Take that bullshit rap down the street
A skippedy be bop be bop, Scooby Doo
That bullshit's not me, that bullshit is you
I come correct, get much respect
Do some hummina hummina shit, and still get wreck
Cause I'm the Dog, the muthafuckin Dog ya hear
I'm the Dog, the muthafuckin Dog ya hear
MC's come close but never could get near
Cause I just smash, throwin keys through glass
Take his cash, whip his ass, and do a yard dash
So take your ass home, write a poem
And when you get nice, use the god damn phone
Cause I get buckwild, do some ole freestyle
And beat ya down with the turnstile
Doggie doggie bo boggie fanana fanna fo foggie
Me mi mo moggie, doggie
Rappers goin platinum doin this bullshit
I do the same shit, and make a big hit
Cause if you don't like my lyrical flow
I gotta make dough, don'tcha know, ya little ho-
Mo- sexual I bet you will
Be on the dick if it turns into a hit
But that type of shit is jumpin the fuck off
So I do the same, now I'm comin off
So don't get upset if you can't get lyrical respect
Don't get mad, get wreck

Closing : Tim Dog

Yeahhh, this track has been dedicated, to real hip-hop
The lyrics, peace to all the true hip-hop followers out there
Peace to the Zulu Nation
Peace to Willie D and the Boogie Down Production posse
And peace to the South Bronx, peace! (echoes)

"
479,4448,Kam,Peace Treaty,24,1993-03-27,"

[Verse 1: Kam]
Hittin' corners in a six-trey Chevrolet
Rag-top Impala, top dollar
Got my cousin Laid-Back ridin' shotgun
Cause I got the front-and-back hydraulic hot one
Juiced up, and I'm itchin' to hit the switches
Crawlin' over train tracks, avoidin' all ditches
Ice-skatin' on the 20-inch tires
Jack up the ass, and flex the gold Dayton wires
Now I'm down to take a risk
Gettin' geeked up off a compact disc
I went hoppin' up Crenshaw, niggas hang loose
Lookin' for my homies to celebrate the gang truce
And they about to throw a cook-out
So I'm puttin' down the hump, we sailin' on the look-out
For C.H.P., I was a teenage 'G'
So I'm readin' the graffiti
The walls say 'peace treaty'

[Verse 2: Kam]
Lookin' at the aftermath of the riot
I can still smell the ashes
From all the clashes
But quiet is kept, it wasn't just the blacks
Everybody was lootin', and had each other's backs
We came through in understandin', demandin'
Justice, bust this, we all had our hand in
The cookie jar, took it far enough to make a statement
Daryl Gates - that's where all the hate went
We pass by a swap meet
Been shoppin' at for years, but it couldn't stop heat
See ya, wouldn't wanna be your next door neighbor
Less government relief checks, more labor
10 percent blood suckers of the poor took a loss
For exploitation, had to show em who was boss
Teach em not to be so greedy
Had to shut them down, bound by a peace treaty
Bound by a peace treaty

[Verse 3: Kam]
Hit the park, bailed out the car
And seen blue and red everywhere, look how strong we are
Niggas showin' up from this gang and that gang
Nobody set-trippin', cause it's a black thing
People just partyin', sippin' on a cup
Some of the Compton F.O.I. even showed up
Suited and booted, kickin' it with the locs
In unity, soon we'll be lovin' all black folks
I heard Solo, bumpin' in a Blazer
Clownin' on a car phone, blowin' up my pager
Watts-Up is on the set
Just checkin' out the scenery, brothers I ain't never met
Is hittin' me up, I had to swallow my pride
Just kept steppin', hit em up and said, ""Right""
Ain't no drama, cause I'm mobbin' with Laid-Back
I seen Big Jess, Jay and K-Mac
They used to work them narcotics
Like my nigga L-Wood and Renegade from the street products
We used to jack from the rich, and then give to the needy
But now it's a peace treaty

[Verse 4: Kam]
And now the party's acceleratin'
The whole crowd bounce, and sho' nuff celebratin'
Ain't nobody bustin' shots
I bumped into Mike AKA Mo' Like Watts
An O.G., cause he's older
Lovin' every minute of it, with the camcorder on his shoulder
So he could capture the moment, and reminisce
I'mma always remember this
Because my niggas made the history books
And now the mystery looks
A lot clearer
The man in the mirror got power
It's now or
Never, more than ever
Black people have to stick together
But yo, let's hear it for the Bloods and the Crips
I gots to admit it, y'all brothers did it
I just hope it don't cease
For the sake of all the homies that's restin' in peace

[Sadat X]
Aiyyo Jamar I got a girl that's bad! (uh-huh)
But she don't understand my ways.. (why's that?)
Arguin days after days after days..

[Lord Jamar]
Well I can dig it
See I done had some fly ones
But they try to get just that, thought I'd like to chase the cat
But I'm not a Dog, God is who you're lookin at
Couldn'ta tooken that, bullcrap, you woulda caught a jack

[Sadat X]
I told her, ""Yo the first thing is when the telephone rings
It ain't really nuthin but noise""
You wanna flip and lose your poise?

[Lord Jamar]
Now they quick to flip, but yo honey get a grip
You gotta understand I'm a man with needs that needs fulfilling
And if you ain't with it somebody else is willing
You gotta love me, or leave me alone

You gotta love me, or leave me alone
You gotta love me or leave me alone *4X*

[Sadat X]
I got this good thing girl, it's the righteous love
Not that quick on the top, one shop hop
I'll make your knees get wet in the places I'll pet
I'll make you breathe, faster than you can believe
Within your hole I'll use my control
And the final burst, I'll hold
*reggae chat* until it comes
Backscratches added up in sums
Didn't your momma teach you bout b**** a man?
Bent my d*** so bad that I ran
Now I'll, freak of the week, or ride the quest of a yardgirl's hips
Your p**** can't see these lips
I keep my tongue in my mouth.. cause I can't see down South
Vulgar? Maybe, obscene with the purpose
Sayin, ""I'ma do my own thing, bein I'm my own King..
And it's up to you to follow""
So on your Wisdom I'll shine my light
Bring forth the seed, created in the night

You gotta love me, or leave me alone
You gotta love me or leave me alone *4X*

[Lord Jamar]
The degree, love h**** right, get it right
Either all the above, or it ain't true love
I ain't down for a honey who don't wanna submit
Always throwin a fit, wanna talk a lot of s***
But love to get hit from behind
Gettin crazy joy from my Lazy-Boy that reclines
Seems the only time we're not in a fight..
Is when I'm layin the pipe..
You don't want me to bone another chick
Quick to claim my name and my d***
But when I tell you get off the swine and get refined
You act like you're blind and you lost your d*** mind
See I'm not the kind to let a woman run it
How my man Rick say it? _I Shouldn't Have Done It_
Is what I'd be saying if you was runnin the show
No h*, there's no gold, the G-O-D know
The time on the Sun and the Moon and the Stars
Dance to the tune of Lord Jamar
And if you're actin tone def it's your own mental death
Huh, you gotta love me, or leave me alone

You gotta love me, or leave me alone
You gotta love me or leave me alone *4X*

Boom bash, wake up, I set it off right
Look around and turn your wet dream to fright night
You can call me R&B, that's only if it stands for Rough Brother
Word to my grandmother
I buck you in the head just to let ya know
Stick you for ya dough, spit on the flo'
Drag it out of ya, bring it on
I smack him back down, yo dope word is bond
I know you want a piece of the champ
But you roll too weak, you couldn't make it in my camp
You thought I went for the flip
But I'm bustin' off hip-hop clip after clip
I kept you out there, ripped you for your wear
Jump inside your video, bust you with a chair
Smack slap smack slap smack slap smack
Just to make it worse and hurt your pride I'll run it back
Smack slap smack slap smack slap smack
Click click boom, stop dead in your tracks
Stick the steel in your mouth
Buck buck buck buck buck, lights out

(""I'm comin'"")
How ya comin' baby?
(""I'm comin'"")
This is how I'm comin'

The album that I'm comin' with is rough, the flavor's mean
(ooooh) kickin' you for real in the guillotine
Fourteen shots to your dome kid
I'm doin' time in the game like a bid
Movin' rhymes like a package
So stigetty step up and get your nostrils damaged
Shootin', lickin', bustin', sprayin', all of that
And then some, dead dead dead, one by one
Never step to a real man
Cause your rhymes only work on a playground program
They impress your little friends, bring you a little ends
But you still you gotta ride in your man's Benz
Word to hip-hop, I'm a blast ya
Gotta set you on fire cause I gassed ya
Boom, blow, Batman, bang, pow
Unh (what) unh (what), that's the way it's goin' down
My new album ain't no joke
You wanna take me out, how many bunch ya smoke?
I'll never slack again, I'm off the job like the mob
Hey, no prob', many solved, on the knob, make his heart throb
What you gotta deal with is real, made of steel
You can feel it comin', burnin', buildin', flowin' like an eel
Movin', killin', breakin', servin' you just like a meal
Take off your clothes and taste the steel

[Hook]

Check baby

Rockabye baby on the roof top
Open up your mouth and taste my Glock
When your jaw breaks your gold teeth will fall
Down will come the monkey, banana clip and all
Splat (buck buck buck) it's all over wit'
Another plan O.D.'ed over my war hit
The way I'm workin' and jerkin' and hurtin' brothers converted
Non-believers get murdered, that’s how I preferred it
Get your face out the bill, catch the thrill
Carry a nine put your hoochies on the bill
The thought of you gettin' scarred turns me on
Like my first television with my backup tip hard
So where's your mouth kid? Where's your heart shorty?
It's all over, cash your chips in, crack a forty
You look thirsty, you ain't gettin' no mercy mercy
And ain't no way that you can rehearse for me
Murder I wrote, murder I wrote, is what I figure
It's in my tote, it's in my tote, so I pull the trigger
Put up your women, your crib, your speakers
Your dog, your cat, your crate, your speakers
Your sister, your aunt, your crew, your Knicks
Got 'em booin' all you other rappers who think that's too tough
Bam bam, here's a hit you wish you had
A hit that makes you mad, a hit that makes you slap your dad
Dead dead dead, kill dead, kill dead
Try to battle me I gots to buck you in your head
I pull your file, click
I know you're good to style, blaow
Livin' wild, when it comes to this I never smile
What did you learn from the lesson I just gave ya?
Obey your mama, be on your best behavior
It's never endin' and I am recommendin'
You put your name as Brendan
I see y'all that is blendin'
The message that I'm sendin'
Is there ain't no pretendin'
Get in the trunk, buy the album, here to end it

This is how I'm comin'
How ya comin' baby?

Eenie meenie, I funk like Houdini

When it comes to the funk, I rock pronto

Peep the weak, greet the beast with cheap sticks & feet sweeps
I hated gas, but I freak, cause I got beef with white sheets
I'm leaving school styles lumpy, plus I won't break the humpty dumpty but I keep the hoochie coochies coming
I hear a honeycomb hideout, slide's out
So honies you can come where all the heads hides out
I pray for the chump that bumps me or plays me like a punk
So jump, jump if you want me

[Bridge: Treach]
It's another number one, Da funky Youngstas
It's another number one, Da funky Youngstas
It's another number one, Da funky Youngstas
Cause we go flip, flap, flip, flap, fast or slow

[Verse 2: Taji]
In front me, jump me like that
Ain't funky was for a fact
Pick the stick, I'm the camel with four backs
But you can't break the back,it's a strong cow
Plus I bet you didn't know that yo, we drinking milk now

[Verse 3: Quran]
Walk the walk, talk the talk, chalk I stalk
Like a hawk, when I break your whole walk, when your foot gets caught

[Verse 4: Taji]
Cause we ain't rip the bull shot
Hit you with the full shot
Booyakas heard when we pull props

[Verse 5: Quran]
Who's hot, bring what's hip-hop, I say
Ain't no flowing ho-hooray
Cause we can get done

[Verse 6: Taji]
Here's another from Da Youngstas
The mother number funky substance
Straight from illy Philly funkstas

[Hook: Da Youngstas]
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop

[Verse 7: Tarik]
On a deal with it
Only if you want the rough, the whole funk
The stuff, with the trunk if you can't freak the funky front
But don't fake the moves, shake the moves
Cause if ain't paid your dues, then my neighbor crew'll spray your crew

[Verse 8: Quran]
And I ain't even saving you
I be a part of the slaughter that makes it harder for your squad to move
Now what the hell you trying to prove
You bore me, till my styles'll have your DJ dancing for me
Glory, halleluah
My style'll do ya
And we run through ya like we ain't knew ya

[Verse 9: Taji]
Da Youngsta will pump ya
Funkin & dump in your dreads, the styles of lead from the headhunter
8, 12 and 20 bars, I'm fully on the money pile
Mic styles charge cause I pull their card
And we can kick the flow for the young bros
The short bros, home bros, that's looking for the old gold
A lotta rhymes, I never mind, that was kind
It was cool, but now they sound fool, so I say never mind
You'll always stay a style behind my rhyme
And you're getting dropped
When the crewz pops to the hip hop

[Hook: Da Youngstas]
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop
Crewz pop, it's the hip-hop, pop pop

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin...

[Verse 1: C.L. Smooth]
A sweet serenade, sip lemonade
As we laid inside the shade
My heart was captured when you possessed it
Carressed and blessed it, even suggested
You love me and I love you
And together, it would just be us two
I would protect ya, in your moment of fear
Relax, lover come here
And let's create this heavenly fantasy
When you lay next to me
I need you, and only you, to give me more
Tender love right down to the core
If you could read what's on my mind
You will find my feelings are genuine
Day after day, you're the one I'm thinking of
With lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin...the heat

[Verse 2: C.L. Smooth]
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
Make love everyday, okay, produce
I ride through the tunnel of love, share a milkshake
Carve our name in a tree by the lake
Look in your eyes cause I miss you much
The way you say, ""I love you, C.L."" and your gentle touch
We reminisce with a french kiss
And out of all the girls, you're the first on my list
The only one now, and truly for life
My fiancée and future wife
Now you realize, you're the one I'm thinking of
With lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin...the heat

[Verse 3: C.L. Smooth]
You want to be treated like a queen, stroked like a kitten
Every night you're the mitten I'm fittin'
Tease your lips with the tip of my tongue
And there's no doubt about it, lady, I'm strung
On your love, looks, and affection
You qualify, top choice selection
Woman of a darker breed
Mmm, cutie, you got what I need
Pour the champagne and toast the glass
Taste, but don't drink too fast
Cause we got many nights to cuddle by the fireplace
You blush when I touch your face
Now you realize you're the one I'm thinking of
With lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin...the heat

[Verse 4: C.L. Smooth]
Allah made you beautiful and youthful
So I feel giving you love is suitable
A walk by the beach, watch the sunset
Love is strong, like when we first met
Wake up in the morning, see your face
And I feel no one can take your place
Ever, so don't even think about it
I need your love and I can't live without it
Baby, you're the one I'm thinking of
From C.L. Smooth, with lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin...the heat

[Verse 1: Bootie Brown]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stand, come to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

[Hook]
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Never the less, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Never the less, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pa--

[Verse 2: SlimKid 3]
When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly
See she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad, and I could be her nigga
But, all I can do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try to stop her stride
Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by

[Verse 3: Imani]
Time for me to voice my opinion can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Damn, she looked good, down side: she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man

[Hook]
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Never the less, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Never the less, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me

[Verse 4: Fatlip]
Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me be just moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her, and it went
My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt, I symp
Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp
Cause then I would let you know that I love you so
And if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you
Then I signed sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, PS Love Me Tender
The letter came back three days later: Return to Sender, damn

[Hook]
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Never the less, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by

You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

[Verse 1]
You - you told me that you loved
But it wasn't never really me you dug
Or digged
You said I was ya nig
And come to figure out
That you was all about you
And every single step you take
You took for you

When I first met ya
You were looking rough
In ya Timbaland boots
Cut up shorts and Egyptian musk
Smelling like an African queen
Could this be my dream?
But everything ain't really what it seems

A couple of months went by
And you and I was thick
Then you started changing
And scripts began to flip
Things that you said
You had to do on Sunday
Was now moved to Monday
Where were you on Wednesday

You had to take advantage cause I was nice
If you bought me something once
I had to buy you something twice
You told me that your friends sat you down
And said you really oughta leave me
Believe me
Truthful

[Hook]
You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

You told me

[Verse 2]
Yo - too much of a party animal
I couldn't handle you
Always being out
Once in a while was understandable
Where did I go
Where did I go wrong
Was it my fault or your fault
So now I [?] over a malt
Came to the conclusion
That you were confusing
Cause all along
I thought it was wrong
I thought it was me

Started bugging out
Stopped hanging out
Feeling doubt
Wasn't looking out
But now I'm Swayze

I gave you props
You were smart and intelligent
And if things went wrong
You stood strong and rebelled against
And how you changed me
Had me reading books that amazed me
And just to say hello you would page me

Had a real pretty smile
Like an innocent child
Most of the time calm
Every now and then buck wild
Treated you good, thought I should
Always thinking of ya
You were fly and I loved ya
Truthful

[Hook]
You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

[Refrain]
You said you'd be around
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Yo - sad to say goodbye
But I gotta cause it's over now
Why because you did me wrong too long
Plus you broke your vow
Never meant to
But you said your time was definitely wasted
But I'm truly grateful for the flavor that I tasted

See ya
Hate to be ya
But I wish that I was with ya
Now I'll be on my way
And no, I definitely won't forget ya
I don't know where you are
Wherever you're at this one's for you
Remembering all the [?]
And different things we used to do
Truthful

[Hook]
You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

You told me
You loved me
You told me
You'd be truthful about my love

[Malik]
Yo, check it out
Coming right back at you
With another slamming hit
Illegal in the motherfuckin house
With Erick Sermon, takin over in the 90's, youknowhatI'msayin?
E-Double on the solo tip
And this how we gonna do it
We gettin buzy on this track
Aiyyo, check it
Do ya like this

Malik'll play the lawnmover, and Kris'll play the grass
I just ate MC's, cause why? ABC whipped!
Illegal cuts that ass, the way that I will punch you
Wouldn't think I was a kid G, that's why I took the time out
To say that I gets buzy, like Dizzy, Gillespie
So suckers stretch your eyes, but you still couldn't see me
Now, skippidy-doo-dah, di-di-di da-di-day
I don't need no permission, I still come out and play
To Uncle Sam I say, ""Scram!"" Say my numbers aren't enough
But to get wreck with the army, all I have to be is rough
And tough, and no need to lie about my age
Just get fly with my tongue, and go on a rampage
I'm going off, because it's Little Malik
And no sucker, it's not all about maturity
Now if you want beef, fuck it, cause a fuss
And no, little kids, this ain't nothin for Da Youngsta's
Ya can't even see me
It's no relation, so we can't run in the family
Yeah, and I'm still the boss
Cause I'm a straight up nigga, ain't nothin bout me Kris Kross...
... you little rejects
I have the intellect to get respect, I'm gettin wreck
Don't even try to scam, because you're no threat to me
Can't write ya own rhymes, sellin Jermaine's life stories
Chorus: (*repeats in background*
""For all of y'all, keepin y'all in health"" --] Slick Rick)

I getz buzy
I getz buzy on this track, cause I getz buzy
Malik getz buzy on this track, cause I getz buzy
Malik getz buzy on this track, cause I getz buzy
Malik getz buzy on this track

[Jamal]
I getz buzy with my shit, you shouldn't shoulda fucked with me
I'm not a ordinary kid it's the Illegal shit G
And with Malik, my shit'll be pumpin, you're punkin
You step out ?like the fuck in it? just like a pumpkin
Swingin bolos, and buckin buckshots
So when you look in the mirror, it be Illegal on your knots
So my advice to you is fade, stay out my way
Cause I'm a young bull on a rampage, I don't play
Damn them boys are dope and my rhymes and crews are fat
Check out my ryhmes, and now check my gat
Because I'm always strapped pack with a loaded rhyme
And steppin niggas get knocked off, from here to Zimbabwe, out
Cause I ain't havin that shit, in ninety-three
Cause if you fuck with this shit, you gotta fuck with Malik, uh-huh
You call me pussy, come and play you get fucked
But if your britches get burned, I call ya shit out of luck

[Erick Sermon]
Ahhhhh, make me wanna holla (""RRAAAAAOOWWW!"") scream like Busta
And get down, get down, from 'You a Customer'
Cocaine hit, E-Double the shit, yo
I'm swifter than Flash when I'll be cracking that black ass
Like this, my style's mackadocious
And rumpshaking, like the bumba claat Jamaican
Who can see me? My rap format is cock diezel
When I be rockin with Illegal
It Smells Like Teen Spirit, but not Nirvana's
It's real hip-hop music, like Afrika Bambaata's
So step off, heeyyyyyyy, heyyyyyyy
Yo it's the E-R-I-C-K yo...

So just sit back, relax, if you got a big bozak grab that
Like Mr. Long, my brother from another mother
Yo check it out

(Bounce, make it bounce, make it bounce, c'mon!)

Speak to your speaker, cause it's the time of day
Something new for the mass, people
Tribe hard, die hard, shit, harldy ever
Not never, but whichever your pleasure whatever's clever
We're deeper than the ports in the back of your cerebellum
Dres, Dre, and Showbiz is rippin this shit, so tell them
We came, we saw, we broke the fuck out
You play, you lay, but if you give good hay you can stay
Hey, what's wrong with the world today?
Brothers busting brothers for less than time of day
The pay for Hammer's, proper, ain't no
Sunshine, and whitey's got your mama
So do you wanna change for the children with a comma?
For who? Me, I, myself, you know the one
Doing what I gotta do when I do, come
I just get off, not just that, yo I say I
Do it good and Chaka Kahn knows that we be in Hollywood
Don't get jel if we cash large checks
Casue we skiddly-dip-dip-do-dep dip dip for effects
Brothers think I'm dissing, but I'm really on the dicks
Look into my album, kid, you'll see all the flicks
But no! You'd rather feel my movie just to cold me
So I was boning mama and your mother fucking told me
I'm playing, I really got no time on the real
But yo, the shiek be unique, so do what you feel
Don't think I'm live? Then take a swigga
Cause I'm from Queens and I roll with Bronx niggas

Check it, check it, check what I say
You can bounce with Dres, or you can bounce with Dre
You can flip the script, or you can parlay
Or you can learn the words and say what we say

If you're hitting up some skins (Ya gotta bounce ta this)
If you're cooling at a club (Ya gotta bounce ta this)
No matter what you're doing, no matter what you're doing

[A.G.]
They say more bounce to the ounce, well a Giant weighs tons
Stepping to the two, but we're not the ones
Brothers are flipping, some other suckers are tripping
Yeah, you gotta take a whipping to see that I'm live and kicking
I'm the A to the G-I followed by the A-N-T rolling with the Show B-I
Black boots, black hat, slick like a black cat
Flip like a fat cat? Never none of that, black
But I got techs for those who wanna flex
So many styles, you don't know which one is coming next
We've been bouncing to the ounce for months
Finesse is here, yeah, Premier's got the blunts
Jazzy's getting jazzy, Big L is raising hell
Show is bugging with the beats, and he's Bhudded, can't you tell?
Diggin in the Crates is in our corner
Ice Water, Deshawn, and Long is getting longer
Gary Gator got the lethal

497,4622,Geto Boys,Six Feet Deep,23,1993-05-15,"

There's far too many of you dying

[Verse 1:  Scarface]
June twenty-eight was the date
Thirty-eight to the chest plate
Mommy dear's cryin at the wake
And everybody's dressed up in black suits
Goin to pay their last respects to the black troop
Why'd he have to die is the question that we're under
But everyone knows that every day's a different number
So when your time comes, just remember, G
You'll always have a place in this world as a memory
Especially my boys who passed away back in '92
Best believe that all the boys in the hoods got love for you
Wherever we go, wherever we be, we be thinkin
Of how we hung in the clubs smokin and drinkin
Never missin out on a hood fight
Cause everyday back in the hood we had a good fight
Everything has changed and people are lookin lonely
It's gon' be strange spendin New Year's Eve without your homie
But ain't much that we can do
Except pour brew throughout the crew
To make sure we all remember you
And believe me it hurts
To see the boy you broke bread with six feet in the dirt... dirt

[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
Another homie got smoked but it's no surprise
Everybody's trippin cause the boy was too young to die
A sad sight to see my homie take his last breath
Everybody's trippin cause they can't accept my homie's death
Another killin was reported on the evenin news
Somebody's brother got killed behind a pair a shoes
In the midst of all this shit I think about myself
Wonderin when somebody's gonna try to take me off the shelf
But I refuse to be another violent casualty
So when I'm rollin I pack my pistol grip beside my knee
Cause on the city streets today a brother just can't win
When the people you think are your friends really ain't your friends
Uh, and Bushwick can't sleep
When everybody around me keeps fallin six feet deep

[Verse 3: Scarface]
The pain that's deep inside of everybody grows
As they approach to see the body before the casket close
The person standin next to me has snapped a flick
Once I seen the casket closed I knew that that was it
The whole entire family spoke on his defense
The choir sung the songs that make us reminisce
And durin all the singin I broke down myself
When I looked and seen the family that my partner left
And then the choir broke into its final song
Thinkin to myself the worst is yet to come
Everyone was headed for the final flight
As we creeped along the gravel on the burial site
The director said his words and there was not a sound
As they lowered my little partner towards inside the ground
Everybody dropped their flowers on the coffin top
And then they work alone with the concrete block
And that's deep

[Verse 4: Big Mike]
A lotta homies die, a lotta mothers cry
I watch tears fall down from their eyes
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to take the chance
They chose the music, so they had to dance
Couldn't tell him nothin, was a player, had to have it
Got caught up in the game now my boy's in the casket
And everybody's lookin' for somebody else to blame
Ashamed to let his mother know that he was in the game
We used to kick it on the ave at night
Comin up tryin to have the finer things in life
But now my boy's gone, I wish he was at home
I wish he wouldn'ta never fell victim to the clone
So when I drink a brew for you I pour some on the block, son
You might be gone but you damn sure ain't forgotten
So long, remember whenever or wherever
Dead or alive, real partners come together
And you know that

[Verse 3: Third Eye]
Bling, bling! Who's that with Super Cat?
(Third Eye!, Third Eye!)
Yes black, where all my troopers at?
(Uptown!, Uptown!)
They got my back but I'm still strapped
Got the real phat, phat track for my ill rap, black
Ain't no shame in my game, Jesse West is real
You think that I won't scoop your girl? Oh yes, I will
Check it, check it, it gets hectic, I'mma wreck it
I make fellas jump up and girls get butt naked
So, ring around the rosey, a pocket full of dough G
You know me, I'm low key, I'll smoke you like a stogie
There is no way you can see me, like Stevie
Wonder how I'm living G, oh I'm living lovely
It's a Bad Boy thing, '93 we coming through
Kick it with the flava dude, hit ya on the 1 and 2
Send you on a mission, and you think I'm crazy
Super Cat, dolly, dolly dolly my baby
I'm crazy

[Verse 4: Puff Daddy]
Knock, knock (who's there?) Puff Daddy, hops
Slick trooper from the Q, come with mad props

My man, we make hits, the fly shit that they kick
On your radio, it's the Bad Boys, yo
Making mad noise yo, '93 so act like you know bro
(Who is it?) Puff Daddy rolling through with Super Cat and Mary J
So what ya say, what ya say

[Verse 5: Biggie]
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
The show stoppa, the rhyme droppa
Super Cat pass the Glock, uh, I see you shivering
Check the flavor Biggie Smalls is delivering
Lyrical lyricist flowing lyrics out my larynx
Chubby competitor, quick to kick a chump in the chest
Yes, it's Bad Boy, (Right) hard to the core
LAWWD! Me can't take it no more
Out

""I'm a Bad Boy, I'm a Bad Boy, I'm a Bad Boy""

[Introduction]
Peace, peace, peace y'all
Strange
Real strange, real strange
An overdose, a nickel bag of funk
Now move on, move on yeah
Hey man are you ready to go

[Verse 1: Butterfly]
Boogie jive and rap is life where I'm from
Where I'm from, Ahmed play with Izzy where I'm from
Where I'm from, it be like run your coat black
Jupiter, keeps her fat beats by the pack
Where I'm from, nappy hair is life
We be reading Marx where I'm from
The kids be rocking Clarks where I'm from
You turn around your cap, you talk over a beat
And dig some sounds booming out a jeep
Where I'm from, cocoons hide the youth, swoon units hundred proof
You want some beef, they will cut you some where I'm from
The beats is infinite where I'm from
Voodoo, ashubani, gangsta lean where I'm from
I'm interplanetary, my insect movements vary
It's kinky if it's hair, G where I'm from
The fire hoses blow
It's purple when it snow
I do a hit and go, split
It's hip, what's hip
When hip is just the norm
Cause Planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all its forms
The kinks, the dance, the prints in all the shirts
My grandmother told my Mama that it's Africa at work
On vibes, we freak, them universal beats
You find it at the spot you hit at ends of every week
We twist, exist, to spin the maddest hits
Up here funk is our neighbour so we paid her a visit
The lip we sip can't house the nine zips
For rock we can't do nothing, for this we come equipped
Off disc, off tape, rap blasting til from eight
The really truly fat the fly on the flip
Cocoa gotta know, how Planets gotta roll
Speak the mega cool, get funky as a goal
It's calm, relax, we're only some new jacks
That acts from the funk but don't play the role
Where you from

[Verse 2: Doodlebug]
Weekend Dig Plans got T's where I'm from
Where I'm from, it's Clarence 13 where I'm from
Where I'm from, brothers took the beat and got fly
(Why?) That's most asked by 85, where I'm from
Faking the funk you get did
Projects, tenements, pyramids where I'm from
We living off the boom boom crack
It's that hip-hop rockers, jazz when I max
Peace be the greeting of the insect tribe
Pestilent forces can't catch the vibe
We live to love and we love to rock mics
We speak in ghetto tongue cause ghetto's the life
Food for thought so get a buffet plate
The lyrics are so fat you might gain weight
So just watch me step alone, into the sunset
Left foot right foot 1-2 mic check
Brewing funk inside my soul kitchen
So pull up a chair, here's a bib, have a listen
Of hardhead intervene, damn I know you're fluent
Yeah, cause Doodle ain't having it and Butterfly knew it
Where you from

[Verse 3: Ladybug]
Venus acts a fool at the square right, yeah
Doctors engineer in a pair right, yeah
Hip-hop made a point last year right, yeah
But Planets is the joint this year right, yeah
Planets got the dubs and live to grass-hop
Duck out from the fuzz, that sweat the hip-hop
Rising like we foam, get it from the dome
I'm from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
We can get a kit, without no thread
Feeling funky beats go straight to the head
Fall into a club, dig on what we love
It be past six before we reach bed
Butter freaks on relics we say those are fat
Doodle, Mecc, and Silk, the quad where it's at
We need to stack a sack, for rap to take us dap
So we treat our clips, just like busting caps
Rip it till dawn, kick it till dawn
Hip-Hop is the fix or else we be gone
People thought they canned it
Rap is not by bandits
Digable Planets got it going on

[All Together]
Everywhere, every every where, yeah

500,4643,Big Daddy Kane,How U Get A Record Deal,19,1993-05-22,"

[Verse 1]
On the Black Caesar tip, my dialogue is just like
A frank inside of a supermarket, raw dog
I'm the untouchable, never to be took out
A Sexy Mother.. ooh child, Prince look out!
I'm keepin girls of all shades on my trail
From a Sister Act down to a Single White Female
Cause when I hit the skins they all say, ""Damn Kane -
You knock out the Bush like a presidential campaign""
But if you think that lickin' toes makes me weak
You better treat me like Freddy Krueger: don't sleep
I write raps, ready to rip and rock real rough rhymes
Run in rugged and raw, rapidly ruinin' roaches
Point blank, I spell murder to a bum
All you backwards rappers: REDRUM, REDRUM!
Cause I do em somethin awful, break em down to a morsel
Makin sure that you're no longer adorable
Rappers get so quiet when I'm comin', that if they
Shitted a dictionary, you couldn't get a word from em
It's sort of a tradition in Bed-Stuy to do or die
So steppin to me is suicide
I couldn't think of a rapper takin' mines
I feel like Ali, ""I'm the greatest of all times""
Floatin' like a butterfly, stingin' like a bee
Yeah I know this ain't boxing but that's still my pedigree
But as for you, you have no appeal
How you get a record deal?

[Verse 2]
Like shell-toe Adidas, ain't a damn thing changed
The way I shoot off lyrics like a firing range
Breakin' out in a cold sweat, the death threat
Gettin' more props than a movie set
The smooth microphone assassin, rhymes keep blastin'
Uh, I keep the body count massive
But if you say you increased the Body Count troop
You must admit that you joined Ice-T's group
Cause you ain't hurtin' niggedy nuthin', so why you bluffin'?
Tryin' to be the new Big Daddy Something
But there's only, before me, no one is richer[?], huh
You couldn't come Pryor if your name was Richard
Cause I'm the Alpha and Omega
Arm-Leg-uh-Leg-uh-Arm-Head, stayin' raw til I'm dead
And to battle me you shouldn't even try
Cause with wings on your tongue, you still couldn't say nothin' fly
And I don't care if you bring a crew
And I don't even care if someone else writes for you
Man, you could even be someone the crowd may just like but shoot
You couldn't see me with a bifocal mic
Check my resume, Rapmasters, Word Up!
Yo! MTV, BET, The Box and all that good stuff
And Billboard for my five year duration
And see that I got more spots than a dalmatian
Let's get down to finish this large
You could bring on your whole squad, none of you chumps are hard
All that garbage you mumble ain't real and seriously, seriously
How you get a record deal?

[Verse 3]
A lot of rappers today, wonder
Should I ask Kane to write rhymes for me to say?
Well you're god damn right you should
Cause my rhymes are like spandex, they make any ass seem good
So act like you know Baby Pop
When I riggedy rock the higgedy hip-hop non stop, as I
Freak the funk and flip the flavor to flow with the flyest
A fury full force in the flames of the fire, now
May these MC's rest in peace
Because when I come to town, the population decrease
I leave em finished, dead and that's that, huh
Not even Pet Sematary could bring em back
I slay my pray, A to K, I tell em like Jennifer Holiday
No no no no no noooooooooooo way!
That you could ever touch this, no you know how I feel?
I think you bought your record deal..

Shorty don't front, you better act like you're widdit

Prepare to stay long, cause I don't cum quick
Little or big, I tear that ass out the frame
Talkin like you're ill, but the shit is all game
You're weak on top, you can't ride like a stallion
Hit it from the back, then I'm audi 5000
But if you're ill we can chill smoke the fat Phil'
A little somethin just to make shit real
Off with the light, fuck a invite, just make sure
You don't got the period, cause I don't want red lights

Bulletproof I refuse to let the monster get me

Shorty black never tap no skins that look wack
I got mad game like Twister, nasty little mister
Quick to talk dirty to a sister
I met the shorty at the Skate Key
What's her name? Nevermind, cause she might try to sue me
Juiced her up, took her to the projects
So uh, if she was with it maybe we could have sex
You know what happens next, drop to your knees
Bitch caught a bone ? spin I win
As she starts to proceed, she said she wanted me
To drop a seed, I told her parlay and just be
Cause cunt little stunt with my butter dick shorty
You talk too much, so lay back and enjoy the blunt
I put it in her, she starts to wild
She said slow down, I said this is shorty wop style
A versatile, rough sex, fuck love makin
Flip the script shorty, and flip yourself over
On your hands and knees Cochise
From the back I don't shoot blanks and I'm out black

I'm sick up in this game
I'll take no secondary shorts &
Slam dunk these riddles up in yo' chest like Jordan
Menace II Society mad man killer
Just call me the East Bay Gangsta
Neighborhood drug dealer
Quick to make decisions & I'm
Quick to get my blast on
Do a 187 with this bloody Jason mask on
Rollin' up out the cut deeper than Atlantis
Tore his chest apart left his heart on the canvas
Now I gots mo' mayo than the rest of the pushers
Rat a tat tat tat came my Tec from the bushes
I blast with no heart cause I'm heartless in nine-trey
A-K blast on that ass if in my way, gangsta
Slangin' 'Cola since the very very start
Much love for this game so the trigga gots no heart

Ain't no love trick
The trigga gots no heart
[Repeat]
(gunshot)

Verse 2
Release the trigga as I blast on a nigga
Nina put a cease on his Timex ticker
And uhh playas he can't give me no love
Cause I'm stuck on the corna in the ghetto
Slangin' dub sacks
And I duck when they fly by
Cause Killa Cali' is the state for the drive-by
Caps peel from the gangstas in my hood
Ya better use that nina
Cause that deuce-deuce ain't no good
And umm I'm taking up a hobby
Maniac murderin' doin' massacre robbery
I'm twenty-two & I'm still slangin' dub sacks
I gives the fiend some love but ain't no love back
Much love in this game ain't no love gangsta
187 is a art cause the trigga gots no heart

Ain't no love trick
The trigga gots no heart
Ain't no love trick

Me shootin' him up me shootin' him up
If he no give my pay
Ain't no love trick
[Repeat]

Verse 3
The trigga gots no heart
& I'll be damned if I'm broke old
Pushin' on a shoppin cart
They blast on a friend of me
Another sad case of a mistaken identity
12 O' clock & my 'hood's dubbin' pay back
I sat & watched them shoot my homey
Seen his face crack
Uzis spray like Raid on these cockroaches
A dropped bomb full of 187 soldiers
Doin' dirt cause we dirty when the trigga pull
Seventeen in his body left the boy full
Of hollow tips so I know he won't be comin' back
I let my hair platt & let my mail stack
But my sweet sweet Sunday had to turn tart
His posse came & they triggas had no heart

Me kill all man say kill all man say
Kill 'em all man kill 'em all with me Glock Glock
Kill all man say kill all man say

Well it’s another one, in the gutter one, ghetto running em
Troublesome, extra double dumb, I come to beat em
Defeat em and mistreat em, so what if that I’m cheating
Now everybody wanna sound grimey (yeah I know)
I’ma show ya how, come on, all in together now
Yeah oh yeah yeah that’s how it gotta be
So stop trying to be loud as me cause you can't do that
Think about it; playing Russian roulette with an automatic
I bet my ass against the line the last bullet’s first on line
Stab and step and repping and run, packing a weapon is wild

Peace to the brothers on Rikers Isle
Tough enough and trembling, blend in like a chameleon

Of course, I come across with the pure for sure unadulterated uncut raw
Disgusted, busted, you wanna touch it, too hot
You forgot, you’re not ready, your head could get ruptured
Hit between the eyes, I plan to vandalize
I supply the static, I run with the bad guys
The villains, crooks, highlighters and the fighters
See the big black picture if you look inside of my mind
It’s graphic, expressed it drastic
So kill the copycat act kid, it’s all mastered
Directed it, when y'all least expected it
And thought it was safe, Onyx hit you in the face so SLAM

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
I’m a b-boy, standing in my b-boy stance
Hurry up and give me the microphone before I bust in my pants
The mad author of anguish, my language polluted
Onyx is heavyweight and still undisputed
You took the words right out my mouth now walk a mile in my shoes
I paid so many dues, I feel used and abused and I’m so confused
*hiccup* Excuse me, for example I’m an inspiration of a whole generation
And unless you got ten sticky fingers it’s an imitation
A figment of your imagination
Bu-bu-bu-but wait it gets worse
I’m not watered down so I’m dying of thirst
Coming through with a scam, foolproof plan
B-boys make some noise, and just, just SLAM

I hear dem talking, but I don’t know what dem tin kin’
This ain’t a song about me being fly
It’s a song about me, myself, and I
You know this I
Persist, and refuse to get jammed
People try to [?] flam, but every song that I make slam
Like Abe Lincoln, they wanna see me dead, stinkin'
I’m not sinkin', so [?] how ya thinkin'
I’m rising, rising at a rapid rate
And at my weight, I’m gonna wax the whole damn state
And every step I take
It’s a step in the struggle
And everything I got, ay yo I got it on the juggle
Nobody gave me nothing see I fought my way
That’s why I’m proud to say that I’m the Positive K (that’s right)
From Robin Givens down to Michael Bivins
What I’m saying is, everybody gotta make a living
Come on

[Intro]
Hah, yeah
Hell yeah
Hah, know what I'm saying?
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Mista Busta, where the fuck you at?
Can't scrap a lick, so I know you got your gat
Your dick on hard, from fuckin' your road dogs
The hoods you threw up with, niggas you grew up with
Don't even respect your ass
That's why it's time for the doctor to check your ass, nigga
Used to be my homie, used to be my ace
Now I wanna slap the taste out ya mouth
Make ya bow down to the Row
Fuckin' me, now I'm fuckin' you, little ho
Oh, don't think I forgot, let you slide
Let me ride, just another homicide
Yeah, it's me so I'mma talk on
Stomping on the Eazy-est streets that you can't walk on
So strap on your Compton hat, your locs
And watch your back cause you might get smoked, loc
And pass the bud and stay low-key
B.G. cause you lost all your homie's love
Now call it what you want to
You fucked with me, now it's a must that I fuck with you

[Interlude]
Yeah, that's what the fuck I'm talkin' about
We have your mothafuckin' record company surrounded
Put down the candy and let the little boy go
You know what I'm sayin? Punk motherfucker
(We want Eazy! We want Eazy!)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
Doggy Dogg's in the motherfuckin' house
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
Death Row's in the motherfuckin house
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
The sounds of a dog brings me to another day
Play with my bone, would ya Timmy?
It seems like you're good for making jokes about your jimmy
But here's a jimmy joke about your momma that you might not like
I heard she was the 'Frisco dyke
But fuck your mama, I'm talking about you and me
Toe to toe, Tim M-U-T
Your bark was loud but your bite wasn't vicious
And them rhymes you were kicking were quite bootylicious
You get with Doggy Dogg ""oh is he crazy?""
With your mama and your daddy hollering ""Baby!""
So won't they let you know
That if you fuck with Dre, nigga you're fuckin' wit Death Row
And I ain't even slanging them thangs
I'm hollering 187 with my dick in your mouth, beyotch

[Interlude: RBX]
Yeah nigga, Compton and Long Beach together on this motherfucker
So you wanna pop that shit, get your motherfuckin cranium cracked nigga
Step on up
Now, we ain't no motherfuckin joke so remember the name
Mighty, mighty D-R
Yeah, motherfucker

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre + Snoop Dogg]
Now understand this: my nigga Dre can't be touched
Luke's bending over so Luke's getting fucked, buster
Must've thought I was sleazy
Or thought I was a mark cause I used to hang with Eazy
Animosity made you speak what you spoke
Ayo Dre
Whattup?
Check this nigga off, loc
If it ain't another ho that I gots to fuck with
Gap teeth in your mouth so my dick's gots to fit
With my nuts on your tonsils
While you're onstage rapping at your wack-ass concert
And I'mma snatch your ass from the backside
To show you how Death Row pull off that hoo-ride
Now you might not understand me
Cause I'mma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
Then we gonna creep to South Central
On a street knowledge mission as I steps in the temple
Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat
You trying to check my homie, you better check yourself
Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself, motherfucker
Yeah, nigga

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, nine-deuce
Dr. Dre, dropping chronic once again
It don't stop: punishing punk motherfuckers real quick like
Doggy Dogg in the motherfuckin house
Long Beach in the motherfuckin house
Compton style nigga, straight up, really tho
Breaking all you suckas off something real proper like
You know what I'm sayin?
All these sucka ass niggas can eat a fat dick

It's the hard little pistol-packing punk dope smuggler
Lethal when I kill, I go straight for the jugular
Back again to hit ya with the junkyard funk
Shit gets out of hand, I got a Tec in the trunk
Let's flip the ill shit kid, yo he looped it
Hardcore, straight to make you brothers act stupid
Now I'm on a rampage, prepare for the slaughter
Lyrical monster busting nuts in your daughter
Slaying competition is the real beat digger
(Clank) Hit you with a shovel now you're dead, nigga
Freaking the funk, I be the ill funk freaker
With the diabolical sound coming through your speaker
Bulletproof ready for action, no fronting
Fully loaded Tec, chump, ready to go hunting
So sleep and watch me let off and catch wreck
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec""

When I pop the trunk, hit the deck
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec""
Head for the hills before you get wrecked
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec"" (Repeat 2x)

[Psycho Les]
Here I come up your block, drivin' drunk
Smoking skunk, waiting for a fucking punk
To beef, so he can get killed by the psycho thief
Retarded like Biz, eating cats like Heath-
Cliff, light the spliff, crack the quart and
If I kill you first nigga, be a good sport and
Die, don't give me no hassle
I snatch up your bitch, take her to White Castle
To crack her asshole, so I can fuck her
Hit that doo doo brown, then buck her
The crazy rapist smelling like much vaginas
Carjacking punks, pulling 'em out they Pathfinders
It makes me want to scream, but I just chill
By the end of the week, how many punks must I kill?
I'm sticking up picnics, I'm robbing 'em good so after dark
Stay the fuck out the woods (You fucking punk!)

When I pop the trunk, hit the deck
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec""
Head for the hills before you get wrecked
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec"" (Repeat 2x)

[Psycho Les]
Come on girl, don't give me that shit
Blast my nine to your spine, take your money then split
Audi, now your ass is ghost to me
Beatnuts on the mix sticking Hindu grocery shops
So what's up hops?
I shoot you with no problem, I'm used to shooting cops
I'll let you go this time, but next time you pop
That shit, your ass gets dropped

[JuJu]
Yo, it's the gun-slinging lunatic demons outta hell
Intoxicated punks letting off bad smell
Beatnuts forever, die hard motherfuckers
Low-key deadly, taking out all suckers
Before you even step and try to play me, son
Bring heavy ammunition so you don't have to run
Take heed, this ain't something you should laugh to
Yo I'll shoot your moms if I have to

When I pop the trunk, hit the deck
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec""
Head for the hills before you get wrecked
""John Wayne couldn't even stand the reign of the Tec"" (Repeat 2x)

Yeah, this is Colorado from Shadz of Lingo
Kickin it with the Funklord himself, E Double
Hittin' switches, and we bout to get stupid
So you know, yo E, check it

[Erick Sermon]
Ah yeah one two, hey young world, hey young world (""It's on!"")
Mic check, here I go again, check me out
Bust the flavor (""heYYYYYyyyy"") you know my clout
Rough and rugged -- funk's the contact I hit you with
To make your head split, trip and do a backflip
I swing it hardcore like an orangutang
I bring it wicked, and freak the funk slang
Like god damn, yea dude gnarly, fuckin A
I don't Play-Doh, my nickname ain't Clay
It's the E Double, mackaframa, bust the grammar
My style is sickening, like Roseanne-ah
Plus, I'm funky like _Atomic Dog_
Boy you can't see me, I'm thicker than fog, so
Save that drama, here's a floppy disk don't risk it
Boo-yaa, that's my biscuit!
On the mic, I cover every angle
A square, tri-part to a rectangle
I mean dat wit a passion, so be it
When I rock the mic it's worth seein
So cop a squad and parlay bitch
With the E-R-I-C-K, while I'm hittin' switches

[Chorus: Erick Sermon x2]

Off and on, off and on, it's on [x4]
Hittin' switches!

[Erick Sermon]
Ah shit, it's part two, it's on with the funk so
RING THE ALARM, ding! While I drop the bomb
On the country, E's gettin funky word to mother
I smother, any emcee or so-called brother
Why? I gets busy, who the hell is he?
The roughneck from New York City
You wanna mess around with the ill bastard
Then get your ass kicked, messin with the click
Def Squad, now on location, with the funky sensation
You wanna step you must be freebasin
Punk, why you playin, you bored?
You can't afford, to get choked by the mic cord
I keep you drunk like whiskey, solve the mystery
Ummmm, without Agatha Christie (there we go)
You think you know _What's Going On_
Without Marvin Gaye around, c'mon let's get down
I spark your brain with all funk material
And gettin wicked, and let Wilson Pickett
Before I break, let me announce - get the bozack
Now we all can bounce, as I'm hittin' switches

[Chorus]

[Erick Sermon]
(Switch) Back in effect mode, droppin loads
Watch me explode with the devil in me like crossroads
And ding-a-ling-a-ling with the guitar, freak the funk speech
Make the contact strong as bleach
Rock the mic make the vibes right, and plus dy-no-mite
So I can fly high like Mike and ""Just Do It""
And get freaky-deaky on the real, grab the steel
In case there's caps to peel
In the mix, when I flex the context, beware
Like when you're havin safe sex
I continue to get brand new, one two
My mic held tight, so I can recite the hype
And get busy, my name is Erick Sermon
Back for the Adventure, without Pee-Wee Herman
For those who don't know, don't act suspicious
While I'm hittin' switches

I got a hold of the mic like a vice grip
I got a vision, but it's different than Mariah's
I wanna hear you pumpin in pile drivers
No matter what kinda speakers you got
I know the Fostex amp is gettin hot
The bass knocks hard just like the police
And the fans eat it up like a fuckin feast

I got the rhymes when the situation's critical
Yeah, the B-L-V-D, turn up the V-O-L-U-M-E

You broke your ass off a funky beat, made just for the cause

Don't front, we know you're liking sounds loud, G
And our shit ain't made for no sissies
Got the street beat I know ya been waiting for

So when you're rolling, G, in your funky fresh car

Humps for the boulevard

Take a hit, blow it out, then you pass it back
You got the bomb shit, so you're really feelin it
You bought a 40 and your homie is killin it
Roll down the windows, comin up are some hoochies
Your homie's ugly, so he can't pop the coochie
You're laughin at your homeboy cuz he got dissed
He's on tip, and you know that he's gettin pissed
Stop at the store, cuz my boys got the munchies
You're rolling deep and your ride's gettin funky
Ain't no thang, pile up back in the car
Keep it going fool, humps for the boulevard

By the waistline, kickin the hype shit
I never claim to be the best type of rapper
But have to, show them motherfuckers what I'm after
I'm after the gold, then after that the platinum
Beef after that, Hurricane G packs the gat son
Trigger, bang, bang, yo bust the slang, whut my name?
It's the Redman on the funk train
Psyche, you're motherfuckin right, tonight's the night
To do what I wanna do, to do it like dynamite
The work perfected, when the funk been injected
I roughen up the rough draft to like make your head split
Punk! Pass the 40 and the blunt and don't front
On the block, cause when you do front, brothers are gettin stomped
I'm not a addict, more like puff than magic
Then pass it when I'm through cause my crew gots to have it
I don't claim to be a big rap star
Cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar
So listen up and take heed to what I'm sayin
Cause tonight's the night and me and my niggas ain't playin'

Fat black bitch! Nasty
Bush bear, booga breath bitch
Nasty, talk to your tits bitch
With them nasty Africans, Mr. Bojangles
Turned up shoes havin ass
Lemming leprechaun haircut motherfucker!

You wanna see me get cool, please, save it for the breeze
Cause the lyrics and tracks, make me funky like cottage cheese
Fuck the smooth shit, I get down wit the boom bip
Like Q-Tip, I kick more styles than Bruce shoe's kick
But tonight's the night what I write tonight
This type of funk with the flavor like Mike 'n' Ike's
Hanging out wit my niggas, my niggas
The Pack Pistol Posse keep they fingers on the triggers
I keep the 40 between my lap, coolin, rollin down the highway
Blunt system pumps cause it's Friday
Roll over to pick my boys up, we raise a lot of noise
Cause, we can do that black, so ""Get the Bozack"" Jack
Remember, I do the type of evil that men do
Like cursin out my window at a bitch and her friend too
So turn the volume up a notch
And watch the ba-BUMP, ba-BUMP, make ya speakers pop
That's the funk, when it pumps it makes your rump
Jump, jump, jump.. jump, jump, jump
But if you want to see a fly but frantic
Cool romantic, more slicker than my man Rick
You better check the Yellow Pages under smooth shit
Cause Red ain't down for the bullshit
Niggas fucked up by letting me make an album (How come rude boy?)
To get on the mic and let my fuckin style run

Nasty fuckin greenthumb Jolly Green niggas
Tango mango, pickin havin ass
Nasty epileptic disease crazy havin ass
Johnny Cash, afro havin
Jack of Spades, boots havin
Tony Danza, shoes wearin ass!

Gotta what yo
Gotta get a ruffneck Hey!

[Verse 1]
I need a ruffneck
I need a dude with a attitude
Only needs his fingers with his food
Karl Kani saggin' timbos draggin'
Frontin' in his ride with his home boys braggin'
Lying 'bout the Lyte how he knocked boots last night
But he's a ruffneck so that's alright
Triple o baldie under the hood
Makin' noise with the boys up to no good
C-low on the down low cops come around so ruffneck front like he gotta go
Evil grin with a mouth full of gold teeth
Startin' beef is how he spells relief
Actin' like he don't care
But all I gotta do is beep him 911 and he'll be there
Right by my side with his ruffneck tactics
Ruffneck attitude,the ruffneck bastard

[Hook]
Hey! Gotta what?
Yo gotta get a ruffneck (x3)
I need it and I want it
So I gotta get a ruffneck!


[Verse 2]
I need a ruffneck
I need a man that's quick and swift
To put out the spliff and get stiff
Boxer shorts everything is fitting large
Body ain't gotta be large to be in charge
Pumpin' in and out and out and in and here we go
He knows exactly how I want my flow and that's slow
Never questioning can he get buck wild
He's gotta smack it,lick it,swallow it up style
Drink a beer ,sittin' his chair
Hands in his pants fiddlin' with his dick hairs
He's a rudeboy,a raggamuf
Ready to bag another brother that he ranks not ruff enough
Cause if it ain't ruff it ain't right
And if he ain't ruff,well then he's all wrong for the Lyte
I love my ruffneck and ain't nothing going down
Or going up if my ruffneck ain't in town

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I need a ruffneck
I need a man that don't snitch like a bitch
Shed tears or switch
Doin' whatever it takes to make ends meet
But never meetin' the end cause he knows the street
Eat sleep shit fuck,eat sleep shit
Then it's back to the streets to make a buck quick
Quick to beg even though gimme gottem here
Hit'em wit a bit a skins then he's out of there
On the avenue girls are passin' thru
Too much of ruffneck so they ain't havin' you
Hard boppin' always grabbin' his jock and braggin' about his tec
Is the wannabe ruffneck
That's the kind you gotta watch out for
Just to get a rep he'll pull the plug on the tour
Pissin' in corners
Doing 80 by funeral mourners
Showing little respect
Now that's a ruffneck!

[Verse 3: B-Real]
Like Louie Armstrong, played the trumpet
I'll hit that bong and break you off something
Soon I got to get my props
Cops, come and try to snatch my crops
These pigs wanna blow my house down
Head underground to the next town
They get mad when they come to raid my pad
And I'm out in the nine-deuce Cad'
Yes I'm the pirate, pilot
Of this ship if I get with the ultraviolet dream
Hide from the red light beam
Now do you believe in the unseen?
Look, but don't make you eyes strain
A nigga like me is going insane

[Hook: B-Real & Sen Dog]
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Crazy insane, got no brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!

{​*Lord Jazz cuts and scratches 'Chief Rocka'*}​

[Verse 1: Mr. Funkee]
Boom shaka laka yo here comes the Chief Rocka
Rock it down, so jump up off the tip you're not my nucca
For sharper type to battle make the people say ooh ahh
Think I won't curse, I'll break down and say puta
?Hey, madrigon, sesa me bichafi mi chocha?
Say what I want because, I'm that type of guy
Now fam-a-lam, I'll be damned, slam jams the weak
Could it be the skunk weed that makes us oh so funky?
Now hold it let me choose, couldn't be the booze
No it's the shoes (the shoes?) It's gotta be the shoes!
Cause girlies, they clock, they stand around and jock
So I say boom shaka lak, grab the microphone then rock
To tell you the truth, when on the mic
I'll say anything that sounds good
Like ""drum pan, a drum pan sound over some uuuuh""
The Cat in the Hat and the mouse ran up the stairs
""That doesn't make no sense!""
C'mon who cares?
See even without the gift there's yours so don't be tryin to knock me
I say what I want to say, as long it sounds funky
Some MC's wanted to buy me, so they try to take stands
But they don't understand
I'm the motherfuckin man
I amaze and astound, rhythm up and down
Smack a group of them around
Let them know who wears the crown
Who's-the-tip-of-the-top, the-cream-of-the-crop, the-best-under-the-sun
I'm the Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Mr. Funkee

[Hook x8]
{​*Lord Jazz cuts 'The Lord Chief Rocka, number one, Chief Rocka'*}​

[Verse 2: DoItAll]
Well umm, boom, shak-a-lak, I got the fragrance, the funk
Whew and it's smellin' up the hip-hop
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
Mixed a, little of this, and now I gotta rap
I'm the, Chief Rocka so I guess I am in charge
I freak it with a twist so you'll boom it in your cars
I'm the, one with the flow and the grip like G.I. Joe
I snatch, I grab and then I grab the dough
See if I was an Indian I'd still be the chief
The only other difference I'd smoke weed in a leaf
To the hip, the hop, to the hibby to the hibbidy
Hip-hop, oh no, I don't wanna go pop
I got, too much soul, rhythm and blues
R&B ya see, all that's cool but
Hip-hop and rap yeah that's where my heart's at
Even back when I used to break on a box
Backspins for backspin, even while I'm rappin'
Before I had a record, I always kept em clappin'
Freestylin on the block, now I Chief Rock
I always entertain, by diggin' in my crux
My brain, so if it's gonna rain let it rain
I spook you with the hit
Make you jump like House of Pain
Boogaloo boogaloo, shake and jump
And remember, remember, Chief Rocka won't front

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3: DoItAll, Mr. Funkee]
[DIA] Ay Mr. Funkee
[MrF] Whassup?
[DIA] Can I get assistance?
[MrF] For what?
[DIA] For what? Yo Jazz, flex a cut
Well back is the backer, I'm chillin' with my nucca
And if ya got beef, then you can live with Jimmy Hoffa like
[Duo] what goes up, must come down
[DIA] But not me clown
I cut 'em, crack a speaker when I'm pumpin'
So jump in, and watch your ears start hummin'
Through the block, and don't forget to boom shak shak-a-lak

[Verse 4: Mr. Funkee]
Well damn DoItAll can I rock?
I hear a beat I grab the mic, and then I start this workin'
The kids around the way used to think that I was buggin'
But they don't understand how I feel about the funk
I walk with the funk, I talk with the funk
I eat with the funk, I sleep with the funk
I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk
So now what do they say, when I'm walkin up the block
Boom-shaka-laka there goes the Chief Rocka

Yo V, bring it in
Aight, this this a special dedication
To my man DJ Hollywood
Because he was one of the first ones out there
And I-I-I'd like I'd like to sing a little song
A little something like this
To all the ladies out there, this goes out to you now
Check it out

[Verse One: Biz singing]
Ooooh, whoa-whoa
No wayyyyyyyyy, no wayyyyyyyy
For you to stop me now
I'm the kind of guy that could really turn you on
Give you so much lovin, and treat you on
Just hold me close and hold me tight
And let's make love tonight
And I swear to you baby, I'll treat you right
If you're the kind of girl that I've been lookin for
Be real good to me baby, let me be adored
I don't stop the way I'm feelin
Just keep on turnin me on
And I swear to you baby, I'll love you all night long

[Interlude One]
Somebody say well (well) - WELLLLL! (WELLLLL!)
There ain't no way to stop me now, come on
Let me here you say welll (welll) - oh well (oh well)
WELLLLLLL-LLLLLLLL-LLLLLLL

[Verse Two: Biz singing]
Did you ever see a girl, and thought she didn't care
Did you ever feel like cryin, and think you'd get nowhere
Did you ever see her comin, when the lights were down below
Did you ever whisper GOD I LOVE HER, but how much you never know
Did you ever look into her eyes and see a little prayer
Could you sew a spot, flow to her heart
And think that you were there?
Did you ever wonder where she is, or wonder if she's true?
One day you'll be happy
But that next day you'll be blue

[Chorus]
That's why I say well (well) - it feels so good to me
WELLLLL (WELLLLL) - you know just how to set me FREEEEEEE
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
LET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh

Whenever I see her face (where you goin brotherman?)
I take a trip to a beautiful plaaaaaaaaace
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
LET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh

[Interlude Two]
Whenever we're up close
It's your perfume I love the mooooooooooost
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
LET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh

[Verse Three: Biz singing]
When all the other fellas try to run that game on you
I wanna show you baby a love that's true
A love that's good, and a love that's fine
Somethin to blow your mind
Talkin bout a love of the freakiest kind
Because you got eyes like a-water
Lips so rosey red
Everytime I see you really turns my head
And I'm the kind of guy, that love you all for me
And everybody know my name is (BIZ-MAR-KIE)

[Chorus]

[Biz singing]
Say, well, WELLLLLLLLLLLL
Well, well well welll
Well, well, well!
Let me let me turn you on, ooooooooohhhhh
Let me.. let me turn you on
Please baby, let me turn you on
Welll welll welll welll welll welll
Let me let me turn you on, ooooooooohhhhh
Yeah, yeahhhhh

[Intro: 2Pac]
Aw, yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground
When we come around
Stronger than ever

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Back to get wreck, all respect
To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
‘Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me
She squeeze me—lady, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem, saying ""bye-bye""
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask ""Why?"", don't matter! My pockets got fatter
Now everybody's lookin' for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out: I get around

[Hook]
What you mean you don't know? I get around
The Underground just don't stop for hoes, I get around
Still down with the Underground, I get around
Yeah, ayo, Shock, let them hoes know!

[Verse 2: Shock G]
Now you can tell from my everday fits I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix
Tryin' to make a dollar out of 15 cents (A dime and a nickel)
Just ‘cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby, I can see that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G: the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me; I get around

[Verse 3: Money B]
What's up, love? How you doin'?
Well, I've been hangin', sangin', tryin' to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was bangin'
Your homegirl you went to school with?
That's cool, but did she tell you about her sister?
And your cousin thought I wasn't
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low
Long as you know that I get around

[Hook]

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
Finger tips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip; loose lips sink ships
It's a trip, I love the way she licks her lips, see me jockin'
Put a little twist in her hips ‘cause I'm watchin'
Conversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn
Now we're all alone: why the lights on?
Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Somethin' is on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well, if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweatin' me?
It's a lot of real G's doin' time
‘Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
‘Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll, are you down? I get around

[Verse 1:]
I got a job with the mob, makin G's
Doin some pickups, deliveries and transportin keys
Yeah they got me like a flunky
I'm ridin around with ten kilos inside my trunk G
And I'm holdin the suitcase
With a half a million dollars right in my motherfuckin face
And I'm tryin to ignore it
But sometimes I get tempted to make a motherfuckin run for it
The thought alone makes me shiver, damn
What if I get caught? They'll find me floatin in the Hudson river
But if I escape, I'll be in shape for my life
But they might, get my kid and my wife
See I'm supposed to make a stop
To an Uptown spot, run up the block and make another drop
But I got somethin else in mind
Cause I'm sick of puttin my motherfuckin ass on the line
I got the money and the hit
Went through the Brook nonstop cause I ain't droppin off shit
Then I thought of a plan
So I droves to my house and got my girl and my little man
C'mon bitch, pack the shit, get ready
""God damn why your face all sweaty?""
Just hurry up and get the shit
I'm a dead man, bitch. Understand? We gotta split!
I switched the locks on the door
Started packin like I was goin on a motherfuckin world tour
Grabbed my bags and my gun
C'mon we gotta go... I'm on the motherfuckin run

[Verse 2:]

Now I'm drivin and I'm lookin at my passport
I'm outta here soon as my ass hit the airport
I loaded up the automatic
I don't believe this shit, I'm stuck in motherfuckin traffic
I'm gettin nervous as a fuck see
A Lincoln Continental pullin right up beside me
Puts down my bitch and then I bent low
*gunfire, breaking glass* Bullets are flying through my window
The enemy is on attack
Drew the nine and cocked the hammer and I fired at the bitches back
I gotta take my respect
My bullets hittin italian motherfuckers in the neck
Looked at my bitch a bullet struck her
Put in another clip, cause I ain't givin up a motherfucker
Niggas runnin up in trenches
Sprayin at my car, only missin me by fuckin inches
Stepped on the gas pedal, how bad my bitch is harmed?
Shit they only hit her in the fuckin arm
Now I'm drivin off sidewalks, makin sharp turns
My son is catchin motherfuckin heartburns
I got the car shakin wildly
I made a turn, and then I dipped my shit into a dark alley
They drove right past, now all this chasin shit is done
I'm on the motherfuckin run

[Verse 3:]

The next thing I know, it was daylight
And I been sleepin in this motherfucker all night
I started pullin on my ho
""C'mon, man, what?"" Wake up bitch, we gotta go!
Pulled out the alley, then I dipped
Looked down and picked up the nine and put more rounds in the clip
You know I'm headin South no doubt
And I don't give a fuck where, as long it's a hideout
Finally we crossed the border, I pulled into a station
To fill up the tank, and get a drink of water
Pullin over to park my ride
That's when I noticed this limousine comin up on my left side
Then the sucker started rammin me
Then I looked, it was the Luciano family
Looked at my bitch she started cryin, my finger on the trigger
I pulled it—bullets started flyin
Now I'm hittin all them bastards
I'm droppin em fast, splashin blood out niggas' asses
Then I'm finally done and
I took em all out, but I caught one in the stomach
Now I'm lookin for survivors
So I ran up on the side of the car, and hit the driver
And then I laid low
The only motherfucker left was Don Luciano
So I snuck up the sucker
Put my gun to his head, ""Whassup now motherfucker?""
He said, ""Wait, I want to talk""
*five gunshots* I put his brains on the sidewalk
Another life I had to waste
He fell on his back, and then I spit right in his guinea face
He saw the barrel of the devil's gun
Now I'm no longer on the motherfuckin run

(Oh, that's the way it is?)
Fuck yeah and that's the way it's gonna be
(Why), puffin up on tha dank and drinking mad brew
Taking names and after that I'm kickin ass too
Breed, time to flow (can I get a rhyme to go)
Hell yeah, Pac, I'll sit back, straight up design it slow
They hate to see a young nigga, (come up)
Another punk, (run up) and have to get his, (gun up)
Cause um I ain't takin no shots
Like a Newport fort, exploitin the floor like Jordan
Explodin on the hoop court.
And I don't wanna be, I-don't-wanna-be nuttin like Mike
Cause even Mike was like it's a itsy bit triflin
And when you in the spotlight, you get um jocked right
But your knot's not tight
Buckin anybody who fuck wit' mine
When will they realize? I'm straight out to get mine

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
Finger on the trigger, nigga, hand on my 9
Smokin' blunts a skunk, making holes in punks
And only underground funk pumpin' outta my trunk
Live the life of a hustler, high 'til I die
Meeting bitches, getting riches, miss me with lies
Picture me living out my life as a busta
I'd rather pop out a shot from my Glock and blast mothafuckas
I live the thug life, baby, I'm hopeless
Chokin' off indo, tryin' to keep my focus
Don't let that bullshit worry me
Fuck the fame, I'm true to the game 'til they bury me
God gave me game, so I'm hustlin'
Pour out some liqour for my niggas, 2Pac is still strugglin'
My nigga Breed knew the time
Whether it's rhyme or crime, nigga, I gotta get mine

[Hook]


[Verse 3: MC Breed]
Now, tell me
Can you measure the amount of applause I keep gettin?
Everytime I pick up a mic and start spittin
The sidewalks of New York will start bumpin
Jumpin around, with the motherfuckin pound
And I'm down to the fullest, and breakin niggas ass off proper
Did I shock you, cause I got you in my pocket again
Them new jacks and you jacks
Who knew me and my niggas, when I used to run it way back when
I boasted, and roasted, and coasted to the pinnacle
Because of what I do with a pen
It's vernacular precision
Connect the two lines and it's division
Plus, when I add lutes and flutes
It's guaranteed to sell like prostitutes
I never had love for hoes who put it blunt
And want me in the back, but, bitch, I'm in the front!
Don't front, and really I don't need a reply
Pull yourself together as you pass me by
I'm on a whole another level, them hoes is left
I told you before, keep ya pussy to yourself
Goodbye, some many niggas lied to have
Funny what a motherfucker do for math
I got fractions caught up in my everday actions
Point equal to your real satisfaction
Buckin anybody who fuck wit' mine
When will they realize, I'm straight out to get mine haha

I trust that courtesy when dealing with folks is too much for the asking
Cool: I got the skill crafted tools
Massive fools at my work bench and
I'm wrenchin' mics from they grasp 'n'
That's how it has been
The drill's this: I kill swift
I feels I better slay or, hey
My tape measures greater
So now I'm askin' dips if they saw me and they was available
Would they want me to nail'em all?
Be through, screw, drive her crazy; nut and bolt, lively

Figure I kick stunts; I punch twice that nigga that's dissin' at me
Attach'em to bats, latchin', and matchin' my cataclysm

So why flow if you're not invigorating?
I know where you live; There at your crib, I got niggas waitin'
I figure raping is crime, see
I take my time B, and now your G is my G
Now I'm gonna show you how the west coast smacks kids
Yo, I'm rhyming swell, so the hell with a wack dis
Generalizing, dissing before you've ever seen this
So you can get the middle (What middle?)
The penis

Never the match the miraculous tactics
I smack tricks, the wax is at your wack bitch
I crack bricks over dicks
Who can't come, I leave'm broke and dumb
Def, and plus I'm causin' cardiac arrest, you need some rest
Check, as I'm chiselin' riddles in your memory
Remember me? I hacked your body to pieces disassembling your flows
You bros started trembling from shock and trauma
I'm gonna, end lives when I bomb a

How it goes..

We want your mind to blow, baby

Let me roooooooooooooll..

Just let us hang with you

Hangin in the hood, just shootin the breeze
My partners on the cut smokin swisher sweets
Trippin on the hoochies rollin by in they rides
Guzzlin up a forty ounce of cold St. Ides
Jammin to a tape to my partner had made
'Growin' up in the Hood' bein mixed with Face
Swisher sweet's a killer, feelin nothin but nice
Reached in my pocket for the old school dice
Pulled out a knot and dropped the dice on the flo'
And asked my partner Mike what they hittin fo'
Pulled out a yard and said, ""We bettin a dove""
Tee Lee Baby, show your partner some love
Kickin back fadin, put the flame to the joint
3-2, drop baby, 3-2's your point
Back in the do' with a fo' and a ace
Picked up his ends and waved the dice in my face
And then he hollered out ""School house!""
Schooled em again, now d's come in ounce
And walked away from the crap game broke
But it ain't no thing, yo - just let a brother smoke

Let me roooooooooooooll..
We want your mind to blooooow
Just got some things to do

[ VERSE 2 ]
Back on the creep after losin some change
Seen my partner [Name], Big Chief and James
Creepin on the boulevard, actin a fool
Trippin on the broads at the old school
Music bumpin hard, never turnin it down
Trunk super tight with surround-by sound
Paint job crackin cause the punch ain't fade
Jammin that brand new 2Low tape
Windows all smokey, blowin coke-laced seed
I'm throwin up the deuce to the HPD
Now they lookin crazy like I sold the hay
Just another day in the heart of S.A
Roll a little further there, I seen O.G
With his brother named [Name], S.A. O.G
They chopped up the hood, so I'm chunkin it back
And then they pulled out a $200 sack
When I saw it I almost choked
Twist your partner one, big baby, just let your partner smoke

Let me roooooooooooooll..
We want your mind to blooooow
We got some things to do

Smokin on some lovely, now I'm feelin fine
It's jumpin off at the 9.9
5th Ward in the house with the S.A. fools
Ain't no set trippin cause we all so cool
Drinkin up the bottle, gettin drunk as a skunk
That 151 just ain't no punk
Hit the stage and grabbed the mic and started flexin styles
A stage full of tight MC's goin buckwild
Now throw your hands in the air like that
On the wheels of steel is my homie Lonnie Mack
Gettin down on his own
Now I'm finna pass my partner Jay the microphone

Throw your hands in the air like that

As Mista Grimm raps over laps, don't say shit
Just, listen and recline for a spell
Pass the fat spliff back and forth (oh yeah)
Stuck, unable to breathe through the Chronic
Cloud that somehow prevents me from installin' fresh air

[Verse 2: Warren G]
Ahh, Indosmoke
Pass me the joint so I can take a toke
1 puff, 2 puff, 3 puff, 4 puff, 5 I'm feelin real high
Lean into the side in my muthafuckin' ride
With the O.G. gangsta glide
Woo!, hey now ya know
Inhale, exhale with my flow
Breakaway, come again like this
The LB to the C two times, don't miss
Cuz if you do, you break you get broke
Me and Mista G and the Indo Smoke

[Hook: Nate Dogg (x2)]
(Are you high yet?)
Whatever you do muthafucka you betta not choke
This ain't no stress, it's the muthafuckin' indo smoke

[Verse 3: Mista Grimm]
Fee, fi, foe, really doe
I'm still smokin' and sippin', talkin' like a pimp
Freakin', seekin' new lands without transport
Cuz indo smoke is a man's sport
I never feel stressed and that's the realist
Just a proper herb for my chronic illness
Please, let me go on with my day
Relax with phat tracks and a real fat J
Ooh, I think I'm in love
Astounded from what it did, sended me far above
On a fly toke, I can brag for days
You can't swim with Grimm
Because my tidal wave's - high
And that's no joke
Because Mista Grimm takes flight from the Indo Smoke

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 4: Mista Grimm]
Ignition to remission, blast off through the cos
Most of the voyage I enjoy is just a cause
I sonic boom when I return back to earth
Birth of a new rhyme will take no time
I'm prepared, papers and a lighter to provoke
A comical scene to watch Mista Grimm choke
Then gain composure, compose a symphony
From C-H-R-O-N-I-C and Mista G mixed together nicely
Combinin', lick the linings, voilà!
A fat Chronic sack you can put in your jaw
H and R puff the stuff in ya lungs
Smokin' on the Chronic, gettin' straight sprung
Stretched, taken to the extreme feelin'
Dancin' on the ceilin' like Lionel
If ya hear me on some vinyl
I break 'em till they can't be broke
As I soak, in the Indo Smoke

[Hook Outro: Nate Dogg]
[Are you high yet? (repeated in background)]
Take a trip with Nate Dogg to the Eastside
We will show you whether our gangstas love to get high
We get high on every street in Long Beach
So don't come to my hood thinkin' that you can save me
Niggas from funny land wanna come to the East and reveal
I gotta viscious left hook and you're damn right I will steal
Shots go out to my nigga Mista Grimm and you know Warren G
I gotta nigga named Gangsta Rod, you know B-Tip, you know me
My name is Nate D-O double G and I'm comin' straight from the East
Don't think you don't know where I'm from, I'm from 213

You gotta flow Joe, you gotta flow Joe
You gotta gotta gotta gotta let em know Joe

[Verse 1:Fat Joe]
Bust it, check it, watch how I wreck it
Niggas watch your back, shit is gettin hectic
I catch vibes like Count Basie, sucker won't face me
I'm so much flavor you can taste me
I'm underground like a gutter
You never catch me - stutter, everybody knows that I'm butter
I'm not the man with sensitivity
The name is Fat Joe, the label's Relativity, huh
I chop a rapper like a meat cleaver
I'm burnin hot, people think I have a fever, check it
If niggas wanna front, then come widdit
If you're havin second thoughts, well then forget it, see
I dig in my crates, I don't per-pa-trates
I got shit sewn, like Billy Bathgate
Beware like Cocoa, yo I'm not a slow boat
Got so much dough I va-cate in Acapulco
Crazy as they come I'm not the one, we can do this
With the hands, or take it to the guns..
You know I can flow, the name is Fat Joe
I can flow, I can flow, I can flow

[Hook]

[Verse 2:Fat Joe]
Yeah, yeah
Everybody knows Fat Joe's in town
Nuff respect for the Boogie Down
I'm livin in the Bronx on an Ave called Trinity
My name rings bells, within the vicinity
Peace to the money makers always plottin mono
Together we gettin dough, just like Lucky Luciano
People always tell me, yo you're dope Joe
But I'm not a car, so I don't get gassed like Amoco
Never ate the paint, no I'm not a sucker
Never liked ball so to Hell with the Rucker
Always on my own never sweatin nobody
Warm up a crowd like a bottle of Bacardi
I can kick it this way, I can kick it thattaway
I kick a funky style, from New York to Piscataway
Suckers best scram
Now in ninety-three it's all about the Fat Man
Peace to Finesse, Showbiz and A.G
Gizmo, Little Hec', and Kool Mike-ski (say what?)
My crew from Uptown
And if you mess around, then you'll catch a beatdown
See I got this in a smash
If a rapper steps up, he'll get smoked
Like a blunt full of hash
My style of rap is legendary
Fuck with the man, then you'll end up in the cemetary
And that's word to Ma Duke
I never fake moves, I'll go out like a troop
So act like you know, the name is Fat Joe
I can flow, I can flow, I can flow

[Hook]

[Verse 3:Fat Joe]
Yeah
See I rip the mic if you put me to a test
Troop it gets so bad, I make you wanna wear a vest
Cause I'm too hot to handle
Knockin niggas out like Livingstone Bramble
Rappers come heavy, but yo I weigh a ton
I won't lose weight cause I'm not on the run
I'm on point like a sniper, hyper than the hyper
On the DL, overlooked by C-Cipher
Never get caught, I'm on top with my game
Flip a fat ride, there's no need for a train
Rappers come close, but they just can't make it
When it comes to the funk, you know I won't fake it
Peace to Serge, and my right hand Flex
And when I grab the mic nobody wants to rock next
The name is Fat Joe, cause Joe is livin Fat
Niggas gettin jealous cause I got a contract
But I don't sweat it, I know the style is raw
You can't compare me to a cornball
And you know I kick game like a hottie
Now in ninety-three, they should free John Gotti
If you step, battle and I'm gonna mash your toes
You know I got the flow

[ Hook: Black C ]
Don't give me no bammer weed
(Get with the program)
(Just smoke that dank)
We don't smoke that shit in the SFC (4X)

[ VERSE 1: Mr. Cee ]
3, 2, 1, comin in with a bang
It's 2 dark-skinned niggas, not a muthafuckin gang
Pimps with limps, never known as simps
We smoke dank, not the bammer shit
Damn, that bammer ain't no good
You might as well smoke some rolled up wood
And you laughed and said those rhymes was funny
But trip on the sense that I'm stressin, you punk-ass dummy
Get with the program
Can't you see bammer ain't nothin but a scam
False high, nothin but a untruth
A fib, or a everyday lie too
Dank is the claim to fame
Ain't it a gram that you seek to gain?
Once knew a girl named Brenda
Smokin that bammer was her everyday agenda
She used to laugh and giggle
Until Mr. Cee moved next to her building
I tried to get her but she acted kinda shy
So I shared my dank, I got her real high
She followed me up to her room (My NIGGA!!)
And for you bitches, honey boom, honey boom
We smoked mo' dank without a pause
And later that night I was in them drawers
See, Frisco niggas ain't no punks
Put guts in our way and they're gonna get bucked
Oh, Brenda's now hoeing in the Point
Couldn't handle the dank, the reason: bammer joints

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 2: Black C ]
Don't give me no bammer joint
It's the Black C, nigga, gettin straight to the point
I was chillin outside on a hot day
It was me and my niggas, just check what I say
Let's fade, let's go see the dank man
They'll fade if they is my friend
A few niggas pitched in
(Let's go to the store so I can get some gin)
Oh no, straight Hen-dog on mine
With a little dab of Coke and a nigga doin fine
So now we got a nitro
We up, yeah, let's go hit the indo
In four deep we creep
It's about to be a party in a 5.0 Jeep
Nigga straight checkin the mirror
One nigga in the back had a St. Ides beer
Urlin like fuck in my backseat
I made him buy five grams and clean up the mess, G
Straight Hen-dog with no chaser
Fuck that beer, ain't nothin greater
A-B, our name: C
And you gotta pause when you get to the D
D for dank, D for drank
But not D for the dough that's stackin my bank
There's only two things that I smoke:
A punk-ass nigga or a pipe full of indo
I like nothin but the real McCoy
Straight dank, fuck a bammer joint

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3: Black C ]
Is it gold, is it green, is it brown?
(No, it's Black C breaking them buds down)
Or should I say them indo clusters
Never want homegrown 'cause I'm a indo lover
Trip on the shit that I say
Or go take a trip to go get the shit
D to the A to the N to the K
(Niggas know what's up) So what more can I say?
If it's in a zag or a pipe
It's quite expensive, so you better smoke it right
Get a few niggas to fade
Find a cut, and just zurp in the shade
And like meat belongs to a meal
Grab a 40 with the dank cause it's time to get ill
It's better than crack cocaine
It ain't medicine, but it'll ease the pain
And if you find right you're in luck
That and the Ides got you amped as fuck
Now for the journey or quest
And creepin for some sex but don't forget the latex
Niggas like each other lesser and lesser
But on the dank tip let's come together
You call it herb, some call it sess
But if it's called bammer don't smoke that mess

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 4: Mr. Cee ]
Once again it's the muthafuckin Mr. Cee
From Harbor Road, gee
Just gimme a couple of zigzags
So I can roll a fat one and take a drag
Now I ain't got no time for playin'
I just wanna smoke my dank, and
Niggas always sayin' smoke that bammer
But what's that word by MC Hammer?
Shit, it ain't 'proper'
The nigga who sold it to ya gotcha
Straight up gaffled
Now you're looking confused, or should I say baffled
But don't let it kill ya
'Cause a Hunters Point nigga who sold it to ya
The smoke gets straight to the head
And next you're put head to bed
Then you start to dreamin, wonderin
You say to yourself (Damn, that dank was bumpin)
Ooh, ah, look at that hoe
But don't open that door and let the contact blow
Nigga say that while rollin in a ride at the same time
Listen to the bassline
By T.C
And my nigga named Black C
Poem like d-o-p-e
Sayin fresh rhymes for the RBL Posse
Expialidocious-califragilistic-super
Boy, I said it backwards, can I come smoother?
That's that dank shit
Time to pull another lick
RBL to the ninjas:
Our mission: to go and jack niggas
For their indo sacks, to be exact
We took it like straight macks
See, we got straight to the point
'Cause we don't smoke no bammer joints

How really gotta die before I really get fly?
Hittin all sides with the slides, and I'm leavin
Everybody's doomed, comin straight from the Legion

(Hey yo, this is Raydog
I'm not here right now
Just leave your name and your number
Out)
(Hey yo, Dog, man, this is Beef
My bro, what happened, man?
We ain't goin out like that
Yo, we gots the shit, man
Hey yo, I'ma call Tone
Then I get back with you, man
Out)
(Yo man, this is the second time I call you, man
Get up, man, get up)

[ VERSE 6: Raydog ]
Hey yo, I be a nigga that you never could figure
With a dog on his chest and a stolen Trooper's vest
I represent a pack of niggas that'll kill quick
Like that, so suckers better get the fuck back
I bet you thought the Dog would never get another turn
But I'm the flame-thrower, so muthafuckas burn
You probably thought RSO's deep, well, you're right
We'll hit you up somethin fierce in a gunfight

[ VERSE 7: Tangg The Juice ]
Hey yo, Tangg's the ruffneck with the Tec hangin out the window
When they sleep on the T, smoke em like the endo
Niggas'll know when I pull, the whole patrol drop pants
On your blocvk with the Glock, nigga, that might be yo ass
So yo, don't ever call a nigga lazy
Cause all the B.P.D. know we all crazy
Cause everyday up in my hood it be the season for squeezin
Trust me, we'll be comin out the muthafuckin Legion

[ VERSE 8: E-Devious ]
Yo, we the Legion, but they labelled us the gangbang thugs
Who do nothin more than shoot shit and sell drugs
Mad niggas who do a lotta cursin
Strapped down with automatics on they person
With attitudes like: 'I don't give a fuck about you
Cause you don't give a fuck about me, gee'
That's how it is, yo, shit don't never be right
That's why we cross a gun with a mic
So I ain't makin friends, so fuck sayin 'what up'
Cause I pull my pump, and then I blow your gut up
So watch it when you talk shit, cause if I flip
I be on some old _King Of New York_ shit
And ain't nothin nice about that
Cause my crew is much deeper than Top Cat's
Huh, I'm E-Devious, never leavin shit alone
Word to Doom, it's comin from the Legion, homes

Press your luck or buck another sucker just ducked
Ooh, whatcha gonna do (4X)

[D.M.C.]
A vain from my brain means I'm causin em pain
Comin rough with the stuff that's just a part of the game
The rhymes have been hard since the start of the jam
So I'mma pull my jammy out and I'mma murder the man
Bust a rap like a cap, put a hole in your soul
Take the trigger then you figured that I'm losin control
I go loco with the vocals, yo goes the chokehold
And I broke those pros with the dope flows
I slow rolls, NO I don't smoke those
Leave the blunts for the punks in front rows
I said mine, headline or deadline
You see redline, here comes your bedtime
I lay it down, lay it low
Now I'm off and runnin on some new rhyme flow
I flex break necks bust tecs mic checks son
Fill you full of lead and now get ready for the next one

Never let a punk get away with murder

Where you been your hand is sendin DOWN, can you really cope?
Forever makin and breakin it and cold wreckin it
As for my title it's vital, you're never TAKIN it
I throw a stand across the stage and you'll get BUCKED down
Like Kris-One said, I fly a head you better _Duck Down_
I sold good and then plenty like ? Charlie said
Like Mike I glove it you love it and now it's for my bread
It's goin down on the mound watch a nigga pitch
Bang your thang and hang your damn NECKS, now you gettin it
I see them go, and come, cause what they pumpin weak
And now I'm flippin the script and they can hardly speak
I buck a nut then run amuck all on a sucker COOL

[Threat]
The great L.A. Zoo rip the roof off this mother
Suckers stand back, fathers swear they hard
Big black boots, let the dogs loose
Woof, woof, woof, woof!
Not just 3-D, funky like a fat sack of chronic
At rap so make your woofers crack
Pull guns then roses, clubs, closes now
Cause we shut this motherfucker down
See a fight, a fight, a nigga and a white
Got snatched out his truck but now he's alright
That's all I can say, better him than me
Jack and reportin, snatchin big (?) quotas
The media, made it, gang related
But if your momma woulda got it then a homicide
Get ready for a stand cause shit done hit the fan
Oh what a bummer - another crazy ass summer
Call they bluff, cause they don't have enough
Handcuffs, to serve us
And next time it jump off, no squealin
Just kill and let the dogs loose
Then reach for the ceiling

{*dogs barking*}

[Threat]
Fuck peace, no justice, no busters
And the war don't stop with the crooked cops
Highway patrol and the sheriffs and the rangers
Don't ask no questions, don't talk to strangers
If you ain't pro-black, you can get the bozack
.. and you know that!
I'm drivin Long Beach niggas insane
Cause I'm like dope, I travel from coast to coast
So what you need what you need, spin and you can win
Help (?) buy a ninety-three fin
Got them mac-10's and them big fat hens
A nigga like me out to straight check it in
I seen far too lean fall for less than a penny
Only the strong survive this long scary ride
Bad with a light saber like Darth Vader
Blastin like Space Invaders on these perpetrators
Sewed up the block from all the snaps I plot
From what they tell us niggas jealous of the grip don't even trip cause
Twenty-fo' seven, souls go to heaven but
Some don't make it take it how you wanna take it
Let the dogs loose

{*dogs barking*}

[Threat]
I gotta bust one mo' for those on death row
Cause when I get the keys that's who I'm lettin go
They say they won't attack, but you know they wanna cuff 'em
I know they ain't built two new jails for nothin
Still get smoked on Normandy and Florence
All the way from Arizona to Torrence
Don't get jacked by the ripper
Criminals - got it hoppin like individuals
Slangin down the blocks, rollin in groups
Drinkin on somethin 90 proof
So let the dogs loose {*dogs barking*}
So let the dogs loose

And it goes like this...
Skip to my Lou (Yes!)
I got a funky hop scotch game going on (Getting strong!)
I think you better follow this and come along
Heavens to Merkatroid, we've come with another new song
(Sing-a-long!) Ha (Tic!) Tica-tica-toc
(Who's that?) Coming around the block (Leaders of the New!)
Yes, with the shit that is sure to hit the spot
Oooh hot yes, come in my Dragon's Lair, that's when I turn slayer
Uno better say you're prayer
(Open your eyes!) Rise, yes I come to (Sterilize)
Mr. Parasite, I got your big suprise
Mad effective as you vision my perspective, hot shot
Look at what you got, a super ache infected speed knot
Yo, it seems stunning every time I see the fraud coming
Hundred miles and running, time to back the tools and start gunning
Let me tell you something, you ain't saying nothing with your fussing
Now you got my cussing, bake you like a muffin full of stuffing
For the world to see ya
Leaders of the New is in the place to be for '93, G
(What's next?) We come fresh no dutty boy can test
(What's next?) You know we wicked and we full up of finesse
(What's next?) Cause when we deh a dance, we have fi impress
(what's next?) For my brother B. Boogie Brown to come down

[Charlie Brown]
Brooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooown
You know I love they way it's going down (Going down!)
You know I love they way it's going down (Going down!)
I'm the one knight supreme (Being all seeing)
Soul with the role (No I'm not European)
Operator, operator, put me on hold
Stories untold, watch the dollars unfold
Watch women approach me with the inviations
Previous engagement, speculation
I hate when my girl says ""Give me some space""
On the telephone, and never to your face
I paid my dues, so lick the balls!
In the summer, in the winter, in the spring, and in the fall
I'm romping and ripping, the needle ain't skipping
Gymnasiums and stadiums the crowd be flipping
The new to the next, and of course the nextus
The greatest, the grandest, of course you expect this
In cash, boom bash, slash, grammatical
Continual residual, flow is radical
All that, and a bag of Chips Ahoy
Tell your homeboys to bring the noise
Sunrise to sunset, yes you will remember
Born on the 19th day of September
Peace to mom-du, that's C dot B dot
Not for cock block, so stop and don't jock
So take is faker snakr, phonograph no paper
Just a philly for the ride, slide, peace see you later!

What's next? (I know you love the way it's going down!) (Repeat 4x)

[Milo]
Ex the excess, your best bet check it
(Move it along) Cause I really can't tec it
Your cement mentality will end up in casualties
I got the right one, baby, and no you can't follow me
Got pieces of a dream I need to put together
I ain't checking for nobody who's tougher than leather
Whether I'm in or out of state, it doesn't make a difference
Why the constant complaining about my real appearance?
Saying ""Milo do you love me?"" You're always asking
What are you looking for action or romancing?
Now who the hell you think you're gassing? (What's crazy?)
Don't treat me like a Care Bear that's always smiling
I like drinking booze and sometimes wilding
Don't act new baby (Huh!) Or haven't ya heard?
Keep 110 mph inna me Dusinburg
Keep the main on taining at an even rate
One Newport breath taker in the morning and you know I'm straight
(What's next?) Voodoo hex, 666 years of sorrow
Broken by the strength of the 7
Just do the knowledge and don't ask no questions
(I know you love the way it's going down!)
I hit up a green light crossing and I am passing
On the road to riches, 4 by 4 riding over ditches
Next with the misses, hugs and kisses, the switch you missed
Cause mental fixes, erasional addiction
So complex, flex! (Time to have sex!) Now ask yourself what's next

You love the way it's going down! (Repeat 2x)

[Dinco D]
The sun will come out, but don't doubt the D (Tomorrow!)
Let me see Dinco you can come out and play now
If you want to, but only if you want me to
Or do strange dimentions of the pensions pile
Dispensers of bad fencers sensors while
(Busting loose) tkes over your mentioning how
It came to be in '93 with what you see now
In the corners where you go sporting cones
Only a lonely homely Jones make clones
Tone dial phone girls grown close to testes
Jingling chrome press sewn Leaders aren't lefties or jet skis
Or what you call your animal when your pet pees?
(Woof!) Fucking dog, what's next, G?

I know you love the way, I know you love the way
I know you love the way it's going down! (What's next?)

I know you love the way, I know you love the way
I know you love the way it's going dooooooooooowwwwwwwn!

I knock 'em knock 'em out the park when other rappers are hitting bunts
I'm a togger not a fogger step on runts and don't do stunts
I got SOUL POWER never took a cold shower
Now I got twenty hoes the color of cooking flour
You can call me sleazy cuz my rhymes are kinda greasy
I used to have a curl now eveybody wanna tease me
Like a Kung-Fu flick, I stick you in the dick, with my toothpick
Tell 'em Homicide (DJ Homicide: You hit them like a brick)
I like clothes and hoes but like 'em better in the sheets
I rock more beats than Jesse Owens ran track meets
Amazing feets move, they happen everyday
When the Ro to the J bring his ass out to play
I weight one-ninety but I'm, fat
I ki-uh-kick up dust when I bust like a cap
Tha lik-lik? crew, and Sugar Ray too
Is rock a show, knock a ho, and crack another brew
Make Room

[Hook: Mark Mcgrath of Sugar Ray]
It's not cause I'm seein' double
It's not cause we're causin' trouble
It's not cause you're in a bubble
Now, can you just (Kiks: Make Room!)
It's not cause I'm seein' double
It's not cause we're causin' trouble
It's not cause you're in a bubble
Now

[DJ Homicide of Sugar Ray]
It's the super, producer gets it poppin with the quickness
Homicide and the Alkies straight gettin down to business
It's all about the Liks cause they heavy on the kicks
But they easy on the treble (adjust my scratch level)
So fools can here my beats bangin' all the way in China
The skills you can't front on, Tha Homicidal rhymer
Could rip a show up to' up (???) til the crips and bloods show up
And rock these turntables til the motherfuckers blow up
But that's cause I'm slick tossin records like a discus
Y'all niggas feel these beats from fuckin' Halloween to Christmas
That's why I'm screamin on all y'all niggas like the Sonics
I'm hooked on gin and chronic like your momma's Hooked on Phonics

[E-Swift]
So when we steppin through, with the thirty-two of brew
You better make way for the Alkaholik crew
When we steppin through, with the thirty-two of brew
You better make way for Sugar Ray, fool!
Make Room!

[J-Ro]
J-Mcenroe, I'm smackin' foes
You seen that movie ""Heat""? My crew was packin' those
You lackin' flows, you come off wack in shows
You (pickin' chickens???) man we got models and actin hoes
Guess who's back down at the brew shack
Gotta cool sack of that shit to blow your dude back
Who wack? I'll beat you till ya blue, black
And make you do crack in the back of a new 'lac

What's my name? (J-Ro)
You tell them how to spell it (J-R-O)
Now you know niggy
Rest in peace (unintelligible syllable) 2Pac, Eazy
Pun, and Biggie
It's time to get drinky(?)
Break out'cha bong while I sing my song
Hope it's bomb cause I'm gonna sing it all night long

[E-Swift]
When we steppin through, with the thirty-two of brew
You better make way for the Alkaholik crew
Make room!

[Hook] w/ J-Ro, over ""make rooms and ""now""
It's the Liks baby, Sugar Ray baby
It's the Liks baby, Sugar Ray baby
Bein' drunk!

Rhymin' the Rhyme (echoed four times, beat changes)

[Tash]
Night vision, with precision, we slay with no delay
It's the Liks and Sugar Ray so feel free to fly away
Cause the ""A"" in ""Alkaholiks"" stands for ""Always been the shit"" (Word)
You can catch me in the wobble slam-dancin' in the pit
Look (the way?) my homies get when we out that alcohol
We do it all, start a brawl, tell the cops (fuck y'all)
Carl Lewis feet ain't as swift as my pen
That's why y'all niggas keep knockin' but you can't come in
Look at where the fuck we been, around the world in a day
That's why the fools can't fuck with the Liks and Sugar Ray

It's on breaker 1, 2 mike checkin'
Flexin no half steppin
When I release the funky weapon
Like Ricochet ping ping ping
I make fans fell it even when I sing
The green eyed bandit coming funky with the tune yes
I'm blowing up like Tom Berringer in Platoon
I'm playing kinda ruff like Zapp
Whapp and E-Double smack to all the crossover raps black
Who ain't down with the format
When you should be wearing khakis and not dress slacks
That's wack
You trippin you better wake up and smell the coffee
And then back up off me
I serious I can't believe some people letting frontiers in
And then compare them equal boy you must be buggin
You lucky you don't catch a slug in the chest in
From the Smith and Wessons
Change the out look
Change the cover of the book
You hip hop crook and give back what you took
It's the Funk coming at cha
So don't let the crossover catch ya
Boy stay real

II

It's on again yeah about the fake hip hop trends
For those who can't comprehend just ask your friends
They know the real deal of rap music no frontin
You can't be talking loud and saying nothing
You must be true to the game you understand
And if not I could kill you man
For being false plus extra fake on the tape
Talking hardcore when you soft like a piece of cake
You can't put nothing pass me that horrendous cause
I've been here since strictly business
The era of Eric and Rakim, Biz, Public Enemy, Run-DMC
Houdini, The Beasties, Stetsa, Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff LL
When he was rockin bells
Sucker which fake emcee is rearranging the structure band
The motherf--ker. And don't let this happen again
Cause rap could be gone the wind
So stay real

III

Yes I'm back Black for those who might be confused
And lost and don't wanna pay the cost
Of me hardcore style type a human being
On the microphone when I be emceeing
Some fake the Funk and Main Source know it
How do I know cause MTV shows it
Clowns that should be beat down on the spot
And catching nothing but speed knots the bumbadots
I insist we veto all fake emcees and wanna be's
That's worst than the AIDS disease
So wake up Spike Lee Joint
And don't be a knucklehead and get to the point
With the Funk and pump up the volume
Make the wild tune to make the party boom
Peace to Redman the Rap Funkadelic
The only emcee that's compared to Erick because I'm real

Where my building fell down on the rats and
People sold the super on a trip to the penile (penile)
While I settle off the shores of the Long Isle
My father's clean not mean my mind is clear when I transmit
I am the man-ner of the family cuz the pants fit
I want to let forensics prove, that I can mends
Groove wit the thread from needle outta hay, wanna say
Salutations to the nation of the Nubians
We bout to place you in that 3 Feet of stew again
I got the frequency to shatter Mrs. Jones' perm
I gotta +Hey Love+ all the honies cause they're short term
Tallyin the score I'm for the shottie in the jacket
For the brother he's a nigga when he packs it
So get your butt out the sling, I stung Muhammad float a note

Aiyyo groove with the mayor, hazard on the sayer
Wave the eighteen mill', eat a still
Sack or bag of troubles, make the single double
Loop the coin and join the minimum wage
I had a plan if I was the man, I'd throw the J
Lay it low and late night I get sessed
Uncondition my ways, of the everyday sunset
Wagin my days, to the one bet
Cause your breaks'll have the carrot of cakes, whether mine
Out of line, I breeze into the early mornin
Freak the WIC call and get a tap on my shoulder
Cause the days of the breaks, be just about over
The arts of the six won't play my bag of tricks
I got the sevens in my pocket somewhere
Reasons for the Cheer All Temperature here
I keep it to the rear, and then I'm EXPLODING

I be the fab I be the fabulous but see unlike the Chi
I got the flea up in the name ""ah one two, ah one two""
Can't no one bend my cousin from the Peter Piper like the others
Latchin on to when I caught the fame ""ah one two, ah one two""
Pass the task to ask me bout the Native Tongue again my friend
I tell you Jungle Brothers +On the Run+ ""ah one two, ah one two""

We in the mornin at the end, but in the end I be the is
Cause in the mix, man, it's alright
Momma got the rhythm to my daylife
My pops gots enough so best to leave or sail the waves
To the Long I laid the anchor in the 'Ville
And how I relate, the same side of my gates
Paper days, mess up my mind, ground zero degrees
And the weather feels fine
You opened my eyes man, thought I had a man
But how could I eyescan, I wasn't around
I seen the states and played the dates in the far-far
Gathered the new, from the zoas around
Grew up with Mikey Rodes and played the codes
Sometimes I don't budge, without my cous' Fuzz/fuzz
A simple, ""How ya do?"" Ah check it from my friends and my crew
Makes it definitely special

Now there's no Shiny Happy People in the crew we play the rough
I got the huff, and puff, to blow the house low
You know the neverending factor while I'm over, tell a squid
I know an Enterprising brother, so report to the bridge
I bounce a ball with my left, a squid with my right
(Cause a squid is just a punk) Yo he deserved to lose the fight
I might meander 'cross your dream, travellin up the stream
Plug Wonder Wonder Why you're lonely tonight
We see the girls scream as if we're shocked by the live shell
Let's round em up and get em back to the hotel
Motel, holiday, inn-fact!
I'm gonna let you know, once again, that De La Soul
Is sure to show you we will hit the charter harder

Rolling in my '4 with 16 switches
And got sounds for the bitches
Clocking all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches
So would you just walk on by
Cause I'm too hard to lift
And no, this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfucking D-R-E

Hop back as I pop my top, you trip
I let the hollow points commence to pop, pop, pop

Makes a gangs of snaps

And word to these hyped-ass lyrics and dope beats

Hitting the switches
Bitches relax, while I get my proper swerve on
Bumping like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic
The Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smelling like indo-nesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick cause my '4 on hit
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit
So when I crawl, I comes correct
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide

Jack moves, black fools cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a 2-11
Fuck around and get caught up in a (1-8-7)
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynching
But I just watch 'em hang
So on and so on
Why don't you let me roll on?
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak
Now everybody peeping out they window
When they hear me beating up the street
(""Is it Dre? Is it Dre?"")
That's what they say
Every single motherfucking day
Yo, but I ain't tripping, I'm just kicking it
While my D's keep spinning and these hoes keep grinning I be

[Refrain: Snoop Dogg + Dr. Dre]
Rolling in my 6-4
With everybody saying

[Hook: Jewell + Parliament-Funkadelic (Dr. Dre)]
Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(Hell yeah)
Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(With everybody saying)
Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride
(Hell yeah)
Swing down, I wanna ride
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop, and let me ride

[Intro]
""Boogie Down was performing, hey they ain't no joke""
""Down with the sound called B-D-P""

[Verse 1: KRS-ONE]
Back in the days I knew rap would never die
I used to listen to Awesome-2 on WHBI
I used to hear all kind of rap groups before sampling loops
Rappers wore bell-bottom Lee suits
Me and Kenny couldn't afford that
So we would go to the park when they was jammin' to hear rap
I used to listen till the cops broke it up
I always thought to myself ""Damn, why they fucked it up?""
But nevertheless I was in love with the microphone
And it stayed that way until I left home
On the streets of New York, now I'm free
But with freedom comes big responsibility
I used to walk around driven by the force
I remember how large Super Rhymes was when he fell off
I used to wonder about crews that used to rock
They were large, but none of them could manage to stay on top

[Bridge: KRS-ONE]
Do you ever think about when you outta here?
Record deal and video outta here?
Mercedes Benz and Range Rover outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, but we ain't goin' out!

[Verse 2: KRS-ONE]
After livin' on the streets alone
Some years went by, I signed myself into a group home
I used to watch the show ""I Dream of Jeannie""
And dreamt about ""When will I be large like Whodini?""
But I was messin' with graffiti on the subway
And gettin' chased by the cops almost everyday
I knew it had to bea better way see
So I would go to my room, blast RUN DMC
Around 1984 I left the group home, again alone
Still dreamin' about the microphone
Gimme a chance man, I know I can rock it
But I had to worry about puttin' money in my pocket
So when I reached the shelter I met my helper DJ Scott La Rock
And we both loved hip-hop
I was takin' suckas out in the shelter system
Yeah there was rappers in the shelter but I had to diss 'em
But all along, my vision was never lost
I kept seeing all these rap groups fallin' off

[Bridge: KRS-ONE]
Do you ever think about when you're outta here?
Fly girl and fresh gear outta here?
Five-thousand dollar love seat outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, but we ain't goin' out!

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
While I'm battling these rival crews
Yes, BDP would stay in the Street News
Some said, All they wanna do is battle
They can't write a song, so their careers won't last long!
Around this time I used to hang with Ced Gee
And DJ Scott La Rock used to buy gold with Eric B
I didn't meet Rakim till later with Scott
I remember we were jammin' at the rooftop
It used to irk me when these critics had opinions
Scott would say ""Just keep rappin', I'll keep spinnin'""
We had a fucked up contract, but we signed it
And dropped the hip-hop album Criminal Minded
We told the critics your opinions are bull
Same time Eric B and Rakim dropped Paid in Full
Hip-hop pioneers we didn't ask to be
But right then hip-hop changed drastically
People didn't wanna hear the old rap sound
We started samplin' beats by James Brown
In the middle of doin' ""My Philosophy""
Scott was killed and that shit got to me
But knowin' the laws of life and death
I knew his breath, was one with my breath
I had nothin' left and it was scary
So I dropped By All Means Necessary
Another hip-hop group that was a friend of me
Was a revolution crew called Public Enemy
It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back
These two albums set off consciousness in rap
But all along, I'm still lookin' around
And all I can see are these rap groups fallin' down

[Outro]
Do you ever think about when you outta here?
Condominium and beach house outta here?
Credit cards and bank accounts outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, be we ain't goin' out!

This is Dr. Dre callin' from Chronic Control
Could I speak to the president?
Awww, yeah, just tell him he was smokin' last night at the club
You know what I'm sayin?
What? - he don't inhale?
Well I know, I got the wrong motherfuckin' house
Did somebody beep me from there?

[George Clinton]
Colors don't clash, people just do
Color me happy next to you
Aww, just like it should, there goes the Neighborhood
That is what they'd have us believe

[George Clinton]
Uhhhh lookin' through a view of views
Seein' what they want you to
Blinded by the flames of friendly fire
And then they sat there like a dope
Until they choked from all that smoke
From behind a smoke screen of the patriotic liars

[Dr. Dre]
Aiyyo, well check this out
If you talked to George Clinton
Tell him I'll catch him at the next plateau with the bomb
You know what I'm sayin?
It's not the pretendo but the endo
And I'll be droppin' some straight Chronic at his front door

Yo yo Flavor man, we could kick like this
Yo, we could kick it man, yo, word up, man
Yo, check this out man
You know, the homeboys in Detroit, in Minneapolis, in L.A
In New York and down in D.C. man
They got the system in the back and boomin' it
But they don't know what we're sayin'
But the homeboys know what we're sayin'
You know what I'm sayin?
Yo, check Yo-Yo

[Yo-Yo]
If love ain't got nothin' to do with it then keep it
Ain't no big secret, we all know the reason
People change every day but life stays the same
One big game, ain't a damn thing changed
A woman's got to do what a woman's got to do
Be a mackstress, don't let these mackers mack you
So I get caught up in it, I'm stressin' and tired
The man who runs the joint gets me higher
It can be a White House, a black house
It can be a crack house, an outhouse
If it ain't the right house, go get your army gears baby
We got a fight, they ain't gonna set aside another night
(*Sample of Police Sirens*)
It's so bad that Los Angeles, is so scandalous
Give me somebody, who can handle us
Yo-Yo is on the top of things
So uhh.. color me mad, I'm ready for a change

[MC Breed]
I done came up short, one time too many
Yet a brother got to be comin' out his nickles
And countin' up his last pennies
Buyin' brushes and bum rushin' homey's greenery
Many envy but a hill of beans is what it means to me
Leave it up to me, I'm paintin' the White House black
There ain't no future in your frontin'
So why the hell you're frontin' jack?
It'll either change or we're gonna change it
""Yeah, it's gettin' old""
Usin' everything, from spray cans to charcoal
Put them up, then put the crew up on discharge
Leavin' wet paint signs in the front yard

[Flavor Flav]
Yo George, these people crazy man
They don't even know what I'm sayin'

[George Clinton]
Awwwwww airbrushed and colorized
Just changed right before our eyes, real as visualized
In every frame and let the love shine from the right house
Be in the black, red or white house
Through our fear the puppeteer can pull our strings
Whoaahh, well alright, again I say oh say can you see
The puppeteer pull the strings of you and me from the White House
The out house of territorial conquest
The HUD House, the pro-this, the anti-that
White against black, the right to life versus pro-choice

[KAM]
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Being all I could never be.. KAM READ HIS TOE TAG
Yeah, this is USA-K all day and you can't interrupt
Lay back, WATT'S UP
Stars and stripes for Tarzan types
Got brothers like me behind bars and on pipes
Damn, I'm gettin' took for a trip
They got me seein' stars from the club and stripes from the whip
Why must you all be like that?
I ain't into politics, so skip them white-collared tricks
They never did us no good
To hell with the space shuttle, put some money in the hood
And make jobs, let's mob up to the capitol
Then we ain't got to rap at all
Power To The People and the only way to get free
Is the J-to-the-U-S-T-I-C-E

Y'all can't stop the bum rush, so get the paint brush

And in a dis ya time, you have to help your neighbor
Look at the downtown area, no food to eat, no shelter

Hunger deh hunger, all over about time
All of us come together

[Intro]
Yo, whassup? This is Tajai
Of the mighty Souls of Mischief crew
I'm chillin' with my man Phesto, my man A-Plus
And my man Op', you know he's dope (yo)
But right now, y'know, we just maxin' in the studio
We hailin' from East Oakland, California
And, um, sometimes it gets a little hectic out there
But right now, yo, we gonna up you on how we just chill

[Verse 1: Opio]
Dial the seven digits, call up Bridgette
Her man's a midget; plus she got friends, yo, I can dig it
Here's a 40, swig it, you know it's frigid
I got 'em chillin' in the cooler, break out the ruler
Damn! That's the fattest stog' I ever seen
The weather's heat in Cali
Gettin' weeded makes it feel like Maui
Now we feel the good vibrations
So many females, so much inspiration

[Verse 2: A-Plus]
I get inspired by the blunts too
I'll front you, if you hang with a bunk crew
I roam the strip for bones to pick
When I find one, I'm done
Take her home and quickly do this
I need not explain this (Nah)
A-Plus is famous, so get the anus!

[Verse 3: Tajai]
Hey, Miss! Who's there? I'm through there
No time to do hair; the flick's at eight, so get straight
You look great – let's grub now
A rub down sounds flavor, later there's the theatre
We in the cut, the cinema was mediocre
Take her to the crib so I can stroke her

[Verse 4: Phesto]
Kids get broke for their skins when I'm in
Close range, I throws game at your dip
Like handball, ‘cause the man's all that
All phat, I be the chill from 93 'til

[Hook: Souls of Mischief]
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill… from 93 'til

[Verse 5: A-Plus]
Huh, my black Timbs do me well (yeah)
When I see a fool and he says he heard me tell (what?)
Another person's business, I cause dizziness
Until you stop acting like a silly bitch

[Verse 6: Phesto]
Yo, crews are jealous 'cause we get props
The cops, wanna stop our fun, but the top
Is where we're dwellin', swell and fat, no sleep
I work fit, and jerks get their hoes sweeped
Under their noses, this bro's quick
They hit blunts and flip once
I'm chillin', ‘cause my crew's close, kid

[Verse 7: Tajai]
I'm posted, most kids accept this as cool
I exit, ‘cause I'm an exception to the rule
I'm steppin' to the cool spots where crews flock
To snare a dip, or see where the shit that's flam B
Blam leakin' out his pocket
So I got tons of indo and go to the Owen's basement
My ace been fattenin' up tracks
Time to get prolific with the whiz kid

[Verse 8: Opio]
Greenbacks in stacks, don't even ask
Who got the fat sacks? We can max pumpin' fat tracks
Exchangin' facts about impacts, ‘cause in facts
My freestyle talent overpowers, brothers can't hack it
They lack wit, we got the mack shit
'93 'Til Infinity – kill all that wack shit!

[Hook: Souls of Mischief]
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill… from 93 'til

[Verse 9: Phesto]
I be coolin', school's in session, but I'm fresh in
Rappin', so I take time off to never rhyme soft
I'm off on my own shit
With my own clique, roll many backroads
With a fat stog' and blunt, foldin' runts
Holdin' stunts captive with my persona
Plus a bomber, zestin'
Niggas is testin' my patience, but I stay fresh, and…

[Verse 10: Tajai]
Restin' at the mall, attendance on 'noid
But I am shoppin' for my wish to exploit
Some ill fits, some new kicks
I often do this, ‘cause it's the pits not being dipped

[Verse 11: Opio]
Flip the flyer attire females desire
Baby, you can step to this if you admire
The extraordinary, dapper rapper
Keep tabs on your main, squeeze before I tap her

[Verse 12: A-Plus]
I'll mack her, attack her with the smoothness
I do this, peepin' what my crew gets (Huh)
Loot, props, respect, and blunts to pass
Crews talk shit, but in my face they kiss my ass (Smack!)
They bite flows, but we make up new ones
If you're really dope, why ain't you signed yet?
But I get my loot from Jive/Zomba
I'ma bomb ya; you will see, from now 'til infinity

[Hook: Souls of Mischief]
Yeah, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
Uh-huh, this is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill from 93 'til
This is how we chill… from 93 'til

[Outro: Souls of Mischief]
Hah-hah, just coolin' out, y'know what I'm sayin'?
But, but who's chillin' around the land, y'know?
Yo, who's chillin'? I think I know who's chillin'
Yeah, tell me who's chillin' then, Plus
Casual – you know he's chillin'
Yo, Pep Love – he gotta be chillin'
Jay-Biz – you know he's chillin'
Ayo, man, my man Snupe is chillin', man
Yo, Mike G – you know he's here chillin'

The ghetto, the meadow, the Mr. Butter flew
The Honeybugs dug and licked the honey dew

The lips with the soul and some jazz for ya hips
The puff, the buzz, the lids be heavy slick
The Mecca get a rush when the beats be very thick

The big, the fat, the cool cool cats
The psychedelic soul puts the Planets on the map
The chic, the love, the far out name
The lack of the funk's the main why we came
The boogie gets done, the colors won't run
The funk hits the square, the kids gotta come
The pizza with the pop, the west 4th stop

""Huh huh huh, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feeling blue, I said"" - Slick Rick (Repeat 4x)

[Verse 1]
I was walking down the street, just a minding my biz
I saw this young lady, the ultimate
She had a pair of jugs that was so fine
Then I took a look at that behind
36-24-36, I looked to her and I said ""I need a fix""
I asked her the same blahzay, blahzay
Her name, where she live, and how much she weigh
I got her digits and gave her my 1-800 beeper number
You can leave a message under the name of Rhumba
I know you're bugging off the nickname, I would be too
But every time she be walking, she turns the heads of the crew
Word is bond, I wouldn't be messing
With this girl if I knew she was an adolescent
To all the guys over 21, here's the news:
It's the hip-hop version of the Young Girl Bluez

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2]
As the story goes on, I get a little deeper
I got a strange message on my 1-800 beeper
Call my looney, crazy, psychotic or dumb
But I got a good message from a girl named Rum
She said come and get me from Mickey D's at 8
That's where I work after school, pick me up for a date
I was so excited that she called my pager
But never thought to ask if she was a teenager
She mentioned going to school, but I didn't think it was high
If you saw what I saw, then you'd know why
You wouldn't believe or even think of
A bird like that could be a dove
I picked her up in my Lexus coupe
Only God knows what I'm doing is an oof
Am I robbing a cradle? I'm very confused
I'm stuck in the middle of the Young Girl Bluez

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
Now I was seeing her for about half a year
Everything was fine and dandy without shedding a tear
Age ain't nothing but a number, that's what Chi-Ali said
Okay, then why don't you get that through the judge's head?
Proceeding along, I must have to say
It was coming very close to her birthday
I asked ""What do you want?"" She said ""A pair of earrings""
I never knew what an avalanche the future brings
Her birthday came and she gave a party
I arrived kind of late to the place to be
People was excited for seeing my face
If my mother ever knew, I would be a disgrace
""How old are you now?"" to Rhumba-reen
I was in shock when they screamed ""Sixteen!""
I felt like falling apart when I heard the news
This is the never-ending saga of the Young Girl Bluez

I never did like a mark
And you can ask my momma, all my niggas had drama
Coming from the W.S., go the length
And doing more dirt than Tide with extra strength
You can ask the people that I fucked with
Not one of them ever got their duck sick
Punk, I ain't gonna blow ya
Cause The Hunt for the Red October is over
And if I let you slap it, flip, rub it
You'll love it, my shit'll have you pussy whipped
I remember the time my nigga had a G-ride
Looking like the Westside Bonnie & Clyde
Yep it was a Cutlass
And he'll knock your ass straight out like Dick Butkis
So I'm down with the G
When all those other girls would've went out like a bad knee
I never did, punk
Even with a chicken in the trunk, smelling like skunk
About to do a drop-off
So he can go get some Daytons with the knock-offs
And if you think I'm slippin' you're trippin'
Yep, I got it going on plus I'm dippin'
Never did like the marks, cause marks just bore me
I'm coming with that Westside Story

[hook]
(Throwing up the Westside G-Ride hoo ride!)
(You can run but you can't hide from the Westside)

You say you want a gangsta bitch like Apache
Yo Yo's in the house, you can't match me
Huh, whatever
Smoking more blunts than Cypress Hill and Cheech & Chong put together
See I'm still rolling and I thought you knew
What the fuck do I do, the Sherriff, us, or you
Shit goddamn the man and Yo-Yo never was a fan of Silver Brand
I need to retire
He came up to my window and asked ""Where's the fire?""
I showed a little thigh, batted my eye
And then got away with a few lies
And when I let my hair blow
All that fool can say is ""Drive careful""
Never did like a mark, cause marks just bore me
I'm coming with a Westside Story

[hook]

Now it's '93 and I'm cruisin'
Met me a man that's down with revolution
A G of another type
Not just a nigga trying to get another stripe
And when he see the cops he put the stare on em
When every nigga that I know is just scared of 'em
He don't want to slap it, flip it, rub it
He just want to check it and protect it
And when the riots jumped off he showed power
Serving more cocktails than happy hour
He told me that the government never was a friend of me
But the real enemy
So now I do dirt of a different kind
Cause now Yo-Yo has got a different mind
Never did like a mark, cause marks just bore me
I'm coming with a Westside Story

Yo!
Get the fuck off my dick and let me rip this shit!

I write raps
And when niggas bite, I clap
'Cos their shit sounds better now
You done let me down
Cause I thought you would be dope, but instead
Your shit's dead;
You gets fed
To the alligators lurking in the moat
Peep what I wrote
You bit so hard, I though the shit was a quote.
But still I'm taxing, axing the competition
And any wack men, I stomp & dis 'em
Easily
And you can feel the pressure, plus
When I bust MCs'll be
Trampling each other trying to exit
When I flex it
The way I wreck shit is not unexpected..
Niggas just lose when I choose
The best crews of MCs
And turn 'em into refugees
I slaughter
A lotta
MCs with all the
Styles I compiles, and cut 'em off like valves
Think to yourself I write the shit
So you can bite the shit
And I'll know, despite you get props
[To da beat!]
Niggas get dropped

Sample: That's how it was and that's how it is!

Enough with this wackness
Enough is my check
Enough with these motherfuckers biting DAS EFX
I come real when I show skill
(Hey, yo, Saafir!) You macked on that ho, ill!
And that's for real, my flow still
Is everlasting, niggas forever blasting
Shots when Cas gets hot
You're not fresh, so you hating when I be just
Ripping microphones without stating the obvious
Now how much harder can it get?
Niggas try to flow, but they soundin' like me
A year ago
Shit, old, kaput, I got loot
To the hoes I'm cute, and so I always got boots
It's me, so be free to feel the ?Ivy we swing?
More niggas got my back than Rodney King.
I feel tight, knowing that the shit I write
Will be exposed to foes, and everyone will feel fright
And you'll run and tell your man, ""Yo, peep this twist
It's real, try to practise."" But the mack is
Way ahead of ya, instead of ya wack sound
I'm kickin' shit to make MCs back down
Got rhymes that kills, fills many empty heads
Niggas can be dead, I got 'em in line, like SMPTE
Red light, slow that shit down, bring it to a halt
You're wack and it's all your fault

[Intro: Shaq]
Yo Jef, why don't you give me a hoopa beat or something
Something I can go to the park to
Yeah, there you go, allright, I like that, I like that
It sound dope

(Bust 'em in the eye Shaq)

[Verse 1: Shaq]
You wanna fight? come fight me
I'll hit ya with the ""wa-psh-psh-psh"", see, see
I get dirty after dark, I'll treat you like Spielberg
You'll get your ass kicked in in a park
You don't believe me, the proof is in the pudding
Been a boy in the hood way before Cuba Gooding
I flip scrpits with the mad pa-style, freeze
Music please
I dribble rhymes like Basketball-ems
People call me E.T.,
(what's that Shaq man?)
Extra-Tallems
You better than Shaq-tack, fool, shut up liar!
I lean on the Statue of Liberty when I get tired
Than I'll punch you in the stomach, I don't give a heck
(hey yo, why you bug a hooker like that?)
Yo, she breathed down my neck!
People walk around like, Yo, they got charged!
But I'm big like Gorilla, 6'7"" ain't large!
I kick rhymes like moduck-kwong do
I smoke-smoke the mic-mic
Like Cheech and Chong do
You don't like Shaq, frankly I don't give a damn
I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Verse 2: Def Jef]

Suprise, look who's back
Not a prize from a Cracker Jack
Look at that, it's Def Jef with the Shaq Attack
Flexin', I'll be crackin your back with the boom-boom-bap
Pass that mic over here, you ain't gon' want it back
Everybody said I got fat, yep, but so did my wallet
Still ripping rhymes and dropping bombs like Khalid Muhammad
Do yourself a solid, don't flex, you go sex
You know the time, get the high-hat, the Rolex
The way I see, if I was wack like you I'd be at me
The way I hold it down, you'd swear my name was Gravity
Def Jef with the funk, Def Jef don't front, you know how the name is spelt
I'm making it vital, my title, fool, break yourself
Attack the track like Shaq on a whack broad
Coming up with the hits, and I'm coming down with the backboard
Don't fake the funk, just make the sound's up from the trunk
The reason your tape didn't hit the deck is because your hits don't bump
So get back, ain't no hassle, cause you ain't holding nuthin
Keep sticking around, you get beat down like you stole something
Sleep on me and the Shaq and jump your own hand
Cause I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Verse 3:]

[Def Jef]
Ah yeah, yall don't know nothing about this
The Shaq Man and The Arsenal
What's up like that?
Double XL in the nine-ohs kid
Skills to make mills.
Big up, Flava Unit, Funky Town pros, upstate, yeah ??? ya large
So check this out Shaq man, we gon' let this beat play right here, let all
The brothers and sister know.....

[Shaq]
Nah, nah, let me continue
I'm a be like Pete Rock and see what's next on the menu
Mic-checka, the rim and rhyme wrecka
Rocks from here to Mecca
Boom shack-a-lak-a-lak-a.
I got a hand that'll rock ya cradle
Cream you like cheese, spread you on my bagel
My Ford Explorer boomin' with the trunk of funk
All you jealous punks can't stop my dunks
The brand new like Heavy
Built like Chevy, Impala
But Shaq's a smooth balla
(Yeah, but what about rhymin'?)
I can hold my own
Knick-knack shaq-attack, give a dog a bone
Rhymin is like hoopin', I'm already a legend
Back in the days in the food stamp section
Used to kick rhymes like, ""Baby, baby, baby!""
""Every once, every twice, three times a lady.""
Is what I listend to, riding with my moms
How you like me now? I drop bombs
When you see me, please tap my hands
I know I got skills man, I know I got skills man

[Outro: Shaq]
I'd like to give a shout-out to my boy Uzi, Def Jef, Little Swany, Meech
Ron Mac, and my other cousin Ron
This is another rough shot from the arsenal
And you know what? Booty rappers, stay booty
Ha-ha-ha, and we out

Ahhh ha ha ha ha

[Daddy-O]
I'm comin with the bomb, so watch me begin to explode
And unload - like the Grand Funk Railroad
Non-stop, like a Vette with a soft top
It's ninety-three and I'm comin for my props
And what better way than to bounce?
So you can get paid by the pound; and more for the funkin ounce
It's the Brooklyn sway
And as I let the music play I wouldn't have it any other way
And if it sounds like somethin you heard before
It's all the more reason to get on the dance floor
And rock with the play by play I announce
Of the Brooklyn Bounce

Chorus: {samples}

""This is the way..""	""Brooklyn Bounce!""
[vocoder] Brooklyn Bounce
[Daddy-O] C'mon!  This is the way, ""Brooklyn Bounce!""

[Daddy-O]
I confess, to bein strung out on the funk
Steamin up my trunk like a tank full of skunk
Blowin down doors like a big bad wolf
And like a magician says POOF!
You see me dissapearin deep in the bush
Crushin all cave-men; without an Operation PUSH
But with the skills that the people call mad fat
As I stalk like a saber-tooth cat
With the sway, that makes you say
""Hey - Daddy-O's out of school today""
And yeah I'm comin out to play
With them hydrogen bombs and shit
Ignitin MC's like the World Trade got hit
And if it sounds like somethin you heard before
It's all the more reason to get on the dance floor
And rock with the play by play I announce
Of the Brooklyn Bounce

Chorus + minor variations

[Daddy-O]
And I remember fightin fair with your fists in a fight
But now I got a mac-one-one in the case with my mic
Cause it's best to be safe than sorry kid
Forget the funeral, I'll take the murder bid
And make beats from inside like Slick Rick
Might even do a duet, now that's some other shit
But I gotta keep bouncin, that's my style
So the Brooklyn crew can get buckwild
And start treadin the party and lookin for vic's
We see a lot of 'em - so who is gonna be my pick?
Tight red dress, or will I make it tight black
Have I seen you before - I say with no slack
And if it sounds like somethin she heard before
It's all the more reason to get on the dance floor
And rock with the play by play I announce
Of the Brooklyn Bounce

Chorus w/o Daddy-O (2X)

Compton, Compton, Compton
Ahh, real muthaphuckkin G's
Ahh, real muthaphuckkin G's
Ahh, real muthaphuckkin G's
Ahh, real muthaphuckkin G's

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
Hey yo, Doctor, here's another proper track
And it's phat, watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
See, you's a wannabe 'loc, and you'll get smoked, and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about sprayin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
Motherfuck Dre! Motherfuck Snoop! Motherfuck Death Row!
Yo, and here comes my left blow
'Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin' G's in
You're like a kid, you found a pup, and now you're dapper
But tell me, where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper?
Talkin' about who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
(Damn, E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day)
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his old album cover he was a she-thang
So, nigga please, nigga please
Don't step to these motherfuckin' real G's

[Hook]
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)
Boy, you should've known by now

[Verse 2: Dresta]
Every day it's a new rapper
Claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the bastard is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me, who's a witness to your fuckin' work?
So you never had no bid'ness, so save the drama, jerk!
Niggas straight kill me, knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangstas
See, I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
'Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talkin' about they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen the parts of the streets, G
Think you started tryin' to bang
Around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin' khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag tried to sag, but you're floodin' at the same time
And your set don't accept ya; scared to kick it with your homies, 'cause you know they don't respect ya
So nigga please, check nuts
Before you step to these motherfuckin' real G's

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition ""Original baby gangsta""
Approach me like you hard, motherfucker, I'ma bank ya
Shank ya, with my fuckin' shank, if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
G's, nigga please, don't try to step
'Cause if you do, then a pealed cap is all that would be left
See, young niggas like me will break you off somethin'
Claimin' my city but, Dre, you ain't from Compton
Niggas like y'all is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to real motherfuckin' G's

[Hook]
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)
Boy, you should've known by now

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
I never met a O.G. who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now, nigga, it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that y'all hoggin' shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my Doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn, it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick to smokin' on chronic at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothin' but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you're gettin' treated like boot camp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass pumped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to real motherfuckin' G's

[Hook]
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)
Boy, you should've known by now
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)
Boy, you should've known by now
Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
People give your ears so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and your concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies act like gems
Sit down, Indian style, as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy, or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the eighties, J.B.'s on ""The Promo""
In my never-ending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm taking it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second son, cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So, do that, do that, do do that that that (come on)
Do that, do that, do do that that that (OK)
Do that, do that, do do that that that
I'm bugging out but let me get back cause I'm wetting niggas
So run and tell the others cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award, and let's not make it the last

Back in '89 I simply slid in the place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was busting rhymes but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So Shaheed come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage, call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phife sloppy
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch baby, never coming less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dancefloor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Coming with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Living mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So, next time that you think you want somethin here
Make something def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

Excuse me it's the fluid makes me woozy when I sip it

This kid he tried to battle me but then he got defeated
I'm weeded, no bleep that, no keep that, no sell-out
Cause if I ever do you know my crew'll get the hell out
I'm quick with the lingo, my thing go for days

581,5297,2Pac,Keep Ya Head Up,23,1993-11-20,"

[Intro]
Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin

[Verse 1]
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothing, don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
‘Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't trying to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy? When brothers make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep your head up

[Hook]
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feeling like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize Momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent
And in the end it seems I'm heading for the pen
I try to find my friends, but they're blowing in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from getting wet up
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up
Huh, you got to keep your head up

[Hook]
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things are gonna get easier
Keep ya head up, ooh, child
Things'll get brighter

[Verse 3]
And uh, to all the ladies having babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feeling all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
‘Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more
‘Cause ain't nothing worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man, feeling helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears is rolling down your cheeks
You steady hoping things don't fall down this week
‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it
And now my son's getting older and older and colder
From having the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is driving Benz
I'm still trying to hold on to surviving friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But please, you got to keep your head up

(LL Cool J)
Yeah this one goes out to all the ladies in the house
(""For alla y'all"")

(LL Cool J)
I need two to stand by me when the chips are down and
Stick around while I defend my crown and
No sell-out, the chip is too rough and
I'll blow your skin to sofa, leave your mind to be tough
And I might seem rough but life is much rougher
To see success sometimes you gotta suffer
I need a woman that's stronger than material needs
And isn't motivated by green
Dry my tear-drops and feelin' my pain and
Watchin' my back while I strive to maintain and
Makin' love like a medicine doctor
I knew that she was bad from the day that I clocked her

(Chorus: Dawn Greene)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby

(LL Cool J)
My enemies come and my break-bread's tough but
You recognize game from your eyes and walkin'
Baby ain't no way I'll let the vultures attack you
So I'll teach you the game and tell you how to react to
The conversation, sexy vibration
Visual stimulation, slick persuasion
Times is hard, I need a woman that rolls with God
And the only man she loves is Todd
But will you be around when the raindrops fallin'
Or could it be you never loved me at all and
I need a trooper, a soldier, a agent
I need someone who can roll with my arrangement
The reproducer factor and
The Queen of the Universe, not an actor and
Standin' by her man till the end
Not only as a lover but a friend

(Chorus: Dawn Greene)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby (yeah)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby

(LL Cool J)
Man, do things get better?
We can look back at the whole aerators
Remember the times when they said I couldn't do it
But I was rougher than rough and baby you knew it and
You held back when your love jones called in
You had faith when they said they're not callin'
You understood that what we had was good
You stood by your man like a real queen should
That's why now I got you livin' your dream as
A beautiful wisdom, a part of my team and
As long as I live on this earth
Anything you want is what your loyalty's worth

(Chorus: Dawn Greene)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
(I wanna send this one out to all the ladies in the house)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby, (word)
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man (peace)
You got to stand by your baby
You got to stand by your man
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
You got to stand by your man
You got to stand by your baby
Stand by your, man, stand by your man
You got to stand by your man

...It's a new day... ya know what I'm sayin'?

A new day, brings a new problem to a brother
And all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother
Cause without my mommy dear my life would've been joke
Either locked up playin' dead and still slangin' dope but nope
The lord he had a plan for me
And with his help, my mother made a man of me
Didn't blindfold me to the world we was livin' in
Taught me how to save my little dividends
So when I graduated I'd have a little school money
But in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy
And flunked outta school with the flag pole
And left my mother dear at home with a sad soul
Because my mother worked the fingers to the bone
Cause we was alone, and me I bought an F home
My real pops he broke out with the style
So I respect my stepdad, for raisin' another nigga's child
So now we livin' comftable
Taught me the game and how to be responsible
But back then I couldn't see it
I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin'
And ended up in a big fight
And told me not to come home until I got my shit right
So now I'm livin' in my grandma's home
My grandma's strong, she's got nine kids of her own
And keepin' me ain't no big deal
But now that I'm much older I see just how the shit feels
Being kind-hearted, not wantin' to tell me no
Even though my grandfather just had a stroke
And now the money's low
And pretty soon a brother's gonna have ta go
Or either try to find a job so I can help out
I'm in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself out
And when I get out I gotta try to pave the way
So my family can have a better place to stay
I'm losin' all hope, a brother's fallin' short
I can't cope, so now I'm slangin' dope
And now my granny knows I'm doin' wrong
She just prayin' for me heavily
Take care of her grandson
And the lord must of heard her prayer
Cause he made me get a grip
And got me on up outta there
I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then
But now I feel ya...

I'm eighteen, and now I'm havin' big fun
My baby's mother just had my first son
May eleven, I never will forget the day
A star's born, let's name him little Scarface
My first born and yo I'm a proud father
I gotta son, I gots ta be my son's father
And sellin dope ain't the way that I can get ahead
But what the hell, I gots ta keep my baby fed
I buy him milk, and pampers tryin ta do my part
And he's my son, I gots ta try to make him hard
I buy him clothes, and jewellry not the Tonka toys
Because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy
And I don't want my son to look at life
Through a replica of reality tryin' to make it life-like
But yet and still I let my son be a kid
Just give him up the real, exactly like my momma did
So when he gets to be a man he'll appreciate
The game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate
And now my son is four years old
I really gots ta give the real and try to play the father's role
Because these years he'll remember most
So it's all about little Marcus and me becomin' close
But I got a buncha obstacles
If it ain't my line of work it's the girlies on my popsicle
Now everybody's got my baby
Wantin' to have their hands in my pocket tryin to drive me crazy
""It's your daughter, don't she look like you?""
I just can't tell, why don't you take it to ma momma do
Because my mother knows the real deal
All these hoochies poppin' coochie tryin' to get a free meal
So now we in and outta cope
Tryin' to get mo money, braggin' om the child support
Tellin' her friends that she's breakin' me
Now eveybody knows, that she was just fakin' G
Come to find out, the girl never had me
She's the baby's mother but me I ain't the baby's daddy
And biological tests can prove
You gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude
But now I finally got a real daughter
No need for the testin'
I know that I'm the baby's father
I heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya
You couldn't have told me nothin' back then
But now I feel ya...

I feel ya...

Now I'm twenty-two and finally got a grip on life
It's nineteen ninety-three, I put away my pocket knife
And got a bigger stick to fight with
I'm young and black so my choice ain't a nightstick
Because we livin' in a concentration set
And everyday, we face to face with death
I seen my homies go and come
And judgement day is just somethin we can't run from
So I know my number's comin' up
So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin' up
And even though I hate killin' off my own kind
I gotta be a man and as a man I'm a defend mine
My brother Quanell's tryin' to keep the neighbourhood at peace
Don't fight each other, we gots ta stand and fight the beast
So united we stand but we gonna fall quick
Because we always tryin to take another brother's shit
And the cops is in the same vote
Just because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope
They shootin' ta kill, they gas ain't sparkin' goods
They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
And now the story's all twisted up
And if they gave the cop the chair
I really wouldn't give a fuck
Because she left my partner's family with memories
And after hearin' this I know you gon' remember me
But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
I see his parents and then I started breakin' up
Because I know what you did was wrong
But you won't realize until you dead and gone
It ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning
You straight up shot him from behind
But all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back
You give a gat to a black he don't know how to act
But you gotta tell your story to the judge
Not the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves
And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
Then in reality you took care of your business
But regardless I know you wanna kill me
But I ain't goin' out like dat
Ya feel me?

...yeah

[Intro]
Uh, U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity
U.N.I.T.Y., love a black man from infinity to infinity
(Who you calling a bitch?)

[Hook:]

U.N.I.T.Y., Love a black man from (You got to let him know)
Infinity to infinity (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

[Verse 1]
Instinct leads me to another flow
Every time I hear a brother call a girl a bitch or a ho
Trying to make a sister feel low
You know all of that gots to go
Now everybody knows there's exceptions to this rule
Now don't be getting mad, when we playing, it's cool
But don't you be calling out my name
I bring wrath to those who disrespect me like a dame
That's why I'm talking, one day I was walking down the block
I had my cutoff shorts on right cause it was crazy hot
I walked past these dudes when they passed me
One of 'em felt my booty, he was nasty
I turned around red, somebody was catching the wrath
Then the little one said, ""Yeah me, bitch,"" and laughed
Since he was with his boys, he tried to break fly
Huh, I punched him dead in his eye
And said, ""Who you calling a bitch?""

[Hook]
U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity (You gotta let him know)

Infinity to infinity (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

[Verse 2]
I hit the bottom, there ain't nowhere else to go but up
Bad days at work give you an attitude and you erupt
And take it out on me but that's about enough
You put your hands on me again I'll put your ass in handcuffs
I guess I fell so deep in love I grew dependency
I was too blind to see just how it was affecting me
All I knew was you, you was all the man I had
And I was scared to let you go
Even though you treated me bad
But I don't want my kids to see me getting beat down
By daddy smacking mommy all around
You say I'm nothing without ya, but I'm nothing with ya
A man don't really love you if he hits ya
This is my notice to the door, I'm not taking it no more
I'm not your personal whore, that's not what I'm here for
And nothing good gonna come to ya til you do right by me
Brother you wait and see (Who you calling a bitch?)

[Hook]
U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity (You gotta let him know)

(You go, come on here we go)
U.N.I.T.Y., Love a black man from (You got to let him know)
Infinity to infinity (You ain't a bitch or a ho)

[Verse 3]
What's going on in your mind is what I ask ya
But like Yo-Yo, you don't hear me though
You wear a rag around your head
And you call yourself a ""gangsta bitch""
Now that you saw Apache's video
I saw you wildin', acting like a fool
I peeped you out the window jumping girls after school
But where did all of this come from?
A minute ago, you was a nerd and nobody ever heard of ya
Now you a wannabe... hard
You barely know your ABC's, please
There's plenty of people out there with triggers ready to pull it
Why you trying to jump in front of the bullet (Young lady)
Uh, and real bad girls are the silent type
Ain't none of this worth getting your face sliced
Cause that's what happened to your homegirl, right?
(Barking with no bite!)
She got to wear that for life
(Who you calling a bitch?)

[Hook]
U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity (You gotta let him know)
(You go, come on here we go)
U.N.I.T.Y., Love a black woman from (You got to let him know)
Infinity to infinity (You ain't a bitch or a ho)
U.N.I.T.Y., U.N.I.T.Y. that's a unity (You gotta let him know)

[Chorus]
Here we go here we go as the tune starts to bloom
With a phat phat phat chorus
1-2-3 if this is O.G
The freaks would ya move ya booties
The getto jam is about to slam
With some notes from the diggady D-E
As I key what's really goin on
Would ya reminisce with me-e

[Verse 1: Domino]
Saturday mornin' just gettin up
With a hangover smellin' like I fucked
I really can't remember cause I'm still kinda faded
So I close my eyes and thank God that I made it
Now I'm gettin flashbacks of some O.J
With a green glass, says Tanqueray
Took it to the head, gulped it down with the quickness
Now I need a bitch so I can handle my business
What do you know, a freak's in my reach
Threw her on the flo', stuck it in her deep
She's screamin and she's screamin and she's screamin, gettin hoarse
But then I busted a nut, and that was that
So kick the chorus

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Domino]
My homies are down, chillin' in the hood
But them hood bitches, well they ain't no good
To another man well she might be some good cat
But homies in the hood label her as a hood rat
She's scandalous
So those with game can fuck
And ooh, she'll clown your ass real fast, if you're quick to nut
And when you're in that thi-ing
She'll make a nigga si-ng
Duh-du-dway, duh-dum-dway, duh-dum-dway
But you don't hear me doe
Ain't nuthin wrong with being a Trojan man, when ya ridin
So let's kick the chorus please if ya like it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Domino]
My homie's clownin' in his dope, yellow chevy
Too O.D.'ed to be dropped
Kenwood's kickin that funk in the trunk
Clean with the rag on top, yeah
Rollin down the 'Shaw, guess what we saw, some bitches
The finest one is on my nuts, she's blowing kisses
So I approached the freak of the week
And I played it like a game of blackjack
And for all that ass that she toted around
Well I offered a backpack
And since I'm a mack
Well you know how the story goes
So all ya hoes and their bros here we go

[Hook: x2]
And we sure do like to play
I'm a player, and I'm playing just to play

[Verse 1:]
You see I made up my mind when I was 17
I ain't with no marriage and a wedding ring
I'll be a player for life, so where's my wife?
Probably at the rehab stuck on the pipe
'Cause she must be smoking and I'm not joking
Too Short baby comin' straight from Oakland
Got way mo' bitches than I ever need
I put that on a big fat bag of weed
'Cause I can give you a bitch and wouldn't give you joint
Bitches ain't shit and now I made my point
So you can light that weed while I spit this rap
And tell you 'bout a player from way back
I was only fourteen when I first got my dick sucked
Now I'm grown up and I really like to bust nuts
Gettin' freaky in the right situations
You wanna rap, well that's a nice occupation
To get pussy when you want and how you want it, fool
'Cause I was fucking ugly hoes back in high school
I used to fuck young-ass hoes
Used to be broke and didn't have no clothes
Now I fuck top notch bitches
Tell a story 'bout rags to riches
'Bout a pimp named Shorty from the Oakland set
Been mackin' for years and ain't fell off yet
So if you ever see me rollin' in my drop top Caddy
Throw a peace sign and say 'Hey, pimp daddy!'
'Cause I never would front on my folks
I slow down and let the gold diggers count my spokes
Bitches come a dime a dozen
So don't get mad when I fuck your cousin
Your two sisters, I even fuck your ex-bitch
Short Dog in the house with some player shit...

[Hook: x4]

[Verse 2:]
All the fake players peep game from the real
Player hatin' lover tell me how do ya feel
When you front to the homies how you grind 'em
Look fo' a tramp, but you can't find 'em
You got one girlfriend and see her every night
Come around her partners, lyin' about your life
Looked at your watch it said 6:22
Cut to the house and said 'Baby, I love you'
Can't act like a mack like playboy Sho'
And the rest of the macks in the streets of the O, bitch!
Comin' up we learned how to break these hoes
And when you're through gettin' yours then you shake these hoes
And when you're older, it's nothin' but a routine
Makin' G's every day, workin' blue jeans
I know I seen it before, I see it again
Young tender saying 'Short, would you be my man'

[Hook: x4]

[Interlude/Bridge: Ant Banks]
Yeeeah, there's a lot of fake players out there
Talkin' bad about Ant Banks, you know what I'm sayin'
But I ain't trippin tho
Short Dog, what you do about them player haters?

[Verse 3:]
Tryna stay away from Kris Kross imitators
Put ya in a cross 'cause they're really just haters
I thought you knew, Short Dog is a player
Born to mack, and got bitches everywhere
I ride around town in my clean-ass cars
Screenin' these hoes like movie stars
Checkin' my traps like a dirty rat
I was born to mack, I'm hookin' hoes like crack
I be a monkey on your back, bitch
Until you kick that Short Dog habit got you all on my dick
And even though I can't fuck you every day
That's cause I got another bitch around the way
We can all get together on a late night
Cut to the house hook somethin' up real tight
I really don't care
'Cause I'm a player...

[Verse 1]
You wanna front, what, jump up and get bucked
If you're feeling lucky duck then press your luck
I snatch fake gangster MCs and make 'em faggot flambé
Your nine spray, my mind spray
Malignant mist that'll leave Kant defunkt
The result's your remains stuffed in a car trunk
You couldn't come to the jungles of the East popping that yang
You won't survive get live catching wreck is our thing
I don't gang bang or shoot out bang bang
The relentless lyrics the only dope I slang
I'm a true master you can check my credentials
Cause I choose to use my infinite potential
Got a freaky, freaky, freaky freaky flow
Control the mic like Fidel Castro locked Cuba
So deep that you can't scuba dive
My jive's origin is unknown like the Jubas
I've accumulated honeys all across the map
Cause I'd rather bust a nut than bust a cap
In your back in fact my rap snaps your sacroilliac
I'm the mack so I don't need to tote a Mac
My attack is purely mental and its nature's not hate
It's meant to wake ya up out of your brainwashed state
Stagnate nonsense, for if you persist
You'll get your snotbox bust you press up on this
I flip, hoes dip, none of the real niggas skip
You don't know enough math to count the mics that I've ripped
Peep the Dirty Rotten scamp as his verbal weapons spit

[Hook]
Oh-oh! Heads up cause we're dropping some shit!
(Scratched x4)

[Verse 2]
Real, rough and rugged, shine like a gold nugget
Every time I pick up the microphone I drug it
Unplug it on chumps with the gangster babble
Leave your nines at home and bring your skills to the battle
You're rattling on and on and ain't saying nothing
That's why you got snuffed when you bumped heads with Dirty Rotten
Have you forgotten, I'll tap your jaw
I also kick like kung fu flicks by Run Run Shaw
Made frauds bleed every time I g'd
Cause I've perfected my drunken style like Sam Seed
Pseudo psychos, I play like Michael Jackson
When I'm busting ass and breaking backs
Inhale the putrified aroma
Breathe too deep and you'll wind up coma
Toast the king I'm hard like a fifth of vodka
And bring your clique cause I'm a hard rock knocker
I gotcha out on a limb about to push you off the plank
Let you draw your chronz but your burner shot blanks
When the East is in the house you should come equipped

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Fly like a jet, sting like a hornet
Knuckleheads get live and set it off if you want it
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is crushing fools no joke
With styles more fatal than second hand smoke
Don't provoke the wrath of this rhyme inventor
Cause I blow up spots like the World Trade Center
Come with the super trooper on his assault mission
The tek's technique cause he's a technician
Wishing he'll go away won't help the weapons stop
The skills are shot cause any idiot can let off a Glock
Hard rocks melt in the clutch of the sun toucher
You claim you got beef on the streets, so what ya
Gonna do when real niggas roll up on you
And you don't got your crew
Pull your Glock but you don't got the heart
You was webbed straight from the start
Bought a tool and didn't learn how to use it
Got lost in Brooklyn so you had to lose it
Just for fronting you got that ass whipped

[Hook]
I keep the mic hot, I heat it up, kid
I keep the mic hot, I heat it up

[Verse 1]
Mic check y'all
Report to the floor
The crowd wanted more so I came in the door
The great Rakim, papermates to the pen
Knowledge is born and a light strikes again
Elements burst and gave birth to the verse
Get the pen from the nurse and hook the mic up first
When it absolutely positively has to be there on time
I deliver a rhyme
Now here come hip hop, hop to this one
I got more kid, they hate to miss one
Style got jazz and the crowd's out of control
Cause I've got the mic and I've got the soul
New York's own microphone technician
Thoughts'll give 'em visions
Style'll make you listen
Devastates the ear, my opponents can't see me
I gave 'em directions, but wrote it in graffiti
But they wanna know my m.o. ease back though
They want the exact flow, then study my steelo
Sketch the skit, but they still can't see what I did
I heat the mic up kid

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Then I explode with a song with a original form
Or I'll perform it at high mode, they want the code
Destroyed the blueprints and documents and hits
Crews been, um, looking for clues ever since
Beats start brewing up, rhymes is rough
Stages and microphones self-destruct
And when you thought you had the format down pat
You get kicked back to the doormat with that
Cause I've got a high tech style with know-how
Select the file watch the crowd go wild
Bad beats to bless; females' finessed
Points I stress cause a cardiac arrest
Mics too hot for you to hold in your hands
Now they sell 'em with built-in fans and mic stands
Mine still overheats, if you touch it you can see what I did
I heat the mic up kid

[Hook]

If there's opponents that wanna rap, tell 'em ease back
I've got a knapsack with hip hop attacks
Stacks of artifacts, formats interact
Tracks at the max, and you can't relax
Rakim's equipped with penmanship
That my pen make, I've been graduatin' from Penn State
I could take any trade and make a high grade
Even get extra credit when the rhyme's displayed
As soon as I manifest, they cheat off my test
Surround my desk and then stress the progress
But they miss the point, forget the skit
I'll bust your lip if you flip the script
Brother's ain't cool and I'mma smoke up the room
And I've got a crew called the last platoon
Figure it out kid, problems coming
Emcees are running cause I'm the gunman
Extremely dangerous I bust rhymes into the crowd
And watch 'em all scream out loud
Aw man, and then I slam like a batter-ram
Ra got the plan with your favorite jam

Listen to the way they flip the metaphors and phrases
Listen, listen, it's drivin me CRA-ZY
Cause everytime I do a style and flip it kind of simple
Brothers say, ""That's fat,"" and do it on the demo
From a demo to a promo now a hit on the radio
Next thing you know, they'll be doing our video
[Mr. Funke] Same one?
[DoItAll] Same one! Concepts, whole nine
And crazy similarities to the whole rhyme
I'm not worried though (why?) I'm flippin hits from the grill
And in the underground only real stays real, so umm
Check the skills, the skills are kinda ill and yo
Here Come the Lords, cause we're here to make a kill!

(Here Come the Lords) 7X

[Mr. Funke] Aiyyo, Marley!

Aiyyo wait a minute, remember the tape you shopped around a while back?

Yo Lord Jazz, pass me some of that Brass Brass Monkey

[Mr. Funke]
Here Come the Lords, Here Come the Lords, Mr. Funke don't you see me?
I told you we were comin, you suckas didn't believe me
The Skipper, my Lords style stick like Jack the Ripper
I'm hangin other rappers like your girl hangs on my zipper
Lord Jazz, hit me one time, make it funky
Stop being stingy knocka, pass that Brass Monkey
I step, off a stage, everyone knows, who I am
Grab the mic like Teddy Riley and I _Jam_ (chicka, aawww, Jam)
Give me the mic and watch me wax that ass *horn sample*
Keep the camera moving cause I'm kinda fast *horn sample*
You can trip, you can flip, you could even slip or dip
But you'll never ever rip, Funke style as good as this
Because you sound like you're drugged, you might as well be a singer
Your whimsy couldn't touch me if your name was Sticky Fingaz
So when I come around, don't try to be down, don't try to be down
Just dig the sound, cause here comes the Lords of the Underground

(Here Come the Lords) 7X

[DoItAll]
Well umm, open up the doors and yell, Here Come the Lords
Yell it loud yell it loud, let me hear it from a crowd
I packs em, _In the Closet_ like Michael Jackson
And love to hear the girls go OOH when I'm rockin
So catch it, no stutter in my flow but I wrecks it
And caught you on the dillz from my jam called _Check It_
Check it check it check it check it microphone check it
Yeah, you went wild, cause your moms digs my records
So come on, I'm takin you where the sun don't shine
The underground, but everything is fine
I rhyme, copacetic, unless it gets hectic
Your vocal chords'll get CRACKED, you gets no chloraseptic
So hit em, so chill, chill man chill
I know who used to be but now who's _Top Bill_
Well it's me, and yes, I am back by the Funke
Marley filled the House with Hits so you know The Lords are chunky
We stink, like pee-eww, funk from my shoe
But what about this funk, can two brothers like us do
But get down like James Brown and rock the whole town
Hah! And now The Lords have broke ground

Ohh.. steppin up in my motherfuckin uhh..

On my back I got the uhh.. sweatshirt
You know, with the fat three creases
Uhh, my t-shirt, Slingshot, uhh.. khaki shirt
Umm, and I got the Cake cutter in my—in my pocket
Uhh, got the afro, the braids
Motherfuckin uhh, rollers
""You got to believe in somethin""
And I just ask my motherfuckin self, uhh
""Why not believe in me?""

[Verse 1]
To G or not to G, is the question
And like Smith told Wesson
I'm shady with the .380 old school diploma
I'll leave that ass in a coma, so
If you got a herringbone, Welcome to the Terrordome
Two-eleven, sorry Reverend
Oh my god, gettin robbed
Reach for the smog, ""Atomic Dog""
Hard to swallow, janky as Rollo
Count to ten, and don't try to follow
Cause just like Waco, I can take fo'

Bust a left on Western, go and get a room
Don't want to be a felon like Stacey Koon
Get the right bitch, hit the light switch, here we go
Tap that ass like this - really doe

[Verse 2]
Thirty in a holdin tank, catch the vapors
Make me a pillow out of toilet paper
Concrete bench kickin' off the hemorrhoids;
Eses deep, don't fuck with dem boys
Phone check, collect call from the baller
Her mama said please don't call her
Do-Wah-Diddy, far from New Jack City
Seen one of my peers, ""What the fuck you doin in here?""
He said, ""One-eighty-seven on the enemy
And they treat me like I just shot a Kennedy!""
Deputy bitch thinks she's the Queen Bee
Ink on my thumb, index, and pinky.
""Sir, what set you from?"" Play dumb
""General popu-la-tion""
Mama put your house up, and I can bounce up
Out this motherfucker, that's why I love ya
Out like a boss, with a half-pint of sauce
Got the shit sewed up like Betsy Ross
What a friend know? Buy some indo
Never fuck with a silly ho - really doe

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Knock you out like NyQuil, I'll kill you quick
You sucker-for-love-ass trick
So don't run up, wit ya gun up
Cause I got the back breaker, double pump rump shaker
Cause we can play hookie in the Aqua Boogie
With concrete Nikes, ya gets no stripes
Livin unforgiven with the mic on
And punks runnin like roaches with the light on
And that's all the shit I'm startin
Bust a cap (ka-kow-POW) like Jerome on Martin
You lookin for a punk with benefits
Cause you got a baby, that take many shits
And you know I got a grip like a baby on a tit
Scopin', hopin', thighs open
But I kick back, six-pack, and hit the Phillie slow
Hooker ho - really doe

Stand clear, Don man'll talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out, we run New York
Policeman come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack, but you be doin' that
I'd rather say see ya, ‘cause I would never be ya
Be an officer? You wicked overseer!
You hotshot, wanna get props and be a savior
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
‘Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
‘Cause we be getting hyped to the sound of da police

[Verse 2]
Now here's a likkle truth, open up your eye
While you're checkin' out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word overseer, like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew, for example
Overseer, overseer, overseer, overseer
Officer, officer, officer, officer
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity? Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off, patrollin' all the nation
The overseer could stop you, ""What you're doing?""
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've got no choices
The police them have a likkle gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way

[Refrain]
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da police
Woop-woop! That's the sound of da beast

[Verse 3]
Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminal are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one P.D
But just a mere Black man, them wann check me
Them check out me car, for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed, ‘cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up 'til today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary, him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My great-grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great—when it's gonna stop?!

But nevertheless ya gots to get down
Fantasy freak thru the beat so unique
Ya move your feet, the sweat from the heat

Back to the fact I'm the mack and I know that
The way I kick the rhymes, some would call me a poet
Poems steady flowin, growin, showin sights an' sound
Caught in the groove in Fantasia I'm found

To an infinite height to the realm of the hardcore

Rhyming on the mic and bringing suckas to disasta
Beaucoup ducks but I still rock Nike
With the razzle dazzle, star I might be
Scribble drabble scrabble on the microphone I babble
As I flip the funky words, into a puzzle
Yes yes yes, on and on as I flex
Get with the flow birds manifest

Know that I come with the static, erratic, .45 automatic
Screamin' at ya-the red lights beamin' at ya
No need to run after the punk-ass who'd run up to my crew
Dig the grave for the one who got played
Now he's under
Don't make me wonder why cause you'll testify

And ride around to the liquor store
Can't get a job get drunk some more
You betta stop trippin on dem stereotypes
Cause in the ghetto there's a good life
We ain't starvin like Marvin, won't see no roach
When ya chill wit the rich folks in the hood
You're sittin on leather watchin big screens
Bought by the dope fiends
Smokin, and what about the brother wit the good jobs
Savin money, and workin hard
Bought a house for his wife and kids
Ya only got one life to live
Another brother got some cocaine
You know his face, but don't know his name
You know he got the sack mayn
And he's sittin on a fat bank
Seven cars at his house in the driveway
Benz so clean don't roll it just fly away
Cause folks got money in the ghetto.. yeah you know

[Hook One]
Hey hey hey.. whatcha got to say (There's money in the ghetto)
Hollywoooooood! Havin money in the ghettooo

[Verse Two]
Money in the ghetto ain't nothin new
It's been like that, way before you
Was even born, get up from the down stroke
Chocolate City for the black folks
Say it loud in ya hot pants
Man child in the promised land
I take you back to Iceberg Slim
And all the players that came before him
If you a everyday hustler, get your money
Cause what they do to black man ain't funny
All the time tryin to put us the pen
You get paroled and then they send you again
All the homies in the hood gettin paid
You might have left but the money stayed
In the ghetto, it ain't all about drugs
Gettin paid doin all kinds of stuff
Only rule on the streets is don't get caught
Unless your hustle ain't breakin the law
And even though rich folks got it good
We sittin on 'em fat in the hood
I'm ridin on some gold ones
Smokin dank and it's potent
Ask them fools, cause they know
There's money in the ghetto

Chorus One

[Verse Three]
I got money baby, just tell me the price
Cause Short Dawg ain't nuttin nice
I always hit the town wit my boy Ben Franklin
Spend fo', get an ounce of dank then
Rich nigga get high relaxin
If I bust a Ben Frank' get some Andrew Jacksons
Five twenties for a hundred dollar bill
You know the math, let's make a deal
On the one dollar bill if you look on the front
You find the face of George Washington
Make money baby, that's all I do
That's how I know Thomas Jefferson is on the two
Abraham Lincoln got shot and died
Freed the slaves so they put him on the five
And Hamilton, my old time friend
They put his face on the front of the ten
These are the dead presidents
From the hood and they represent
The American dream for the average minority
Make your money, get some weed and a forty
I'm on the Eastside livin' like a king
Kick back watchin fifty-inch screens
Bounce to the Westside, hit the studio
And spend my money in the ghetto

[Hook Two]
Hey hey hey.. whatcha got to say (They got money in the ghetto)
Hollywoooooood! Havin money in the ghettooo

[Verse Four]
Nowadays if you can't say a rap, or play sports
You might just come up short
And they always say the same things
Don't be a gangster or a dopefiend
Get your high school diploma, go to college
Get a degree and start makin' dollars
Only one thing wrong, and it's a Trip
Inner city schools don't teach us shit
Got us stuck on stupid, Straight S.O.S
Can't get nothin, but they payin the rest
Of them fools
All Around the world in the other countries
They should be spendin that money right here
In the state of California
You graduate and can't spell ""diploma""
Dip to the hood and get rich
Slangin rocks to a smoked-out bitch
No school'll come close to that
A few transaction make my pockets fat
I make a lot of money and it ain't no lie
I'll probably ball 'til the day I die
And if I didn't, so what?
I bet you I'd still come up
Cause there's a whole lot of money in the ghetto.. yeah you know

Low riders, '77 Sevilles, El Do's
Nothing but them 'llacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking bout a black man heaven here, nahmsayin, yeah

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
It's beginning to look a lot like, what? Follow my every step
Take notes on how I crept, I's bout to go in depth
This is the way I creep my season, here's my ghetto rep
I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find something to do better bet
I said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right
I'm like no matter what the season
Forever chill with Smith
I sip my fifth, I chill with Wesson, got my reasons
So tell me what did you expect
You thought I'd break my neck, to help y'all deck the halls
Oh naw, I got other means of celebrating
I'm getting blizzard at HoJo, I got that hoochie waiting
I made it through another year can't ask for nothing much more
It's OutKast for the books I thought you knew so now you know
Let's go

Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day
When the player's ball is happening, all day ery'day

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Halle-lu-jah, halle-lu-jah
Y'know I do some things more different than I used to
'Cause I'm a player, doing what the players do
The package store was closed, okay my day is ruined
This is ridiculous, I'm getting serious, I'm getting curious
'Cause the house is smelling stank, the chitlins old as bitches
I made no wishes cause I'm mobbing folk niggas in the back
Getting tipsy off the nog and high as hell off the contact smoke
They having a smoke out in my back seat
They passing herb rewinding verses 'cause it's in the air
I hit the parks, I hit the cuts, I'm hitting switches
'Cause I'm switching from side to side looking for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe
'Cause a junkie is a junkie three-sixty-five
It's just another day of work to me the spirit just ain't in me
Grab my pistol and my ounce see what them junkies gotta give me
'Cause it's like that, yeah
Forever pimpin', never slippin', that's how it is

All the players came from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell you there's a better day

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Ain't no chimneys in the ghetto so I won't be hanging my socks on no chimney
I'm fit as a tick, fix me a plate, I got the remedy
Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smoking rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know in '93, that's how we coming
So ho ho hoes, check my king-ass 'fro
The gin and juice has got me tipsy so, um...

[Verse 4: André 3000]
It goes, give me ten, and I'll serve you then, now we bend
The corner in my Cadillac
My heart does not go pitty-pat for no rat
I'm leaning back, my elbow's out the window
Coke, rum and indo fills my body, where's the party?
We roll deep, we dip to Underground, see a lot of hoes around
I spit my game while waiting countdown
A five, fo', a three, two, here comes the one
A new year has begun, P-Funk, spark another one..

Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide
Down, for theirs

May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breeze through?
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'

Comin' from the West Side
Nothin' but the West Side

Ain't nothin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin' all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin' six on the tee-ta-lee, you don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes, like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille
My truth can, ill - fool I got skills
So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

Chillin' with the homies, smellin' the bud
Double parked and I'm talkin' to Dub
About who got a plan; who got a plot;
Who got got; and who got shot
Cause everybody knows that he got the info
Crazy Toones hangin' out the window
Fool I got them bomb-ass tapes
Da Lench Mob, Planet of the Apes.
I'm down with Eiht, and Watts Up
Kam and Solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want ""The Bomb,"" just like George Clinton

Put on Knee Deep, we'll turn out your party
You gets no love and I thought you knew it
Fool, you know how we do it

You know how we do it

Jack be nimble, and Jack be quick
If you wanna jack me on a lick, cause
I'm that fool from South Central
You'll think you stuck yourself, with a number 2 pencil
That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With ""Mo' Bounce to the Ounce"" in the dash
Mash up, Van Ness, headed for the West
Everything is great, slow down for the dip
On a 100 and 8th and keep mashin'
Don't drink and drive to keep the fo' from crashin'
Stashin' a Glock and I thought you knew it
You know how we do it

Comin' from the West Side, West Side

613,5617,Shaquille O'Neal,I'm Outstanding,18,1994-02-19,"

I was born three-six-seventy-two on a Wednesday
Hail to the moon, just like Kunta Kinte
That means I'm gifted from the get-go
Mom's you never let go
Mad thanks for raising me right, bro'
You gave me confidence to stop the nonsense
Didn't live in Bel Air like the Fresh Prince
Times are hard, times are rough
Didn't have Toys R Us toys, but I had enough love
Plus the guidance from above
To go to the park, sweatin' push and shove
Maybe then for a dunk like you told me
Then there were a few times when Dad had to scold me
Prayed for my safety, I know how you was feeling
Didn't want me wheeling and get to drug-dealing
Remember when you asked me this one day
Who I wanna' be like, I said Dr. J
Then you said, ""Good, now you gotta' go
""Take the damn ball and slam it through the hole.""
Mom cracked a smile, Daddy gave a frown
I said to myself, ""I can't let them down.""
So make way, I'm coming in for a landing
And nothing's gonna' stop me, from being outstanding

I'm outstanding

Now let's skip to the time when I was fifteen
Shaq is in the house... no, Shaq is on the scene!
Now my name's in papers, girls caught the vapors
Kids look up to me like a skyscraper
Now, a role model... I mean a role figure
Then I ask myself, can I get any bigger?
My dream is coming true, but coming true slowly
Then I remember what Mom and Dad told me
""Remember this, son, you are the one
Shoot your gift like a gun and never forget where you come from
You're young, gifted, and Black
If they can't say Shaquille O'Neal then make 'em scream, 'Shaq!'""
Like the fam' do, in the stands who
When I freak the funk on a dunk they, ""Ahhh! Oooh!""
From high school to college, they gave me enough knowledge
Make that gift and now it's
Time for me to fulfill my dream
To be in the [leaders' game?] like Hakeem
I'll make the backboards shatter
Fans chit-chatter
Even make the other cen-ters get madder
That's me. Who can it be?
The master of disaster, seven foot three
Brother, ain't no other in the nation
I'm born from my mother but I'm God's creation
I'm outstanding

I'm outstanding

Cause now I'm outstanding
Wave your hands and pump your fist
When I'm on the court you know it's strictly ""Swish!""
Cause there's some things that I gotta' do:
Tape up the ankle, pump up my Shaq-shoe
And now it's time to take care of business
To run up the court with Nick and Dennis
Scott, but I won't stop
Gotta' keep striving until I reach the top
Gonna' take a peek over the mountain
I flow like a fountain
Peace, I gotta' go! And I'm out and...
But before I go, wave your hands
Peace to all my family, friends, and fam
I'm outstanding

""Money's growing like grass with the mass appeal""

[Verse 1]
No way, you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I'll break it
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one-time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under
Their noses, I hate those motherfucking posers
But I'm so real, to them it's scary
And with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me
And no, we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back
When I'm kicking real facts
I represent, set up shit like a tent, boy
You're paranoid cause you're a son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Oh yes, I'm greater than all MC's when I breeze
Give me room, please
I be like fascinating when I be updating
Cutting off wack kids, pulling their trump cards
I thump hard, and make 'em say that I'm God
Niggas be pretending they're hardcore
Never know the meaning of (raw)
But I get props like a slogan
And no man could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connectin', complete mic-wreckin'
No double-checkin', vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to, I go all out with no mic
Yeah, that's right, cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel
Cause suckers be like playing themselves to have mass appeal

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I know I'm dope, but don't wet that
I've suffered setbacks, but now I'm making greenbacks
Just like baggy slacks, I'm crazy hip-hop
Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop of pure bomb
Just like the seashore I'm calm
But wild, with my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Give me a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond, I go on and on
For you it's tragic, I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I bet ya
Those who kick dirt, in due time I'm gonna get ya
Cause I be kicking the real
While they be losing the race trying to chase mass appeal

Nowadays you gots’ ta walk the street and watch your back
Cause brothers with the gats don't be knowin’ how to act
They always pull the Glock when somebody rocks a knot
And if they get shot they often snitch to the cops
Now tell me this ain’t livin foul
She just had a baby child and she’s back to sellin’ cracks vials
On the Ave cause she’s addicted to the fast cash
How long will that last before the cops be up in that ass
But honey-dip dont wanna listen cause she’s in no position
Now nobody gives a pot to piss in
Her life is stuck and filled with bad luck
So she fucks and fucks to earn another buck
She don't really care about pride
And she jumps into another ride then comittin’ suicide

Verse Two (Shyheim):
Times is gettin' hard, word is bond I swear God
I even got caught tryin' to steal from the junkyard
A born terror, A rebel without a pause
Ain't nevah had a good Christmas so who is Santa Claus
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil’ town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a Glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parkin' lot
In front of my buildin' I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigga and tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day

Hook

Hey Yo, get a load of this guy you know the Mr. Hard-y
He the one who talk about gats but ain't' bustin nobody
He speaks the name game so he can just maintain
I'd blow him out the frame but his mom said he gang bang
But his rep was hi-tech in the projects
Pulled his knuckle-jacks so he got mad respect
The niggas in hoodies packed up their loaded gats
Met up in the back so they could plan the attack
Wasn't hard to tell that these kids was no joke
They let the pistol smoke and at nine was dopin’ and coked
I seen it happen everyday where I live
I know a few brothers, drug dealers, most of them fugitives

It's from ol' school to new school coming back with a twist
It's the Lighter Shade bringing back the funky rhythm
Time to show 'em what I give 'em
Show 'em how I use to live 'em
Back in the days before Hip Hop departed
No more dicso fever John Travolta finished what he started
Walking down the street with your ghetto blaster bumping
And thumping break beat always urge to rap something
Nowadays you got a new type of flavor
A certain rap behavior Lighter Shade returns the favor
I'm giving props to all D.J.'s
That play the ol' funk you know how we play
And as the MC let the freestyle funk flow
Every once in a while they make the crowd scream, ""Ho""
Jumping around wasn't the thing they did
Steady bopping their head while the girls had said

Can I get a dang dang
A ringa dang digga digga digga dang dang

As I swing to the old school, funk
94 bump pop it in your trunk
And lay back and relax for a while
As I kick It to this smooth, dope style
And commence to a get you in the mood
Move to tha groove cause ya now your gonna do it
And checka, checka, checka, check it out (Check it out)
Step right up and see what the Shade is all about
Who the flavor, I'm the flavor
And I came here just to save you
With a bit of the same old that you heard
Huh, now can I get a word
As I'm goin', goin',  gone
Hey D.J., come on and play me that funky song

[Verse 3: One Dope Mexican]
Now I remember around the way back
Back in the day I use to know
A DJ who could mix it wicked it
Pick it up, pick it up, like check one two
Only now there's just more than a few rappers
MC's, who boast and they brag
A bag full of hits cause the Shade will never lag
As I rip it, I wreck it, so check it
Yo, D, bust a fat rhyme for the fat record
Hippity hop what it's the loco
Peep the game to the PG and the vocals
As I reminisce over this and that yo oh
Where we gonna take 'em (Way back)
Like I said before and I'll say it again
It's the old school versatile flex when we band
Eel skill that we got, you know we got mad props
So play me that funky song

It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian; half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up

School a fool well, you feel it, like braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell

[Verse 3]
This rhythmatic explosion
Is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep; well, let me try again
Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MC's eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell; it ain't hard to tell

I hear the (gunshot), but I'm here to stay

[Verse 1]
Well it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood
A beautiful day in the neighbor-hood
Can't go wrong, I feel strong and the flavor's good
I'm with whatever comes my way, hip-hop hooray
Latifah's on vacation, I'm just plain old Dana today
I strap out, step out in every direction
Glock, TECs, jimmy hats, in case I need protection
So I Land Cruise, pump sounds, play out wanna be’s
A kid in a M3's getting jacked right in front of me
So I play the Tech close, my finger's on the trigger
Don't wanna get wet, so they step
Cause mine's is slightly bigger
But better yet, I'm a threat, so you better walk
Or get sketched out in chalk, cause I don't wanna talk
I stay true blue, I'm hoping it's you too
I got the fever for the flavor of a Woo Woo
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Time to chill, hit the hill uptown, let's peep the sights
Shoot some pool, act a fool, cause it's on tonight
I'm doing the knowledge, it's not easy, easy
Watchin a cop cuff a kid for sellin a clip to a DT
But it's home, so I flex, get pressures off my chest
Slip in a tape, now which hood should I hit next?
Stomach ache, head to Steak-N-Take for a bean pie
Get a Final Call from the brother in the bow tie
I'm where little kids, dream, and fiend for fun
Lots of laughter, moms, no pops playing with her son
I passed by a girl's wake, they say she died at seven
Hit by a stray, but I pray that there's a hood in heaven
Fake brothers claim there's no shame in their game
You know my name, show me a real nigga with a brain
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day around the way, hey

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
You know I gotta give props, I can't stop
Without y'all, I'll be nothin
No wreckin', no checks, and no rhymin', no cuttin'
No stages, front pages, no phones, no beepers
No reason to put Queen in front of the name Latifah
I come with the real life perspective and rule
Cause me and my peoples around the way remain cool
So it's back to the block, time to play
It's just another day, around the way
Around the muthafuckin' way

Creepin' up on those Romper Room suckas who wanna get some
So feel the wrath of a brat with the Mac pack
Walkin' away you're like the bottom of a door mat
I didn't gain props cause I was a suckas daughter
I had to earn them droppin' dynamite like Jimmy Walker
I can pay Donny Mars in a sticky cage
Give me 30-30 half-callibar half-gage
And if you don't know what I'm talkin' about
Test me out
We're in the big part of in The Last Boyscout
Scopin' a needle is like a needle in a haystack
Press the new rookie breakin' rims down like Shaq
You think you're dealin' with a weak boy step back
Cause I'm comin' up like a Veteran on a phat track
I'm bein' all I wanna be so you tell Uncle Tom
Dat Da Brat done drop da bomb

I know you hear me comin here I come
So you besta watch ya back
It's da bomb

And I am what they call Da Brat

[Verse 1: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]

[Q-Tip]
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was working at the club you would not pay
Aiyyo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say

[Phife Dawg]
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talking 'bout you

[Q-Tip]
Yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state
But I couldn't drop dimes cause you couldn't relate

Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down
Relax yourself girl, please set-tle down

[Verse 2: Q-Tip & Phife Dawg]

[Q-Tip]
Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl
Drive you insane, drive you up the wall
Staring at your dome-piece, very strong
Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon
Take you on the ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy

[Phife Dawg]
Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
But hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik
The Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
She simply said, ""No"", labelled me a ho
I said, ""How you figure?"" ""My friends told me so""
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that

[Q-Tip]
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep in my jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets

[Phife Dawg]
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture

[Q-Tip]
Shaheed, Phife and the Extra P
Stacy Beadle, PJ and my man L.G
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
The character is of men, never ever of mice
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice
It has to do with lots of loving and it ain't nothing nice

Chorus (4x):
Pumps and a bump, Pumps and a bump, we like the girls with the Pumps and a bump!

Verse 1:
Just when I thought could I hit another one
So up jumps see me with the pumps and a bump
All stiggitty stiggity curves, getting on my good nerves
Looking like ice cream ready to be served
Stretch, bend it, can I get in it
If you wanna kick it with a G baby here's me
Cause I come equipped, I'm a pimp, slippity slip, out your clothes and take a trip

Chorus(4x)

Pumps and a bump, now many say a big butt
But if you're hip you know that it's a phone crud
It's making the brothers go crazy in the 2-G
Shake like a bottle girl fine as wine G
So when I here I got a step (to a fine thing)
Never been a coward (cause it's a eastside thing)
Just step right up to the girl with the big butt
Tell her what's up you got the pumps and a bump

Bridge:
Men: Aaalll
That we waant
For the rest of our life, is a girl thick and tight
Ladies! Aaall
That we waant
Is man who is right, who can hit it all night!

We gotta bump the pumps!

Chorus(4x)

I don't like 'em figgity fat! (No!)
I like 'em stiggity stacked (Yeah!)
You wiggity wiggity wack if you ain't got biggity back (Awwww!)
Now when you see the rump shaking on the dance floor
You following with your eyes and get hypnotized
But a fella like me will dance up to some chopping and chewing
Keep em bottling you know I keep 'em bobbing
I put my fingerprints all over that rump
I'm guilty as hell but I love the pumps and the bump! (Ow!)

[Chorus - sung]
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

[Heavy D]
I got a funny feeling, honey
That you're kind of digging me
But every time you see me
Word is born, you be ignoring me

I know your name, yes, I do
Because your girls told me
I know where you live, you want to bet
Because your girls showed me

But I'll parlay
And stay out of your way
Figuring I won't be ignorant
And catch you the next day

When I'm in focus, I notice you
Only move with a chosen few
Irreplaceable, what's up
With insatiable you

I never figured you
For the quiet type
On the down low
The low pro-file type

I always thought you
Was a rah rah mama
Stirring up crazy confusion
Causing drama

What's the matter, huh
Cat got your tongue
Or some mack got you strung
Or maybe I ain't the one

I want to know cause if I don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up
You got me thinking you want me

[Chorus -sung]
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

[Heavy D]
I'm steady, picking my brain
Trying to figure your game
What's your angle, tell me
Where you're coming from

The whole picture is strange
So I'm digging the frame
Because I like what I see
And I want some

So tell me what's your plot
What's your plan
You're looking for
A brother to get got
I'm not your man

But believe in me
You want to be with me
But you won't even talk to me
To tell me what it is you see in me

I got to hear it from your girls, Uptown
The word got around from my crew
In Brooklyn and in the Boogie Down
Said you had a thing for me
And what would it take for a date
And wait, swing with me

I got your cards
You're playing hard to get
I'm long and I'm strong
And if it's on
I keep it soft and wet

Let me know cause if you don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me

[Chorus -sung]
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

[Heavy D]
""Hey, yo, hey, yo....""
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party
""Hey, yo, hey, yo....""
Look at all the cuties
Swinging in the party

I never stumble cause I'm humble
And I'm ready to rap
You got me feeling like I'm sleeping
And it's keeping me trapped

But still in all, you want to stroll
And have a fella on layaway
Fronting for nothing like it's
Something for me to stay away
Emotional trips
Get a grip
Because I'm losing it
Ideas was clear
Had it in gear
Now you're confusing it

I had the thought
That you were caught
And you were going steady
Wasn't checking for me
Cause you had a friend already

But I'm a put it all aside
Cause God is my guide
Swallow my pride, stride
And follow my guide

Let me know cause if you don't
It's going to haunt me
Yo, word up, you got me
Thinking you want me

[Chorus -sung 4X to fade]
Got me waiting, anticipating
You got me thinking
I want your love
I'm trying to show you
I really, really want to know you
You got me thinking
I want your love

[Chorus x2]
Now everybody wanna play my funk
Now everybody wanna play my funk
Now everybody wanna play my funk
Now everybody knows me

I was walkin on the railroad
I sat my booty on the track
I saw this kid with the Gap sack
So I snatched my booty back
I said looka here, partner
You know you can't be me
I be the one, it ain't two now
And you know it's true

Now move on
I got the fellas jealous cause I flows like none
I got the whole nine, need not pack a gun
No need for greed, see I takes then I feeds
To the young, sprung on the air that I breathe
You can't concieve how I braids and I weaves
Hear you over there, may appear
Some fear for the smear
We're gonna have in abundance
I write, see I write, see I write
Did you know that

[Chorus]
Now I'ma fuck around and make a b-boy mad in a minute
Shit, I'm so nice niggas think I'm freakin senate
Status - I rank top-notch, come on now
I've seen less mess in my restroom
Plop on up and fetch a fierce self-check
I digs how my voice takes muthafuckas over
Trick, back it up 'fore I buck, buck another
Pass me the present cause the future can't hold my soul
I pump fear in the mere mortal, beast control
I blast, punk, that ass fast
Feel the funk, savor 'fore you face defeat
My backbone of stone totes treats to beats
Now come on
Adapt to my taps, I'm two snaps
I'm too through, ooh, I'm too through
I kicks butt, strut as I gluts for fame
And goes 'can't nobody hold me'

[Chorus]
I'm the abyss, ready to determine your lifeline
You falls too short, so I be tall in your acetone
Death died so I'm here to stake my claim
Bang-bang, boogie-boogie, my style's a gang
Give it up, I funk it up, chick, I spits hits
Look back, you ain't stacked, get to face this
Who's bad? My notespad are flamin folks
Fire, on fire, koombaya, beaucoup funk
Now pump that in your tire, like that
Terry, bring it back, bring it back like that
My Wranglers in need of a washin
Got no time to shoot the shit in no fashion
Pardon my French, I'll kick your ass - me no favor
Be that behind, I be the vain soothe sayer
Step up, bow to my spunk
Mama moves, I grooves, your lefts be my rights and...

Say you want wine? Yeah, I guess that's fine
But thai is the sky when you talkin' about mines

Got me all straight now my dick won't bend
Now I'm fucked for the rest of the night
Unless I find a piece of ass whether it's loose or tight
Now looka here looka here I done found a bitch
Yummy for the dick, Jelly mix in the switch
Save that shit cuz I don't wanna be your man
Just need a little loosin', do you understand?

My mind's fucked up off chocolate thai
Hit the gin shop now I'm so high
Now I need a bitch that's proper and fly
So break me off a piece of that sweet potato pie

Thinkin' about what I'm gonna do today
Party at my homies bout eight
I thought about goin' to the movies
But ain't nothin' like a bunch of proper ass hoochies
Dressed like a player can't wear nothin' less
Some simple ass shit, even if it ain't Guess
Take  a couple of shots and now I roll to the spot
Bitches straight peepin' wanna know what I got, well
One, two, three, Here comes the D
Pass me the buddah, OOOOH WEEE!!!!

And now I'm proper and fly and shit, but man do I feel strange
So Imma go down to the liquor store, and find my friend named Gin
And go to the girl with the flyest thai, and break her off a proper twin
And now it's time to make some shit, and look for the proper mix
And run a little game on the PYT, and tell it to her somethin' like this

I'm leavin prints on your neckline, signed 'Mr. Bogart'
Another victim of society
Why did you lie to me?
So I gotta use my strap daily
And take you muthafuckas out
It coulda been prevented, but the niggas was sho' from the sto'
A.K.-47 ways to heaven
I took em for a 211
And left his ass with 187
Just a another nigga dead and gone
He fell victim to the chrome as I punched in the gold broam

I'm known for kickin hoes and niggas' necks and causin istant death
Young niggas goin in and comin out winnin
The gang story that a nigga's tellin

I gives a fuck when I creep
I told you I was evil as a nigga when I'm lyin by the devil 'sleep
I let the slugs fly quick
The Tec-22 is in your ass like flies on shit
I'm from the dephts down below, the groundward
The graveyard, rockin you niggas, cause I'm that hard
Rhimeson casuin havoc for the underground
You fuck around, you lay around, and yo, you hang around

The Glock-9 plays connect the dots off in your ass, bitch
The hardest nigga with a g slang

Just another muthafucka who got tore down
Came home and beat his ho down

Low down, but now his little brother's stuck on payback
Rollin through the hood, and them little niggas stay strapped
What can I say, black? B.G. is heartless
Usin one-time as targets, I warned you not to start this
Cause he's down with some down-ass niggas from around the way
It be that way, they got they nuts off fo' deep, and they down to play
Anything you hoes wanna do
(Well, bust a right at the light, come back and bomb that corner, fool)
Four young niggas ready to fuck your cap up
Left three niggas dead, and you thought they wouldn't act up?
Zip the sack up, and wipe the blood off of the flo'
Started some shit, and now they got everybody at each other's throats
Kinda fucked up, but that's the way it be

When I get bent I must represent, no question
Get up a dime spot and then I'm off to the dread section
Roots hit me off lovely
Coming out the spot I had to duck because a nigga tried to buck me
I'm easing on the Glock like, ""What up, hop""
Buck's pulling out on cops cause I want free Glocks
What the fuck, bring your bitch-ass type brigade
Hitting them all, hand guns and hand grenades
Unreasonable the man that's wanted for murder
Got your block locked down, so don't come any further
In my clip is a .22 dum-dum
Oh yeah, I seen your moms, I hit her off with a jum
You know what I'm saying? Fret it or forget it
I'm like the short and fly so I'mma still get paid, I don't sweat it
I'm every MC's nightmare manifesting
A little shorty pushing the fact that I'm best in

Kid, don't front, I got you open in your dome

Don't front, you know I got you open, kid (Repeat x8)

Rest in peace to my niggas in the East
And all the real niggas that was shot by beast
Around the way all we do is spark mad ism
Ladies be like, ""Yo, he's Buckshot right there, that is him""
But let's get with the cipher, kid, pass the eight
So I can wet my lungs and blow smoke in your face
Word to Jah, niggas can't touch me, kid
Cause I'm too nice to do bids or ever hit skid
Fronts in the bottom of my teeth like whatever shit
On the real, gettin played, what, I never did
Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real niggas
The field niggas get the muthafuckin ill triggers
Word to Herb, lick shot with my verb
And keep my hand on my grip when I play the curb
I never got caught by a undercover DT
Nah chill E T&T can't see me
You grab mics from the ones I left broken
Kid, don't front, you know I got you open

[Verse 3]
Late at night I catch a buzz, then I write
The type of ill shit to make the mind feel tight
And be wanting to battle like every five minutes
But I'm in this like Guinness so that ass get finished
Straight from the floors of hell, feel the flame
You faggot ass, I heard your nickname's Blaine
I hit your brain and you felt the pain, maintain
When it comes to a battle you know the Buck reigns
I overthrow the flow, niggas be like, ""Yo, how'd you do that?""
Bitches be like ""Yo who that, you're all that, yo, true that""
Never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it
I used to make money, now I just take it
I do what I gotta do to bring you to the concrete
Bucking niggas down cause they think shit is sweet

Verse 1: {Malik}
Back in the day i stayed paid i slayed and slang them thangs
Never had shit no i never had a fuckin' thing
I didn't have Moms to spend time or curl back
I needed that fast money so i had to react
?
I hustle when i had to so my pockets could stay kinda fat
Never was a crab i never was a ?
Just do what i gotta do and break a nigga off somethin'
?
I just make em holla until he feels pain
Gimme your sneakers, money, clothes, rings, and your fuckin' chains
Cuz I-I I never could have shit
Who'd ever think id have this
I wasn't sure i had a window to throw out my pot of piss
Now-Now-Now this verse is to show whose life was worse
That's why im a bad boy ghetto bastard and always have to curse

{Chorus}
Back in the day when i was a teenager (X4)

Verse 2: {Jamal}

For Christmas i wish for a tip
My daddy never played catch
My mommy was addicted to crack because she had no self-respect
I used to walk the streets ? until my grandma took me away
But still i wasn't safe
But something changed i had someone to care for me
But still i never had a male influence around me
My momma, grandmama, auntie and uncle were strung out
The only time i got love is when i had money or some drugs
?
Until i start stealin thats when my people start to wonder
""Where you got it, When you got it, Can i have it, Can you give it to me so i can make some ends by sellin it?
Most of the time i used to give it to them but then my uncle Ed crossed over and made ducats by the minute get it?
Im never packin pop tarts for lunch, im packin 38 special thats why they call me Mr. Hotshot

{Chorus}

Verse 3 {Malik}

In Holly Hill they hate to see you smile love to see you frown
Can't get yourself up out the ghetto tryin to keep the next family down
But you know, thats how it ever was
If you can't have it you get it from the one who does
My momma did what she had to do to satisfy ?
But now i gotta go move my first packages
More sales and we was making money we couldn't stay in the 'jects had to get up and go
Niggas couldn't stand to see that and started snitchin to 5-0
In other words, rattin' like a mouse
They listened and listened and then they ran up in the fuckin' house
Trashed the crib the whole thing was a mess
They was takin everybody down puttin ? in DSS
? shed tears it was a cryin' shame right
That's when i met Naughty By Nature and they told me that everything was gonna be alright

{Chorus}

Verse 4 {Jamal}

13 on April 26 of 1992
But to my family its just another day another week
Jamal fuck you
Its the same shit different day so i just leave and go get
? from the neighbors if i can i shoot some hoop with my niggas on the corner
And ask them who they think the next goner's gonna be
Me or some markhead nigga around the way
Cuz they ? like they shit dont stink
I knew much better when i was a kid i stayed on the DL
But still i always heard people scream Jamal when shit went down
It's like when shit went down i was the number one suspect
It wasn't because of me it was because of my uncle Trevor
Never lived a normal everyday kid's life
Instead of after school activities I'm on the corner shootin dice at night
If you ain't from around don't come around
Because you won't leave with a smile you'll leave with a frown
On your face as you hear the words of a nine millimeter
Back in the days when i was a teenager

Yo it's finally on for real, duke
Brothers better recognize
Smif-N-Wessun up in the chain
Bucktown, Boot Camp, bring it son

Raise like a rock, on the block, where the cops carry
And the hard rocks carry, with props and black hearts
(Meet up with my people on the corner) {in the morn}
(Get zoned get {on} now prepare to get it {on})
What does it take, to get the brake in the world of snakes
And those who fake (may be a taste of this)
Ah, true, now what them gon' do, when Smif-N-Wessun come lookin for you
Sin! (I'm comin wit my Boot Camp Clik) Yea (My troops)
Bringin da Ruckus, Rock and the rap crew, that switch just to get loot

Just get to get rough and touch my chest, nothin less)

Git it on! (Smif-N-Wessun and we do it like this)

I got ya block on lock, now you gettin dropped
New on and on, {Smif-N-Wess, and we never shop}
(The underground flavor is major, I check ya later
Gotta get with my peeps and get paper)
No time for sleep, gotta hit the streets
With my peeps (get with Mr. Walt)
Tell him hit us off with this phat beat
(Hit the sack and rip the track back to back)
Feelin the vibe (come around the Clik, catchin contacts
We bringin drama to y'all wannabe) {Do me a favor}

""We did it like that and now we do it like this""

[Verse 1: Chubb Rock]
Now clock, kids, who got the cocaine?
Don't tell me it's the little kids on Soul Train
The metaphor sent from my brain to my jaw
It comes from other places, not the tinted faces
Journalistic values are yellow and then of course falters
You watch Channel Zero with that bitch Barbara Walters
She'll have you believe black invented crack
When President Lyndon had the formula way back
In '63 with Kennedy, yes the double cross
Remember that's when they blow his fucking head off
Vietnam vets come back looking like one-armed pets
Nixon bounced pure checks
No picket fence, no job, no 8-Cylinder car
Blue collar turns to bourgeois
Depressed in your chest, Demerol, for sess
No dough, crack in vials much less
Whitey can sell on the corners of Bushwick
Whitey can sell on the corners of Flatbush
White Tees can sell on the corners of Bed-Stuy
Pass the torch to that nigga guy
So just die, nigga, die, nigga
You're too black, you can't handle, you're too strong
Get high, fly clock next boost ya steal
In '95 we take back Ebbets Field

[Verse 2: O.C]
Brooklyn, traveling distance to party
Brooklyn, absent at functions, not hardly
Brooklyn, the name alone holds Godly
You don't know, you better ask somebody
Crack filled streets since '85
The beast getting paid to not bust, hookers drawers got crust
Claps clapping regular, hardcore niggas with
Fat gold chains, on the corner maintaining
Gold teeth flashing, stick-up kids playing in front of
Latin Quarters, keep home your daughters
Cause if bullets fly, watch the flaming
Ignorant ducks are shooting wilding, they're not aiming
One Easter, now I think about it, what a pity
Five people died in front of Skate City
Senseless, back then you was ill if you had a gun
People dashing flashing, damn no fun
Albee Square you couldn't shop too much cause
Fort Greene would hem ya wreck the fuck on up
You had Do or Die, East New York, mad hell
Fellas cutting school trooping to all go Maxwell
So many memories I can't manifest
Yo 'Ru, start where I finish and to Brooklyn, God bless

[Scratched Hook]
""Crazy ass Crooklyn kids""
""Represent the Brooklyn all-nighter""
""Crazy ass Crooklyn kids""
""Because it is, survival of the fittest""
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 3: Jeru the Damaja]
Listen cause for your mind I got the right nutrition
We keeps shit hard like fat asses and cases of Heineken
Here in Brooklyn, home of the warrior and villain
Trife type chicks, Top Billin's the anthem
Rastas smoke marijuana
Enterprising businessmen shoot dice on the corner
Excuse me while I light my spliff but some choose to sip
So bullets hit brains, when bottles hit lips
Clips whatever happened to 38 special
Now it's Desert Eagles, government issue
Probably the same one that killed Noriega
Chips that powered nuclear bombs power my Sega
Subliminal hypnotism and colonialism
Leave most niggas dead or in prison
In Crook-land, right hand cuts off the left hand
To spite the hand, jealous of the next man
So violent crimes, black on black plus mad crack to boot
Everybody can't rap, so most hustle and shoot
Make money money, get money, take money
I can't understand that concept cause Jah rules everything around me
Fire burns the unjust like arson larceny
Melt MC's with mental telepathy
With precision, we're slicing and dicing
Peace to the East New York, Perverted Monks, and Mike Tyson

[Verse 1]
Dirty rotten scoundrel, that's what I'm called, on the street
Could connive and cheat but rarely get beat
Ya see I'm streetwise, a con-game pro
Kickin the Bobby bullshit, too smart for Willie Bobo
Not stressin five-o, hot hand in cee-lo
Live in the land of crooks yes Brooklyn's the borough
Homicide central, East New York
Where the manic, depressive psycho murderers stalk
Walk, like a ninja, on the asphalt
Here talk is cheap, you're outlined in chalk
And there's more hardtimes, than on Good Times
And most niggas dedicate their life to crime
So I'm steady schemin, won't work for a dime
Used to get, tax free loot, all the time
Type slick can't fess on 'Ru, because
I'm the original dirty rotten scoundrel

[Verse 2]
Before trains were graffiti proof - I used to get loose
Dirty rotten, since the days of the deuce
Dirty, because of the skin I'm in, the fact I have -
Melanin, automatically, makes me a felon
Even though I'm righteous, rotten's what you're yellin'
But I'm not chain-snatchin, or drug-sellin
According to your books, you said I would be damned, like Ham
Scoundrel, opposite of the king that I am
You wanna get funny? We can get bummy
Take you to the East and back again money
Filthy putrefied trick, step past your sister
Challenge the Damaja, and you'll be his-to-
Ry, Mortal Kombat fatality
The Original, don't sing no R&B
Nasty, emcee deity, chop off domes -
With the poems that come out of my pi-ne-al
Gland, as I expand, you know who I am

[Verse 3]
Father of all stylin, I be whylin' on wax
We hack shit up, like big ax and little ax
Don't need toast to make you jump like bungee
Tracks real muddy, like Brooklyn's real grungy
When I come through, I clog up your sewer
Peep the maneuveur, drop the ill manure
So bring Mr. Clean, Drano, and Roto Rooter
No matter what you do, you can't get through the -
Crud that comes out of your system
You're another victim of Dirty Rotten
Dirt up, in your grill, so what ya gonna do
But pay homage to...

640,5962,Arrested Development,Ease My Mind,13,1994-05-28,"

I need some time to ease my mind

Thrusted in a world that I don't know
From my mamas lips between my mamas hips
I'm cuddled by her hands because she understands
It's that bond that keeps the movement movin' on
Life is surrounded with so many insecurities
Back stabbin' is like breathing when in poverty
I try to make my sanity, with the insane
God is secondary to most, when they scrap for money
But, then again money can cause even more death
When a African becomes a nigga step n fetch n all
I dare say when price is right U can buy us all
Well not me, cuz I don't truly give a care about you
I'll move in poverty, in wealth but I'll surely move!
Ain't syncopated with your beats or your wack grooves
My break beat is to break away from yo thang
All these things you put on me makes this brother sing...

Chorus:
I need some time to ease my mind

Mind & soul is even more important then body
Money can put my body in all exotic spaces
Meanwhile my mind & soul remotely dwells
Within that fine spot between all messed up & hell
And so I move on with confidence of harmony
And do my thang to resist this wack society
Cuz if you don't resist, & I mean consciously
You'll fool your sub-conscious into accepting it
I ain't acceptin' it - I keep my focus
I keep my focus - I ain't acceptin'it
Give me a face pencil to draw a smile on me
Answer my prayer to give my Earthly body inner peace
Answer my prayer to give my Earthly
Body
Inner
Inner peace
Until that day upon which my souls released!

Chorus

Need some time need some time
When the sista's say it then you know it's gotta be real!

Thrusted in a world that I don't know
From my mommas lips between my mamas hips
I'm cuddled by her hands because she understands
It's that bond that will keep the movement movin' on
It's that bond that will keep the movement movin' on
And so I GOTTA BE READY TO RELINQUISH
Gotta be ready to relinquish, my breath of life for struggle

That is why I tell you...

I need some time to ease my mind

Come on y'all let's take a ride
Don't you say shit just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
Cause you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
Grab your gat with the extra clip and
Close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it
Kick it, kick it, yeah, that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin', ain't no crippin'
Ain't no punk-ass niggas set trippin'
Everybody's got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black, I
Wanna take you there like the Staple Singers
Put something in the tank and I know that I can bring ya
If you can't take the heat get your ass out the kitchen
We on a mission
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
With switches on the block in a '65
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide who-ride
No valley low enough for mountain high

I'm trying to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice, a
Place where my kids can play outside
Without living in fear of a drive-by
And even if I get away from them drive-by killers
I still got to worry about those snitch-ass niggas
I keep on searching and I keep on looking
But niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be acting like they evil
You don't understand about running with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang, and
You don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
I do what I do just to survive
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide who-ride
That's why I pack my .45

Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of the apple pie
Every game ain't the same, cause the game still remains
Don't it seem kinda strange, ain't a damn thing change
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down-ass niggas can ride with me
Hop-hop-hop your five quickly down the block
Stay sucka-free and keep the busters off your jock
You gotta have heart son, if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot swing low
Ain't nobody cryin' ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worried, everybody's tryin'
Nothin' from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you wanna have something, you better start frontin'
What ya gonna do when the 5 roll by
You better be ready, so you can ride

Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide slippity-slide
When you're living in a city it's do or die
Come along and ride on a fantastic voyage
Slide slide who-ride
You better be ready when the 5 roll by
Just roll along- that's what you do
Just roll along- that's right
Just roll along- that's what you do
Just roll along- that's right
Do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me
Do you want to ride with me,do you want to ride with me
Do you want to ride with me, do you want to ride with me
Do you want to ride with me,do you want to ride with me

Yo Mona Lisa, could I get a date on Friday?
And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking
Saturday-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Round up de posse, Fugee comin' around the way

(Wyclef) Yo, hey nappy head
(Lauryn) Yo whashup?
(Wyclef) What you got there?
(Lauryn) Hah, I got some of that lyrical cheeba cheeba
(Wyclef) Worrrrrd?

A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all
A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all

[Verse One: Wyclef]
You wanna battle? Swing
I bring commanding men like I was king
In all your dreams I write the horror flick of Stephen King
Cling to false also those papers say ock
I got tired of the fat lady so I sing to my own opera
Ba-lang-balang-balang-to-de-man-de-rock-cause I love thee
If you live by the sword you will be die by the gun
Cause all guys tell lies, and more girls commits sin
I was ordered to Code Red, but now I'm chillin' with A Few Good Men
Assassination on the kid from the capitol
I never play the soap opera but now I'm in General Hospital
Condition critical, spirit over who's the physical
So if I die, catch me at the funeral
I'll fly away, ohh glory
With a mic in my hand to a land where only God knows me
And the angels write raps on holy paper
I said I'm lookin for Jesus, he said ""Take the escalator
One flight up, is guaranteed He'll be there""
My sister'd be there, my mother'd be there
So...

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Lauryn Hill]
I don't puff blunts so I always got my breath
Never had to battle with a bullet proof vest
They call me cock-weasel but I, still cave a chest
I don't wear Jheri curls cause I'm not from the West
No disrespect to the West, true indeed
I rock it to the East, the East is the seed
To see that them days back, yo sheepskins and Hot Tracks
Peace to Mr. Magic, things are getting tragic
Now we on some new stuff, I never feared the Ku Klux
My own clan is actin up, I blame it on the Phillie blunt
What you gonna do, kids are acting oooohhhh
Hill is gettin' badder, yo where's the corporate ladder?
Mr. Three Piece Suit
Check the square roots, Girbauds and Timberland boots
Nahhhh that's the serpents, and know them garment tips
I got a head full of problems and a hand full of nappy roots
I feel a Jones comin' down, yo I...
[Wyclef:]
(I got the slang to make the chitty-bang-bang
A-rid-dang-de-dang, the nappy head bang)
[Lauryn:]
No I, got the slang to make the chitty-bang-bang
A-rid-dang-de-dang, the nappy heads reign!

[Hook]
Nappy heads in the zone and we're not goin' home!

[Verse Three: Pras]
Hey yo a battle is a battle but a battle's not a battle
If it'sssssssssss snake doesn't rattle
Cause my style's as old as a reptile
As slick as a Nu Nile, as new as a new child
So come follow me to the land of Abraham
This land's your land, this land's my land
The blacker the black man, the better the next man
[Lauryn:]
(Yo some nappy heads need to check they necks for red)
[Wyclef:]
Ihhhh, feel injection
Put the needle to your skin feel reality's heroin
You maintain to put a negro in pain you used to diss me
""Oh you wanna hang with old Eddie Kane?""
Ain't nuttin wrong, snap your head to the song
Word is bond, you get wrong
I'll have you sing like Louis Armstrong
And I say to myself, what a wonderful world
But what the hell was so wonderful 'bout cotton in the farm
Mr. Slaaaaaave Maaaaan!
The harder they come, the harder they fall, so come one come all
Don't stall or I'mma stick you like a voodoo doll
Doors locked stop drawer for the count who drops
You slept on a kid from the boondocks
Out of Hootaville, land of the ill kill
Vailsburgh Viking so you know I'm top ranking Phil
Some say who coming like like the yuma but save the rumor
Cause I've been rockin ever since eighty-two
When I used to rock my Pumas...

Yes, yes y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all (4X)

[Hook]
Nappy heads in the zone and we're not goin home!

[Outro: 2x]
I wear my sunglasses at night
To spy on my girlfriend that's right
They dancing, romancing, freaking at night!
Yes yes yes a yes yes y'all

[Verse 1: Q-Tip]
Listen up everybody, the bottom line
I'm a black intellect, but unrefined
With precision like a bullet, target bound
Just living like a hooker, the harlot sounds
Now when I say the harlot, you know I mean the hot
Heat of the equator, the broth that's in the pot
Jalick, Jalick ya wind up ya hip
Drafting of the poets, I'm the #7 pick
Licks licks licks boy 'pon your backside
Licks licks licks boy 'pon your backside
Listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide
Tip the earthly body, heaven's on my side
Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo
We got mics, when do we go?
Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask me
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
1 for the treble, 2 for the bass
You know the style Tip, it's time to flip this
I like my beats hard like two day old shit
Steady eating booty MCs like cheese grits
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
But just in case I own more condoms than T.L.C
Now the formula is this: me, Tip, and Ali
For those who can't count it goes 1-2-3
The anti batty boy, big up is who I be
Brothers find this hard to do but never me
Some brothers try to diss but Malik, you see 'em bitching
Me no care about them dibby MC, my shit is hitting
Trini gladiator, anti-hesitater
Shaheed push the fader from here to Grenada
Mr Energetic, who me sound pathetic?
When's the last time you heard a funky diabetic?
(I don't know man, I don't know man, I don't know man)
(I don't know, I don't know)

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Oh my God, yes, oh my God
(Repeat x8)

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Complementary are we, the three for poetry
I got a humdinger coming hook line and sinker
The Timbo hoofs with the prints on the ground
Timbos on the toes, I like the way it's going down
Down like a lady of the evening
When it goes in Toots just believe it's in
Cause Queens is the county, Jamaica is the place
Take off your cleats cause you can't run the race

Yo, first no one knew that my skill were tight
That I could rock a mic all long and stay right
Man listen, when it come to rhymes I smell them
I got lyrics locked in my cerebellum
In other words brainstem
Like my man Rakim said, I'm better than the rest of them
I'm a tid bit smoother
I bust a rap like a Luger
I'm dreamy like Krueger
Smooth B, real in the flesh
Greg Nice my counterpart keepin the vibe fresh
And we can go on
From night to morn
Rippin the mic and leave the stage torn
Never in a scuffle
Cause i can chill in the Bronx
And still do the Hollywood Shuffle
Take it back to the essence
To the jams in the park, ahh everesence
Felt like yesterday
When I was a shorty b-boy around the way
Cango, nylon, Nike suits and Pumas
I had girls from here to Montezuma
Now things are pretty much the same
But I don't have to rhyme for free and that's the price of fame
I had to learn alot to protect myself
From those that want what I got
Now, I can be the same like a ?pamphlet?
And before they bight, I throw a damn fit
I gotta keep makin papers
I got no time for no corn ball capers
So here's a word from the wise
If you tryin ask me, your in for a big surprise

Yo, bro, I'm half Indian, so you're right
I'mma about to show you wit my mic sword
Yo Shaolin sling, come on raise the sword
Charge, they all crowd from the Black Fist
I got fudge in my mouth, they say that'll let your own wrist
M.C.'s fall and they can't get up
I do the rap, why, yes that's a cut
Huh, right back at you, niggas better run
Or feel the force of the Hell Razah's gun
Gupao, gupao, my style is wild chopped in the Shao'
Zoo, aow, aow, I can flip it acapello
I'll make you jelly like Jell-O, figaro, figaro
Who would think that the Just would go opera
You could ask Hammer, he know my shit is popper
Stopper, stopper, like Cuddy Ranks

By the kiss of the Black Fist
Shit is sick, here to make ya wanna drown a fish
Under water, I'mma slaughter, like a change machine wit no quarter
Out of order, run for the border

Straight up crook, meaner than Captain Hook
Look out, look out, stomp like Bigfoot
And I don't give a fuck about a girl

The Drunken Monk is so funky, they call me manure
Horse shit, I flip shit, oh my God, I rip shit
I talk shit, no one can shit, like I shit
Shit like this, get you upset
Because the shit that I was singin, was pumpin through ya projects

[Intro: Judge (Lawyer) [​Woman​​]
[​​​They killed my baby, oh God they killed my baby]​​​
Order in the court, order in the court
​​[I will make you pay for this you murderers]
[I said order in the court now
Now, before this court passes judgement
Will the four defendants please rise and approach the bench
(Trust me guys, it's all under control
The judge is my uncle, he'll take the insanity plea
Oh yeah, don't forget my retainer balance
Okay, I understand you guys are pleading insanity claiming
Demonic spirits possessed you to do these hideous murders
Can you please explain to the court how these so called spirits made you into these raving madmen]

Verse 1: [Shabazz the Disciple]
Bear witness as I exercise my exorcism
The evil that lurks within the sin, the terrorism
Possessed by evil spirits, voices from the dead
I come forth with Gravediggaz in a head full of dread
I've been examined ever since I was semen
They took a sonogram and seen the image of a demon
At birth nurses surrounded me with needles
And drugged me all up with the diseases of evil
Grew up in Hell, now I dwell in an Islamic temple
I’m fighting a holy war in the mental
Look deep into my eyes you'll see visions of death
Possessed by homicide is what I am obsessed
Giving niggas brain dimples
Dragging their asses on my hook by their temples
The cause of death is unknown to the cops
Cause when I kill 'em, I’m not leaving one element to autops'
First I'll assassinate him, and them I'll cremate him
Then take all of his fucking ashes and evaporate him
I'll creep through the graveyard and hunt down your tombstone
Dig up your skeleton and stomp all your fucking bones
You try to haunt me nigga, I ain't tryna hear it
Buck buck buck, I'll give your ass a holy spirit

[Break: Judge (Poetic)]
(Stressful, try to avoid all my impure thoughts, I am losing my mind
And it seems I don’t know what’s true or dream)
[Can you please explain to the court
When these problems first began?]

[Verse 2: RZArector]
The year '84, November, day 10
Overwhelmed by the wicked inspirations of an evil djinn
I realize my ideas have spawned for 400 years
Of blood sweat and tears
I saw the torture, brutal murder of my father
So my brain became stained with the horror
I'm having reoccurring nightmares
Of being soaking wet, strapped down to the electric chair
I got tackled with handcuffs and shackled in restraint
At the bottom of a holy tabernacle
They gave me nothing to eat for two weeks
And sewed my eye lids open so I couldn't sleep
About to die from thirst, that's when the minister
Quenched my jaws with a cold glass of vinegar
Upon my wounds they seasoned me with salt
And nailed my hands feet to the form of a cross
Ahh!! I cry
As the blood drips inside of my eye refusing to die
Visions of Hell tormented my faith
So I chewed my fucking arm off and made an escape

[Break: Judge (jury)]
(Your arm?! No way God dammit)
(Oh no, me mataron mi amigo, hijo de la gran puta
Esos cogines me mataron mi amigo que voy a cerca carajo, cono)
[Calm down people, please calm down
Let us please proceed with the defendants' explanation ]

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Enter the realms of understanding
And take good heed or you could bleed while I’m scanning
Three stages of pure Hell, 16 pages of red cells
*Shh* rain drops hits the pails
Path is dull and narrow, you're stalked by a shadow
I'll pierce your skull with the fucking arrow
So narrow, only one could enter at a time
Stuck in the center, read the signs
A thousand doors to choose, you better hurry
Don’t stop, shit is getting hot as a pot of curry
On your right side there’s fire, your left, deep waters
Watch your step, it's deep waters
What's that coming through the floor? It's a claw
*pssh* took his fucking ass to the fucking core
(ahhh!!)

[Verse 4: Frukwan]
Stroll through the dark conditions
I stone you till I see sparks of friction
I chop ya like a coal miner
Then combine the drug and mix it with your blood
Some more, I give you some moreand watch you crawl
Guts hit the floor, worms exit your pores
I trick ya, ha, then I'm quick to syringe
Deep into my thoughts and bust out your skin
You scream, portraits of inflictable pain, you can't stand
You're up to your hands in quicksand
You're sinking and sinking deep into the earth
Thoughts was possessed since the first day of birth
My mental says it's my turn to possess the matter
Stab you with a dagger up Jacob's ladder
Thoughts become shattered, confused and tragic
Fiery thoughts of Gravediggaz

Guilty, next case

Rolling steady in that Caddy but them 50 bottles got to go

Where nothing but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale, swell
Swollen got my pockets
Business booming like rockets
Folks try to stop it but they know that it's that

[Hook : Choir]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
Time to drop these 'bows like Dusty Rhodes
Then I yell ho
We knocking em off they feet like a Southern hustler supposed to do
I's in the house, house like a joint is lit fo my kin folks
And all the niggas that was down, since we been broke
Taking em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
Look my crew be thick as two fat hoes sitting off in a Brougham
I'm packing my tag backwards if you want to be acting wrong
Word is bond like super glue, it's funky like poopa scoop
And every word I say you can true

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Well okey dokey KastOut
I swear to God I got the highest booming Cadillac
The expialalistic coupe de ville can you handle that you rat?
I take my time cruising round the city malls
And under my seat for you suckers it's your final curtain call
The one two to the gauge, p-u-m-p
You want to do a jack, I heat the barrel til it's empty, get me
See I get friendly getting in where I fit
Organized is on the track with the southernplayalistic shit
So copy my slang and bite my shit but don't try gaffling me
Cause sleeping you'll get served with some Southern hospitality

[Hook : Choir]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

[Verse 5: Big Boi]
Well Southernplayalisticadillac music has been laid
I may wait for all the - be rolling like that today hoes
So back up off get up on it if you want it ya'll
Looking for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball yup
So now I step, rather walk with the pimp limp
While my niggas are at East Point
With that College Park, hemp-smoke style
Is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac

[Verse 6: Andre 3000]
Step up in my shoes you crews sitting on Trues
And Vogues for the hoes only when we rolling through
Atlanta skies be blue
The sun is beaming it seeming
That I glisten, rather gleaming
20/20 got me leaning to the side
Full of pride
Now ain't that something
I'm dipping into your hood, this ain't braille but I'm bumping
Thumping out the roaches
Dungeon if y'all missed it
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, PA, Outkast
Southernplayalistic

[Hook : Choir]
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high
It's that Southernplayalisticadillac funky music
Now players if you choose it
You better make sure you don't abuse it
We gonna get cha high, high

Rack 'em up, crack 'em up, stack 'em up against the gate
The homies tryin' ta catch me but they cain't, wait

And we plan-on makin' hellafied mount of money (hell yeah)
And what I did for extra fees
Was break niggas after work playin' get like me
I was fourteen years old, havin' a sack
Just a young motherfucker eatin' ValuPaks

[Intro: Gladys Knight]
Hey, you know, everybody's talking about the ""good old days,"" right? Everybody! The good old days
Well, let's talk about the good old days!

[Raekwon]
Know what I'm sayin'?
Take you on this lyrical high real quick
1993 exoticness, know what I'm sayin'?
Let's get technical; where's your bone at?
Get up on that shit, a'ight? Yo!

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Started off on the island, aka Shaolin
Niggas wilin', gun shots thrown, the phone diallin'
Back in the days, I'm 8 now
Makin' a tape now, Rae gotta get a plate now
Ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one
'Til I got (Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!) felt one
Yeah, my pops was a fiend since 16
Shootin' that ""that's that shit!"" in his blood stream
That's the life of a grimy, real-life crimey
And niggas know that habit's behind me
Day one, yo, growin' all up in the ghetto
Now I'm a weed fiend jettin' to Palmetto
In Medina, yo, no doubt, the god got crazy clout
Pushin' the big joint from down South
So if you're filthy stacked up, better watch your back and duck
'Cause these fiends, they got it cracked up
Now my man from up North, now he got the loft
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes, I'm not playin', get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put him in a yoke
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot
(Yo, Rae, don't do that shit, man! Don't do that shit!)
Fuck that!

[Hook: Raekwon + (Ghostface Killah)]
Dedicated to the winners and the losers
(Dedicated to all Jeeps and Land Cruisers)
*Can it be that it was all so simple then?*
Dedicated to the 5's, 850i's
(Dedicated to niggas who do drive-by's)
*Can it be that it was all so simple then?*
Dedicated to the Lexus and the Ac's
(Dedicated to MPV's: phat!)

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah (Raekwon)]
Kickin' the fly clichés, doin' duets with Rae and A
Happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of bustin' off shots, havin' to rock knots
Runnin' up in spots and makin' shit hot
I'd rather flip shows instead of those
Hangin' on my livin' room wall, my first joint and it went gold!
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight, gettin' my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now it's just a big dream
'Cause I find myself in a place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain
'Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone and everybody's doin' bad
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passin' away, I gotta make wakes
Receivin' all types of calls from Upstate
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure, settlin' for lesser
The God left lessons on my dresser
So I can bloom and blossom, find a new way
To continue to make more hits with Rae and A
Sunshine plays a major part in the daytime
Peace to mankind, Ghostface carry a black 9, nigga
Word up, it's all like that… yeah)

It's like this, I'ma start from the top
Inspectah Deck, he's like

And see you sit there and know you lyin'
And he'll take you to court after that
'Cause he the Inspectah, that's why he the and
And also he the Rebel I.N.S.
You know what I'm sayin'?
And Shallah Raekwon, he the Chef
He cookin' up some marvelous shit to get your mouth waterin'
On some ""oh shit""
Then, then it's, then it's the Method Man

Basically Method Man is like
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it
And then Baby U, he a psychopathic

So what's like, I mean what's like
Your ultimate goal against in this in this industry?

[Method Man]
Domination, baby, fuck that

[Raekwon]
Can I say this one? Can I say this one?
Right now, right now, we still, we still
Feel like we ain't get what we want yet
When we get, when we get, when we get a little props
And really really get the way we gotta go
That's when you know it's on
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause right about now, I ain't braggin' or nothin'
But yo, the Wu, the Wu got somethin'

You know you're too good to be forgotten
Papa wasn't there but there was Lance in the house
And so, to me and Mommy, you the man of the house
Always flip the script back to the old days

Back then I didn't blaze
Switched to the pipe with the peace these days

Attack it with my tactics

I'm happy to get with you
But you can't come out to play right now
You got to much shit to do
It's all game

Them suckers know my name is
Sitting on the tips of their brains
But they're ashamed
They scared to face me
Yet they want to disgrace me, erase me
They must be freaking crazy
I'm the La La La from Halstead
Bred with the Queen as a prefix
It's off with your head
And that's a promise cause I don't make threats
So mind your neck, cause it's about to get set

I guess like the jeans - uh
Flavor like Praline, sick daddy nah'mean
Papa love it, when he does it
Niggas buzz it
But tell me was it really just the flavor that be clogging your ears
The most healthy behavior is to stay in the clear
It's all for you, it's really all for you
(Now what)
Hunchback, close your eyes try to munch that
Coil up your ankles let your Timbs tap
Bite the flavor it reacts to your gold caps
Word to Mama, I tongue kiss a piranha
Electrocute a barracuda, I'm here to bring the drama

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yo! Yo! Yo!
Flavors in your ass crease ha
Busta Rhymes about to bring the noise don't cease ha
Let me loose from the belly of the beast ha
Everybody, hey hey hey
You better believe it's Busta Rhymes the great
We 'bout to rip the Tri-State
Yo yo, hey hey hey
I'll split your face and give you stitches
Throw niggas in ditches, slap the ass of fat bitches
Wait one sec, as I get down
I'm rolling with the heavyweight connect to the stomping ground
Now, don't you get suspicious
I grant your wishes every time
Bring it vicious when I bust a rhyme
I know one thing the whole world least expected is how we all connected
To break food on the same record
Five new flavors on a beat, feel the fucking heat
I really think you should retreat while we blow up the street
Instead of copping pleas just freeze
Maintain the focus while we smoke these marijuana trees
When I get down I disappear, reappear and blow up
Everywhere, fucking with these flavas in ya ear

[Hook:]
Here comes the brand new flava in ya ear
Time for new flava in ya ear
I'm kicking new flava in ya ear
Mack's a brand new flava in ya ear

"
663,6241,The Lady Of Rage,Afro Puffs,17,1994-08-13,"

[Hook (x2)]
[Rage] I rock rough and stuff with my Afro Puffs (rage)
[Snoop] Rock on, wit cha bad self

[Verse 1: The Lady of Rage]
I rock on with my bad self cause it's a must
It's the Lady Of Rage still kickin up dust
So umm, let me loosen up my bra strap
And umm, let me boost ya with my raw rap
Cause I'mma break it down to the nitty-gritty one time
When it comes to the lyrics I gets busy with mine
Busy as a beaver, ya best believe-a
This grand diva's runnin shit with the speed of a cheetah, meet a
Lyrical murderer... I'm servin em like two scoops of chocolate
Check it how I rock it
I'm the one that's throwin bolos, ya better roll a Rolo
To find out I'm the number one solo, uhh
The capital R-A now take it to the G-E
I bring the things to light, but you still can't see me
I flow like a monthly you can't cramp my style
For those that try to punk me here's a Pamprin child
No need to say mo', check the flow
Rage in effect once mo', so now ya know

[Hook]

[Verse 2: The Lady of Rage]
Now I'm hittin' MC's like Hadouken *Street Fighter sound*
Ain't no doubt about it I'm the undisputed
So what you uhh, wanna do is back on up
I'll tap that butt, wax the cuts, pass the bucks
So put your money on the bread winner
I kick lyrics so dope that the brothers call 'em head spinners
I got the tongue that is outdone anyone
From the rising to the setting of the sun
Or the moon, I consume the room with doom
When I hear the kick of a 808 bass ... POOM
BOOM, BAM, God, DAYUMMMMMM!
I'm hittin so hard you could say it's a grand, slam, dunk, punks
Get broken off for chunk when they feel the funk
Of the rhythm (fresh) that I give em
Let it hit em, split em, did it now I'm rid of em, yeah
I put that on my unborn kids
Rage in effect so you know how it is

[Hook (x2)]

[Verse 3: The Lady of Rage]
Now ever since my debut, I've continued to lay you
Flat on your back from the raps that I spat, spit
Ohh shit, I'm the shit!
You can't get wit the Rage then tough tit-tie
I pi-ty the fool, that gets
With the lyrical murderer cause my shit is rude (OOOH!)
You wanna get with the wickedness? With that
Big bot-ty that's kickin it, rippin it apart like Jason
You'll be, chasin a dream like Freddy
Are you ready for the cream de la creme?
I'm steam pressurin those who ain't measurin up
I keep competitors stuck
In the muck with they butt up, what chu wanna nut up
Like cashew, don't you know that I will mash you? For real
That's the deal, I'm straight out of Farmville, VA
(So what you gotta say?)

[Hook] x2

Huhh
I am the roughest, roughest, roughest (Say what? Say what?)
I am the toughest, toughest, toughest (RAGE!)
(repeat x4)

Get with the uhh, roughest, roughest
Get with the uhh, toughest, toughest (RAGE!)
Get with the uhh, roughest, roughest (Yeah)
Get with the uhh, toughest, toughest (RAGE!)
Get with the uhh, wickedness, roughest
I am the uhh, wickedness (RAGE!)

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, one-nine-nine-fo'
The indo blow and the grass grow
Snoop Doggy Dogg still don't love a ho
But you gotta give credit when credit is due
Women back down and bow down to my motherfuckin homegirl
The Lady of Rage
She rocks rough and stuff with the Afro Puffs
Handcuffed and she busts
And trick biatch, she's guaranteed to tear shit up
Y'know what I'm sayin?

Verse One: Mondo, Vex

I can see your only eyes, locked into your skull
My backbone the zone and when I roam my mind is full
Guess who? I'm swoopin through the air like pestilence
I know your nerves are shot and skin is tight from my presence
Got the aura of a gazelle and roll like an ox
I linger in the air and make my vocals bust shots
To your dome, I'm thicker than a junkie's nostrils on 'cain
The membrane, of a party, nucleus of the brain
The Cytoplasm, is gettin phatter as it grows
And expansions of the soul so blow the trash out the nose dig within
Your mental will extend upon arrival of the truth the spiritual
Ya hear it nigga you'll get loose
So light the wick and let's get busy
Like a stick into your teeth
I override the threshold, and take it back to the sea
Who can it be? Dance up in the party
Come and grab the microphone, come and move my body

Well I came through the door, I said it before
I never let the stress get me down anymore
So as we walk through the thresholds of snake in the grass
I thought of super vicious shapes, lyrics begin to mass
Feel the blast as the format of the rap smakcs the skit
No profanity but the tongue is rough spit
Verbal vomit, strings the atomic
Some electrospectroscopic storm, rising from the quorum
It's like what? All up in your grill as we be strokin to the doom
Eliminating gloom as we walk in
With the WalkMan's on, turned up to ten
Apocalypse is comin, Boogiemonsters', transcend
With the
Dan-ne-na, dan-ne-na
Dan-ne-nanny-yah on your block
Rock the ill one for energy, blesses as the mess
Penetrates the thresholds of negative stress

Chorus: Repeat 2X

[Dan-ne-na, dan-ne-na] The recognized thresholds of negative stress
[Dan-nah-nah-neyaa] The recognized thresholds of negative stress

Verse Two: Yodared, Myntric

I like the bare back when I rip my rap on the track
MC's be beggin for mercy, but we don't be cuttin no slack, see
Yoda's on attack and Myntrick got my back
Peep the ver-nacular, cause I don't know how to act

Spectacular, back you up like Dracula
Feedin off the energies, flip em like french toast I be the spatula
My man my blackness, we're, comin through the fatness
The drifter, floatin to the mist of the wackness

Attack us like a virus, look into my iris
Save that Achey Breaky Heart stuff for Billy Ray Cyrus
Just one of four Jugganauts, breakin down the walls
I fall into my zone and I realize all

So bring the noise b-boys, cause we're back
Peep the naked flow, bust the dreaded afro check the track
And plus the microphone, when I take you back
Represent the Boogie Down, moster when the sound hold me black

Chorus:

Verse Three: Vex, Mondo

Well it's the taker of the took-en, the shaker of the shook-en
My head will bop and rock like the niggas bop in Brooklyn
On the block, so you don't stop
And ya don't stop when I rock and the nine goes pop

Remember me, I be the kid with the Catholic uniform
But nowadays, ahh, the girlies just swarm
I don't know why, I'm walkin through the negative stress
Ghinga levi, is use-ful and still may get the thresh

Well I'm that little peasy-headed kid from back in the day
The one that could run fast, cut and go the other way
And run a three-eight forty, leave ya in the chills
Leave ya at the twenty standin still holdin ya dillz

I used to get frustrated with my NikeAirs
It never matched my wears, I used to be in tears
I used to be chillin, I used to roll dice
Nowadays I'm thrillin, my wears are twice as nice

And nice on the rhyme flip, watch how my rhyme tip
Just gets more complex, as we come, let me say my name is Vex
Fe fi fo fum, ho hum, yes I said it, before
But bring it in, Mondo, my man cause he got more

One day I be the rich and famous sittin in my Nova
Scoopin chicks, gettin chicks, to flip like bend over
Got my powerful, ice-ring, and everybody's witness
And the swing techniques, so flow you fly freak

So in ninety-four, yo, it's all about the music
Here it comes, spiritually, now you can, use it
So ah, eliminate the worst and the best
And eliminate the threshold, of negative stress

668,6298,Bone Thugs-N-Harmony,Thuggish Ruggish Bone,24,1994-08-27,"

[Produced by DJ U-Neek]

[Intro]
We're not against rap
We're not against rappers
But we are against those thugs (thugs thugs)

[Hook]
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone [x4]

[Verse 1 - Layzie Bone]
You're feelin' the strength of the rump
Step up, hear the funk of the jump that the thugstas feel
Just be thuggin', straight buzzin', lovin' your peoples cause we so real
Chill, better bring your weapon when steppin', bring on that ammunition
Trip and don't slip, not to mention, never knew no competition
But I gotta get mine, so scream out ""mo'!"" and let me hear ya holla
Not about that mighty dollar, roll with the Bone, Mo' Thugs will follow
Chain gang remaining the same, flaming my dank and drinking brew
Thinking about hanging, clocking my bank, and thuggin' trues, foo's

[Hook]
It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone [x4]

[Verse 2 - Wish Bone]
Get ready for the Bone and the Mo' Thug, bustas, you know me as a hustla
Try to creep and get deep, Maybe 6 feet, peep, gotta put them under
Straitjackets, gotta make that money, man, it's still the same now
Bailin' in my black trench vest, you gotta be down to bang-bang
Come and get this, teaching you soldiers how thugstas must stack
Me drinkin' me brew 'till me skull crack wig blew all the way back

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Krayzie Bone]
Now follow me now, roll, stroll off deep in the land
Well, creep if you can, take another swig to the brain (whoa)
Loc'in, steady chokin' off that potent smoke
And running from the po-po now
Gotta get up with me thugstas, right? Turn to the Double Glock
Pull to the curb, smoke with my hustlas, puff, puff puff to the brain, shot
Love P.O.D.ed and tweeded, gotta get another case for my trunk
Olde English, really don't need it, but in case my trues wanna get drunk
They pump Bone, so leave 'em alone you don't wanna get shut down
Thug runnin' the nine-quad and you better believe they be wanting this thug style
So what now? see the Bone Thug claim, Thug never gonna change, so flame up
Sit back and just smoke the same cut, leatherface on the creep, I came up

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Bizzy Bone]
Gotta give it on up to the Glock-Glock, pop-pop, better drop when them buckshot blow
The Bone in me never no hole, so no creepin' up outta the Ziplock
So Sin: sip gin, and Lil Mo Hart: run up, nut up and flipped in
Then slipped the clip in, mistakin' the bloody victims
Ever if you test, nuts to the chest and put 'em to rest, but I won't test bucks
Put a hole up into me vest and gotta get through my soul, but they won't budge
Mud, drug me victim, the blood in me running my mental
The thug in me stuck in me keeping it simple, the bud in me runnin me pencil, so
To the temple, buck when you duck to the thuggish ruggish T's
St. Clair P's to appeal to the G's and a buck to all my enemies

[Chorus]

We got Layzie
And Krayzie
Bizzy's in the house
Wish is in the house
And Flesh
And Shatasha
Cleveland
Definitely in the house
It's the thuggish ruggish bone
It's the thuggish ruggish bone

Check Check It Out Check it Out
Check Check It Out Check it Out
PMD's in tha house
Check Check It Out Check it Out
Hit Squad In the house
Check Check It Out Check it Out
Word Em' up, Blackzone, Hitsquad

[Verse 1]
Grab ya head nigga, start bobbin it
The underground's bein' shook down, PMD's robbin it
So crack the old gold, yeah, and spark the Phillie blunts
I'm chumpin niggas down takin minds on a manhunt
(Quote unquote kid), dont get caught up in the gunsmoke
It's rap huntin' season, and I'm blastin niggas who showboat
With that pretty-boy R&B rap, back with a hiphop track - say that, Сause thats whack, and niggas ain't trying to hear that
Can't get sidetracked, so bust the impact
To get the bozack, and mind yo beeswax
Still in the game but somethin' changed

[Chorus]
Went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
(I saw it cummin, thats why i went solo)
X5

[Verse 2]
What's this - another funky hit from the squad kid?
No time for comebacks black, time to run shit
So pass that microphone, plug it into the soundboard
Scratch cuts the wax, chop it like a chainsaw
So who's callin my name?
Been doin' this since 87' cause this is my thing
Can't forget Jane haircut, like Anita Baker
Never seen no one faker, to make the mistake to
Try to push up on a brother, who brainstorms
You know I'm psycho, crazy, like that man Nor-man Bates
Wait, excuse me but it's the ism
That makes me hesitate, no time to translate
Gotta go kid, time to motivate
Back to the blackzone, cause it's no thing

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
What's up with all these corny niggas
Makin faces on my TV screen
Can't shoot this tube, cause if I do it makes 19
No time for the crime scene
Grab my Bozack, and my mic, time to beam
Back to the underground, home of beat-downs
Drop some ill shit like this, for the niggas to leave round town
Hardcore, hittin' switches In the '64
3-wheel motion, or the Benz with the 4-door
Troopin past the local spot
Niggas wanna act up, and Niggas catch the speedknot
Not trying to promote viloence But thats the way it is
The code of the ghetto ain't got shit to do with showbiz
Remember that
Yeah, still bustin' brains, yeah

[Chorus]

Hit squad in the house, PMD records in effect
24-hour representin'
Went solo on that ass but it's still the same
Big shout-out to KRS-one
Went solo on that ass but it's still the same

[Intro: Greg Nice]
Aww yeah, it’s another Gang Starr sure shot
Uh! featuring the one and only [?] Nice & Smooth
Hey, Gang Starr has gots to be the sure shot
Nice & Smooth has gots to be the sure shot
Gang Starr has gots to be the sure shot
Nice & Smooth has gots to be the sure shot

[Verse 1: Greg Nice]
Greg Nice! Greg N-I-C-E
Dame un beso, ah oui oui
Rock for a fee, not for free
Maybe I'll do it for charity
Now my employer or my employee
Is making Greg N-I-C-E very M-A-D
Don't ever ever think of jerking me
I work too hard for my royalty
Put lead in your ass and drink a cup of tea
Peace to Red Alert and Kid Capri
Ooohh la la, ah oui oui
I say Muhammad Ali, you say Classius Clay
I say butter, you say Parkay
It's alright if you wanna make a sway
I'm away uptown, took the deuce to the tre
I originate, they duplicate
I praise the Lord and keep the faith
It's alright, keep biting at the bait
'92, uh! One year later
Peace out, Premier, take me out with the fader

[Verse 2: Guru]
I chant 'eeny, meeny, miny, moe'
I wreck the mic like a pimp pimps hoes
Here's how it goes: I am a genius, I mean this
I shake this, you'll take this, I'm kinda fiendish
You wish that you could come into my neighborhood
Meaning my mental state, still I'm 5-foot-8
Crazy as I wanna be, ‘cause I make it orderly
You could say I'm sorta the boss so get lost
The brother who will make you change opinions
Dominions, I'm in them when it's time to kick shit from
The heart, plus I get a piece of the action
Feeling satisfaction from the street crowd reaction
Chumps pull guns when they feel afraid
Too late, when they dip in the kick, they get sprayed
Lemonade was a popular drink and it still is
I get more props and stunts than Bruce Willis
A poet like Langston Hughes
And can't lose when I cruise out on the expressway
Leaving the bodega I say ""suave""
Premier's got more beats than barns got hay
Clips are inserted into my gun
So I can take the money, never have to run

[Verse 3: Smooth B]
I left my Phillie at home, do you have another?
I wanna get blunted, my brother
Now, may I make a mark then make a spark
Over this phat track – or should I say dope beat?
Subtract, delete
All of the wick wack that wanna be abstract
But they lack the new knack that's coming from way way back
Hey yo, Premier, please pass that buddha sack
You heard we quit? No way, bullshit!
I told you before we come back with more hits
I provide bright flavor, so you can sketch me
Do me a favor, don't try to catch me
Slightly ahead of the game, I'm not a lame
Ask him, he'll tell you the same he knows my name
Smooth, I drop jewels like paraphernalia
I'm infallible, not into failure
Like a rhinoceros, my speed is prosperous
And pure knowledge expands from my esophagus
I write in the night to bring truth to the light
My dialogue is my own, ‘cause Smooth B will never bite

[Outro: scratched Smooth B]
After the tour quits, I come back with more hits x3

What's the matter with your life?
Why you gotta mess with mine?
Don't keep sweating what I do
Cause I'm gonna be just fine - check it out

If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business
Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm giving skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business

Now who do you think you are
Putting your cheap two cents in?
Don't you got nothing to do
Than worry about my friends? Check it...

I can't do nothing, girl, without somebody bugging
I used to think that it was me, but now I see it wasn't
They told me to change, they called me names, and so I popped one
Opinions are like assholes and everybody's got one
I never put my nose where I'm not supposed to
Believe me, if he's something that I want, I'm stepping closer
I'm not one for playing high-pole
Like the high soditty 90210 type of the ho
I treat a man like he treats me
The difference between a hooker and a ho ain't nothing but a fee
So hold your tongue tightly, wish you could be like me
You're popping all that mess only to stress and to spite me
Now you can get with that or you can get with this
But I don't give a shit cause really it's none of your business

1993, S-N-P, packing and macking
Bamboozling and smacking suckers with this track
Throw the beat back in!

If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business
Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm giving skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business

How many rules am I to break before you understand
That your double-standards don't mean shit to me?
I know exactly what you say when I turn and walk away
But that's OK cause I don't let it get it to me
Now every move I make somebody's clocking
Don't ask me nothing, will you just leave me alone?
Never mind who's the guy that I took home...to bone

OK, Miss Thing never giving up skins
If you don't like him or his friends what about that Benz?
Your Pep-Pep's got an ill rep
With all that macaroni trap for rap you better step
Or better yet get your head checked
Cause I refuse to be played like a penny cent trick deck of cards
No, I ain't hard like the bitches on a boulevard
My face ain't scarred, and I don't dance in bars
You can call me a tramp if you want to
But I remember the punk who just humped and dumped you
Or you can front if you have to
But everybody gets horny just like you
So, yo, so, yo, ho - check it, double deck it on a record butt-naked
Pep's ass gets respect, and this butt is none of your business

If I wanna take a guy home with me tonight
It's none of your business
And if she wanna be a freak and sell it on the weekend
It's none of your business
Now you shouldn't even get into who I'm giving skins to
It's none of your business
So don't try to change my mind, I'll tell you one more time
It's none of your business

So the moral of this story is: Who are you to judge?
There's only one true judge, and that's God
So chill, and let my Father do His job

Cause Salt and Pepa's got it swinging again (repeat to fade)

[Hook]
Me and my homies we tighter than a glove
Chop a lot of game is how we do it at the Playaz Club
Check the pool or kick it in the tub
Cause we kick much ass at the Playaz Club

[Verse 1]
I got a ho named Reel-to-Reel
She got a buddy named SP 12, now you know the deal
We gets freaky in the studio late night
That's why the beats that you hear are coming real tight
Something to roll to, something to stroll to
If you's a playa in the game this will hold you
Mo money, mo money for the bank roll
Stick to the script, don't slip in the '94
A lot of fools put salt in the game
To where these women get the notion that they running the game huh
I run my own and I'm my own self person
No respect make the situation worsen
Fillmore, H.P., and Sunnydale
There's a playaz club everywhere you dwell
Lakeview, P.H., and Army Street
A different part of town a different kind of freak
I just wiggle my toes on a mink rug
And press play on the remote at the playaz club

[Hook]

(More champagne, Mr. Forte?)

[Verse 2]
From day one I had to get my money right
Me, Fly, and Franky J we took a airplane flight huh
They wanted to hear a rap I said alright bet
We dropped the beat and grabbed the mic then they wrote a check
A few G's for the pocket no hesitation
Took a flight back to the Golden State and
Shops made orders from a whole new capital
The word was gettin' out 4-Tay's out rappable
Don't need a Glock but I bought one just in case
Suckas try to stop me from pursuing my paper chase
Cause the chase is on because it don't stop
I got the beat and got the rap you make the Glock pop
So treacherous suckas couldn't sweat this on a bad day
By the way just in case you never heard
Rappin 4-Tay, I'm on the smooth tip
Never trippin' off them suckas popping off at the lip
I pop the top off the drank and we can roll some dank bro
Leave the Gat at the house bring some dominoes
Take off your shoes relax and get a body rub
And shoot your macking at these women at the playaz club

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You can't resist it but don't get it twisted
V.I.P. that means the number's not listed
Membership is based on clout and how you carry yourself
Now homie what you all about?
I stack paper and kick it with the O.G's
Some got a nine-to-five some drink a lot of keys
You can learn a whole lot from a playa
A lot of these playas make a damn good rhyme sayer
A lot of people get a misconception
And start drifting in the wrong direction
Miss goody two shoe I' see you later
I ain't got time you ain't nothing but a playa-hater
I'd rather kick it with the crew in Arizona
They chop game like we do in California
Another show another flow a new bank account
But cash money comes in large amounts
So get your membership but never slip to lame fast
Or else Fly will have to tap that ass
And drop you to the ground and make your knees scrub
It's just an everyday thang at the Playaz Club

[Hook]

[Outro: Rappin' 4 Tay & Lil Fly]
Yeah, I'd like to send this shout out
To all the Playaz Clubs throughout the world
I know they got a Playaz Club in Chicago
What about that one they got out there in Philly, Fo?
You know they got one out there in Atlanta
The way they be choppin' it
Shit, Detroit, New York, Texas
Yeah, but we gonna move on down to these Playaz Clubs closer to home like Seattle
L.A., Bakersfield, San Diego
P.A., V-Town, Richmond, Sacramento
Yeah, but a special shot goes out to the Playaz Club
Right across the water in the Biggity Biggity O
Yeah, and last but definitely not least yeah
Them Playaz Clubs they got right there in the
San Francisco mothafuckin' bay, yeah
Where your Playaz Club at 4?

Or like Tribe, go on an Award Tour
Too Slick like Rick, watch Da Youngstas bump

Kurtis Blow made hip-hop hotter
Slide to the rhythm, let your body jerk
Remember all the bass from my man Kool Herc?
Stetsasonic Talking All that Jazz
You know the songs of the past

History that's keeping everything cool

What's going on baby?
Ain't nutting - it's CL Smooth
Sextafied everyday; you gotta know that this live
Let's get right to it

[Hook]
I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

[Verse 1: CL Smooth]
Feel the vibe, when it's bumping in my tribe, steps the Goodfellas
Live on screen now you protect the black queen
Takin my time from the black on black crime
Cause the night Mecca hits, Victoria runs out of secrets
Doing trials in latex Lifestyles Boo; I make you
Call my name, and ask who it belongs to
Brand new, with CL, in Carmel, living well
And never cease to flip the hottest dimepiece
Now the legend increase into a great, truly Mecca made
So in every escapade there's a panty raid
You know the rules, slipping off them ewes; then we can settle
With the woman that can take me to that next level
Lay down the guns and make sons we can teach
From the horseback rides, and the walks on the beach
And if you got pretty feet I won't cheat
I'm into strictly black pearls when I rocket y'all to different worlds

[Hook]

[Verse 2: CL Smooth]
You want a slow wind under my ceiling fan, read books
And beat me at chess, but as for rocking you, who's the best?
It's all good and correct with no disrespect
Skirt chasing hits, taking love to Digable Planets
Be wise and recognize, I'd rather show than tell
Who got the clout to stop faking me all out
Ease your troubles, place your body in the bubbles
Dimepieces fit around the cutie she run with
Embrace the mood, thinking totally nude with no limits
Going through every position within five minutes
Now how we did it got a lot of honies with it
Love is urban now fitted showing nothing but the belly button
Many parlay, and peel off lingerie
So when they come pick the one you could learn from
So feel the beat in Three-Peat like Jordan got wings
Cause I'm doing them things, listen

[Hook]

[Verse 3: CL Smooth]
At last come the goodies, every woman got a love
Hot with all that sex appeal for real, can I hit that?
I'm warmer than your triple-goose with hands like a masseuse
Don't play; cause I'm the hood your mama loves anyway
My heart flips when you take long business trips
I want a divorce, no I think I wanna see your boss
Check you later honey, searchin in your coach bag for money
Before you leave, I hug you til you can't breathe
We Kool and the Gang, and kick slang, baby call in sick
But you kiss me goodbye, and said, ""I don't trick""
She's so thick, and God is my witness
Sometimes you just can't believe that I'm gettin this
Rewind off the Pete Rock design
I want a cutie with a ageless body and timeless mind
The kind that when I wine and dine she pay the bill
Cause it don't cost much to go Dutch baby

[Verse One: Black Thought]
Yo, I'm every MC, it's all in me
That's the way it is, way its gotta be
Indeed as I distort I proceed, indeed
Getting hotter than sacks of boom in my room at the Ramada,
For tanks in your memory banks to fill up
I provide the static, with scratch to match, while you catch the vibe
Most can play high post, but yo that don't mean shit
Because my clique will make a motherfucker sick
I flips, redder than pork, comin to New York to mix
(It's Bob Power) With the snares and kicks to fix
Rhythmatically, you got ta be, static-y
Magiccally I appear, spark a L and drink a beer
With air smooth, takin niggas loot with dice
Then shoot The Roots, poetic, courageously kinetic
Vagabond, versatile and various, plus rap styles
Of mine are blunt, pain is in the mind, so I'm fine and five
Foot seven, inches in height
My mission to strike mics and lighten your tights
Frightening, like lightning
Fluorescent, incandescent, effervescently
I represent, Foreign Objects and Ill Elements
Very relevant, plus intelligently managin matter
That's makin tracks fatter, revolve around
Saturn like rings and brings swings, when I sings with bass
Then distort up in your face like mace
Bustin your dreams like gats with loaded magazines
I'm on the rap scene, repellin fellas like a vaccine
As I, rocks from under blunderin I'm not, lyrically
Ya get, shot, get caught so distort with Thought, for real
It's the illest out the Phi, short for Philidelph-iada-fly
Money makin move fakin I isn't
Niggas can nah front, I'm poetically exquisite
Wicked, with the visit while you're wonderin what is it
Dig it, yo my mellow um whattup for the night
(Malik B, get on the mic, get on the mic)
Like that y'all, and yo I'm flowin, my part of the song
It's goin, it's goin, it's gone

[Verse Two: Malik B]
Now, go get your dictionary and your Pictionary
Cause much affliction with my diction friction slips and carries
Words and herds like some cattle in the steeple
People, there's no equal, or no sequel
So policies, of equalities, get abolished
Demolished, distortion of the static's gettin polished
Urges of splurge and words will just be merged
Together, damn it's quite clever, however
You never, can sound alike, lyrics don't be poundin like
These, troops, who be's, Roots
Insult ya, mellow by culture, rhythmatic vulture
Approach ya, with Magnetic shit that's Ultra
I make MC's dangle like a bangle
Strangle from every angle, my lingo jingles
And it jangles under Kangols
Nahh them niggas don't want to tangle
Cause Roots get loose, negroes get juiced like the mango
To be particular, extra-curricular, for pleasure
Measure, in any weather, value more than the treasure
Baby, you're sayin maybe, then comin to flex
Now you wonder what's next... {*laughter*}

C'mon God niggas is all on your dick

Upstate niggas become chicks, word life

Or how I shot a nigga in the mug
With the slug leavin white chalk all on a pitch black rug
You couldn't tell me other word to mother
When I was 15 runnin around I was the real street lover
On the corner out shootin the dice
Layin up, gettin nice, talkin bout a heist

Push up on a shorty lookin live on the prize
I couldn't get the time of day when I was Little K
Now you call me Buck so your lips wanna puck?
Fuck that bitch, I know your X amount of thoughts
But they call me Buckshot Shorty cause I take no shorts
Word to the shell around my chest
Big up to all de massive rudebwoy pon deck

Knapsack, filled with the shit that I G'd
And a nickel bag of weed, yes indeed
A mad little nigga runnin up on em all
Fly as hell, hit the park play the wall
And all the older people sayin Shorty's a bad-ass
But youse a smart little nigga so you gonna last
They knew the time and they knew the rhyme woulda
Hit you in at least four years, so I came to split ya
In the nine-three it's all about me
Ninety-four ninety-five that's my years fuck it I'm takin over
In nineteen-ninety-eight I couldn't wait

Got the big S on my chest, so I'm kinda gunnin'
High powered on my way to the West Side
To check upon on some chickens
It's a hell of a drive, so drive on
As I hit my dodo stick to the breaking dawn
Crime fighting's what I do and niggas in my crew
Don't take lightly to you bustas and so we say, ""Fuck you""
Then buck you, tuck you in for the night
As you think about the paper at the funeral site
So when I'm hangin' with the clique, and we in demand
I feel good that the city of angels call me black superman

[Hook (x2)]
Now everybody sing
Black superman
Now everybody know
Black superman

*phone rings*
[Hutch's answerphone:] ""Yo this Hutch, I ain't in right now
But uh, leave a message at the beep
You know I'm out flossin' and tossin', dippin' and trippin'
You know what I'm sayin'?""
[KM.G:] ""Aye Hutch man uh, they just leavin' yo mama's house, um, I don't know what they got but, um man, they lookin' for us, man
Call me over at Peach's house.""
*hangs up phone*

[Verse 2: Hutch AKA Cold 187um]
Now it was once said by an ol' loc G
Always tryna come up, yeah, and that's a G
Uh, cause when I bomb it's like a curse
Cause see, once in a lifetime everybody did some dirt
I guess it got to me the same
So at the age of 15, I entered the dope game
I had my game locked up tight
In the day I went to school, but I clocked all night
And when I went to class I always felt asleep
But I was out like a motherfucker, if somebody beeped
My teacher said, ""Boy, can't it wait?""
I said, ""No, I got to put some mo' icing on my cake.""
I think I saved about 50 G's
I bought a truck, a house, and a Coupé on D's
Mom is trippin but she really don't know
All I'm thinkin' is she ain't on the county no mo'
Before my mama fucked with the county again
I'd rather take the risk of doin' 5 to 10
I'm not takin' a chance, I'm straight makin' a chance
So now we deserve to get what we wanna get
I got my mama up outta there
Because y'all motherfuckers just don't care
Uh, you really wanna know why I sold scum
Because my mama to me comes number one
Now you sucker motherfuckers don't understand
But to my mama, I'm her real Black Superman

[Hook: Talkbox (x2)]
Now everybody know
Black superman
Now everybody sing

[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
Y'all mythalogical niggas is comical
The astronomical is coming through like the flu bombing you
And embalming in your crew too
With the musical mystical magical, you know how I do
With word attack skills and vocabulary too
Come to hit you with this edition, it's all brand New
You're through, I'm interplanetarian like Doctor Who who who
So who, who
Born to get tripped on, word is bond
I'm kicking rhymes til the A.M. vultures swarm
Not Quincy, but I'm back on the block and not selling crack
Accompanied with the fat funk flows and tracks
So what you saying black, with all that yackedy yack
My artifacts can't be beat with bats
I'm saying, I eat up everything up on the menu
And bend you and send you swaying, to be continued

[Hook x4]
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is just like that
I get in ya

[Verse 2]
Spur of the moment opponents is suspects
Caught up in precipitation reign of the tech-
Niques, I speak my concepts freak
The ichi ni san shi funk figures of speech
Now that shit is in the open, I'm open, hoking, scoping
Waitin for the next nigga to get opened on
And break him down like a organic compound
That's the weight of the world as the Earth goes round
Now, how the fuck you sound
I represent my clique, like a four-pound
You better pack your levodopa medication for the shaking
Meditation from the earth, that quaking shit that we be making
Never faking I gets down for my crown clown
Shaking the membrane of Encyclopedia Brown
Freaking the funk in any throw down
While you sustained to the sounds, up in you

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I comes down breaking ground
So back up off of me and sit your ass down
Now when I'm on the microphone I roam through zones
But don't be trying this shit at home
No matter what race, creed, color him or her
I comes cleaner than Jeru and Damage an amateur
As chronical facial disorders occur
I'll assassinate your character's caliber
I channel my anger, from the double edged banger
And turn into the microphone strangler
So stop tryna see where your eyes can't follow
Say goodnight to the world and goodbye to tomorrow
You rave and cuss so it's a must you get bust
We're not to be fucked with, Toys Ain't Us
For eternity, through infinity
I eternally, get in you

[Hook]

What you folks want, yeah
We got the funk so come on down
What you folks want, yeah
We got the funk so come on down
What you folks want
We got the funk so come on down

Verse One:

Dres --

Black Sheep, in your house, party people you remember
The two that served your whole crew like the bartender
It's dynamic D, don't you panic cause we won't stop
Until hip-hop, is all it could be, now
You can't checks it when I flex it yo I wreck shhhh
You're turning me off like a naked anorexic
I gets, jazzy baby if you're blastin maybe you can
See me and Mista Lawnge to drop the flavor loops like Toucan

Lawnge --

It's the genuine, nine and then some
Rolling with the Sheep but yo we all can't come
Because the part be on that old strict clientele
Dissing more people at the door than Jessica and Miguel
Now if you're peeps of the Sheep then we'll let you in
But if you didn't buy my album then you're not my friend
I recommend you step back to the end
And watch me catch wreck like fat people breakin wind

Dres --

Black Sheep, we're mighty like Isis
My man, I slam nice, yes more fly than Shazam I am
Dres, D-R-E-S, roar without a floor
I pound clowns who walk on sound for encores
Me and my man sicne eighty-three, makin this fast buck
Act up and get broken when I'm open like a Mack truck
Slammin ya on camera like Gamera it's iller
Cause you never knew the Sheep could catch wreck like Godzilla

Chrous: Dres, Lawnge (repeat 2X)

Yo I can do it [can you do it can you turn the party out]
Ain't nuttin to it [can you make the people wanna scream and shout]
Yeah I can do it [can you do it can you turn the party out]
Yo we can turn this party out [yeahhh, without a doubt]

Verse Two:

Lawnge --

Black Sheep, the definition, by now you should've known
It means wherever we rock the spot gets blown
So when you see is on a flyer, it should be your desire
To witness more wreck than a West coast fire
So be prepared to bounce jump around and all that
You don't have to ask Jack, you know where the party's at
It's uptown in the Boogie Down so don't sleep
On that Non Fiction hit by Black Sheep

Dres --

Be the B-B, L-L-L, L-A-C-K
S-H, double-E-P, and comin your way with A
Dope styles B you can't compare
C-D, come move your ass like you're sittin in my chair
We glow like incense intense like suspense
Commence to rip the party people love nonsense, I
Put the art in party with my padre, word to madre
I love deeper than that lady Sade

Lawnge --

Black Sheep, rips and represents, believe we do
Have more crews than in the days of L.Q
Now let me tell you, what other suckers failed to
We open more doors than a carpenter puts nails through
I wish your style was copywritten, to have fake suckers quittin
Because the Sheep style you're not gettin
Ya see we know, yo, we gotta stay original
Keep the Black Sheep flow and party til it's time to go

Chorus

Outro:

D - Now to the peeps in the back, if you're not the wack, say

Rollin with my muthafuckin' strap on the side of me
(peace to my mothafuckin 9)
Don't fuck with the East Bay Gs

[Verse 1]
Buck 'em down with the clip and the trigga
Screamin' like Eiht, yelling ""Come on nigga""
Nappy-head muthafuckas in a Coupe de Ville
Lightin' shit up like Fire Marshal Bill
You see, I hops on the flow like my nigga Domino
And get a big fat sack of yay-ay
A key or a half, a motherfuckin' thang, pistol-whipped a nigga with an AK-ay
Peep this, loddi-doddi, I shot up his body
I left his ass bloody in the front of the party
It's a yig-a-young nigga rollin' up out the cut
Do a drive-by with the feds on my nuts
Niggas be gettin' gatted when they step to this G
See, I pull my muthafuckin' UZI
And, spill his brain (spill his brain)
Spill his brain (spill his brain)
Spill his brain in his muthafuckin' lap
I pulls a jack (pulls a jack) Pulls a jack (pulls a jack)
And shoot the heart out his muthafuckin' back
I'm comin' with the 187, not with that ho shit
So niggas, spark up the bomb, so we can blow shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Comin' up in a mask like Tales from the Crypt
UZ thang swallows that ass like Lipton, nigga
And now, they're trying to wander and figure
How the fuck Charles Manson turned himself to a nigga
Put a blast on their ass with the holes of the barrel
Bullets fly in a chest like a muthafuckin' sparrow
Cause we get like Steven King, bodies swing from my ceiling
Oak was in the chest when it's time for cap peelin'
9-4, hit the do with a fat gat
Comin' like this, break em down like that
The nigga with the bags and the fat crack sack
Po-Poes on my back, blow their ass off the map
With the 187, mad man killa
Spill a nigga guts for the fuck, cause, I'll be...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It goes one for the treble, you don't wanna floss
Unless you wanna flex with my bitch you Nina Ross
Ga-a-gat that ass with the double-deuce Derringer
From the bay area, the pall-burier
Six niggas carry ya, momma in hysteria
Walk up to your muthafuckin' coffin, and I stare at ya
Cause, you're a dead muthafucka black
And you never should have fucked with the 187 Fac
So nick-nack paddywhack, give a G a gat
And put some bullets in that ass crack
Yeah, break em down with the mac
And like John Madden '93, ""Boom, he's on his back""
Spice 1 is a muthafuckin' troopa
So, say what's up to the East Bay Freddy Krueger
Blow the head off the muthafuckin' cow
When my gat goes off like an M1000
Take the hood off your hooptie when I bust a cap
Rollin with my muthafuckin' strap on my side

In the air, in the air""

Verse One: Lord Jamar, Sadat X

Now let me get a piece of the track, peace to the black
Peeps on the streets with the beats in the jeeps
Comin back in '94 with the raw that's against the law
It's the G-O-D, my delivery is C-O-D
Word is bond and bond is life
We got it goin on tonight, don't nobody wanna fight
They wanna see a tight show where some brothers might go for broke
Utilizing the effects of the smoke

I pull cash to smash to make the blunt last
Fill it with hash til it pass, don't even ask in a flash
Put that ass in the grass, flag is half-mast
Somebody must've passed, we're makin your ass drip into the stands
Fold my cash at last, my task to teach the class
And receive somethin more than brass and some glass
Make a brother work hard, long and fast......

Chorus (x2)

Verse Two: Lord Jamar, Sadat X

Dreadlock, I send a rock from my block
Clock wax like crack, samplin from old stacks
That's where the soul's at, in this whole rap universe
We kick the funky tunes with a burst
Sun, moon and star
Some boom for Jamar
To get me in the flow, now I'm read' to go
Set to show, everybody in the party that we're nice
Wit out sippin on Bacardi and ice

This style flash, Jamar'll be the shining star
No matter who you are, no matter who you are
I'll rape the tape, drive along in interstate
Wit weight, wipe the slate and, mob the gate
And by fakin I'll avoid the court date, no legal aid
Everything's paid, why cause a tyraid
If the money ain't made, talkin millions
But spendin penny's and gettin cheap shoes from Kenny's

Chorus

Verse Three: Lord Jamar, Sadat X

Now let's take time out to say peace to the GODs (PEACE)
Bust how I release cause this beat is hard
We be the squad from raw-taught to rule
Take a thought to the top now I drop the jewel

I push the Cadillac DeVille and still we real
I drive a garbage truck and not give a ........
I need to earn a buck four-a-year
I'm thru with buyin wild gear
Just somethin I can wear, somethin fly when I'm there

Well now we're here to take the gold and the cash for the bill fold
I told their ass to chill and they're still cold
Frozen cause they're not amongst the chosen one
Sun shines like a beacon, similar to how I'm speaking

As I receive the mic for the last time, I clear up your past crime
All felonies can go, as long as you know
Brand Nubian will stand, without the use of a band
We always work with a plan

Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
(Tic toc, you don't stop...)

[Verse 1: Doitall]
Tic toc, this is how we rock
We're those same (um) brothers that brought you ""Chief Rocka""
Now, um, underground's my style
To this I have vows
And I swear to my god
I'll always rock a crowd
So (um) peace to my area, N.W.K
Which is scarier
So if your on the deals
Who cares, the more the merrier
Now right off South Orange
On the block of one-nine
Of course, thirteenth ave
Is my stomping grounds
I open up my chest
And to my 'hood give my heart
Cause without the heart
Then your 'hood falls apart
So respect to the cement
The park called ""the Corner""
Cause that's where the DoItAll two was performing
Runnin' from the cops
I couldn't be stopped
Cause I was jumpin' big gates that connected the blocks
Now before making records
The 'hood was my savior
But now I'm making tunes to make you jam wit 'cha neighbor...

[Hook]
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)

Throw your hands in the air and represent your block (um)

Well, I be the funk-ular
Ultra-funk-ular
Gamma-funk-ular
Half you rappers out there couldn't see me with binoculars
Anyone who thinks he'll take me out is just a dreamer
If you think you're the bomb, then I'm Hiroshima
When I die
I hope they're making records up in heaven
On a scale of one to ten
I'm like 100-5th-11
And sticks-and-stones-may-break-my-bones
But if you ever try to diss the Lords, then it's on
I go on beat...
Off beat...
Then jump right back on time
I drop another rhyme
And talk about your fat ugly mama (EEWWW!!)
M.C.'s cannot rock me
I'm stone-proof
Me grabbin' the mic
Is like Superman running to a phone booth
Straight from Martin Luther King Boulevard
In the heart of Newark, New Jersey
Make you say ""Lord have mercy""
If you step up in my face
Then it's do or die
And I'm Gonna Make You Cry! (waaahhhhh!!)

[Hook]
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and represent your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
(Tic toc, you don't stop...)

[Verse 3: DoItAll]
Well, times have changed
Not only for the urban
But also for suburban
We get props, we're deservin'
From black kids, to white kids
I see them bob their heads
From the blond hair, to redhead
I even seen a dread
So now it doesn't matter
As the clock winds down
With the tic and the toc
Because they love the sound
But people 'round your area
Say you sell out
Because you sell a million copies
And your tone goes BAAAAOOWW!
So do it for yourself
And do it for the 'hood
But do it from the heart
Cause that's when it's good
Now tell me what's gonna happen
After the rappin'
When the clock ticks away
And ain't nothin' happenin'...

[Verse 4: Mr. Funke]
..I remember way back in the days on my block
When the kids used to meet up in the hallway and rock
On Martin Luther King's boulevard
With P.C., wise, Easy Ed, and my brother hard Bernard
Used to hit the ill rhymes from the head
While I'd hit the beat on the wall until my hands turned red
You had the Shorty two MC's
The Educated Three
I have to give them props for helping me be me
Now I'm the one who's educated
I suffered but I made it
I only write rhymes that will be appreciated
No matter how large I get
The fire still burns
Cause from the 'hood I came
And to the 'hood I must return...

[Hook]
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop (um)
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and represent your block (um)

Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I

[Verse 1: Cee-Lo]
I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asking ""gimme some"", living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit, and I'm probably gon do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you I...
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know something I don't
Do you have any suggestions?
Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route without any doubt
Or fear, I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you dickhead
See when I was a youngster, used to wear them fucking Pro Keds
My mama made me do it, but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense I was Rosemary's baby
And then, I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money, so I never whipped 'em
See all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit bitch
You need to git up, git out, git something
Smoke out, cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized, cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool
Yeah, it's real cool, getting paid fat pockets
And all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm digging through the ash tray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Se-dan DeVille, steady bouncing
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog
Dipping from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead
Cause I have no time for jail; fuck Clampett cops; fuck Eldrin Bell
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo, OutKast, a vision from the past
Hootie Hoo, my White Owls are burning kind of slow

Y'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh. Why?
Ain't nobody black running but crack-kers, so, why I got to register?
I thinking of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take ya way, back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ay
Y'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13, start working at the loading dock
They laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping
But I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping
Doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point, still actin a fool
Wasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not, thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up. I should've listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang, so I payed her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke and shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-UT-KAST
So get up off your ass

I'll fuckin, cut your eyelids off
And feed you nuthin but sleepin pills

Album: Things in Tha Hood
Song: Dig a Bigga Ditch

Eh yo! creep with the t double-e from flint
This crazy mother fucker that's always been
Fuckin' up as i bust shots and lots of clips
And, breakin' these niggas down fo' they shit
See, i give a fuck about a bitch, switch

Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch

Which, won't take too much time
So this stupid mother fucker can't drop the dime
I'm, back to the street
(with what nigga)
With gangster shit and dope beats
T double-e's fin to get my cash on
So i get my blast on
Grab my clip and dash home
So it's on in the city where i slide
Forget about the troubles and get nine to five and get high
Chillin' with the dfc
And i got nineteen niggas behind me
Ready to get busy
Who is he
I'm making it plain
So you stupid mother fuckers won't forget my name
It's like, murder, murder, and movin' up on my hits
And always keep a nine up on my side and fuck that bullshit

Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)
Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)
Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)
Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch

Peep, I'm representin' to you, snipin'
My nigga tee don't give no fuck about a fight
It's the one, two, three, ghetto life sound
Boom, boom, boom, they all fall down

Now here's a little story about a nigga on the run
Never leaves the pound without packing a gun
Paranoid, unemployed, but making bank
Strapped, standing up on the corner slangin' dank

It's the dfc, in the c-i-t, y
F-l-i-n-t, i
Take these niggas on the warpath
Poppin' em, stoppin' em, drop em in the bloodbath

Niggas got to clown
So, every since i got back i've been puttin' it down
And straight fuckin' up shit
And it don't quit
Now I'm the mother fucker tellin' you to get to dig beyyatch!!
This is fo the husler's yo
Capone with the light skin, tone with the flow
Here we go, check one, two with this
Dick in yo mouth as we do it like this beyyatch!

Straight bumpin' in the '68 chevrolet impala
Bitches wanna follow, swallow
Deez mother fucking nuts!!!

Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)
Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch
Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)
Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)

Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)

I'm starin' at the corner in my room at night
I picks up the pen so i make my shit tight
And i write, daily to keep my rhymes dope
And big man's think that can hang when i quote
Choke ho's as i cough those with lots of dick
To, let 'em know I'm down fo my shit
Yo ho, ass i might blast
But first i want yo cash
Then yo bitch, no switch
What it is, twitch
No i don't want yo bitch
Cuz bitches ain't shit
But mother fucking ho's and tricks
Roll where the streets meet at
Where hood meets hood, with bat 'n strap
Ready to peel a cap and rat tat tat tat goes the nine
In the c-i-t-y where i slide
I break a mother fucker when i gots to
With my Glock too
Many niggas ball and make it hot
To stop, and grab your cock and pop
And do the wok
We cop thirty six and slang dope on our block
And keep a down bitch in yo corner
And if you disrespect then fuck nigga you's a gonna

Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)
Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch
Nigga figgaz he's bigga, dig a bigga ditch (bitch)

[Verse 1]
What up, kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you should have slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for looking back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talking 'bout he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
(One what?) One love!

[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 2]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is going on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together. What up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwilding in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home he'll play it low-key
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love

[Hook: Q-Tip]
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world
Thinking: ""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects, I take my pen and pad
For the weekend, hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed something terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rolling two phillies together, in the Bridge we call 'em oo-wops
He said: ""Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce.""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chilling on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
‘Cause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Could've caught your man
But didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12 tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'm ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love

[Intro: Scarface + (friend)]
(So what you gonna do when you get outta here cat daddy?)
I don't know dawg. I'm just trying to live it one day at a time, ya know?
(I hear you talkin' man, live it one day at a time...)
(It ain't nothing but a thang though, bro)
Yeah I hear you fool...
Well let me get up outta here, my ride out here waitin' for me
(Alright cat daddy, take it easy baby)
You stay up fool
(Peace)

[Verse 1: Scarface]
He greets his father with his hands out
Rehabilitated slightly, I'm glad to be the man's child
The world is different since he's seen it last
Out of jail, been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last
All he had was his mother's letters
Now he's molded and he's gotta make a change and make it for the better
But he's black so he's got one strike against him
And he's young plus he came up in the system
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen
And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean
So he's calling up his homie who done came up
Livin' large, now they dealin' with the same stuff
And had that attitude that who he was worth it
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man
Now it's different, he who did dirt
And realized killin' men, meant comin' up but it still hurt
And can't nobody change this
It's nineteen-ninety-four and we up against the same shit
I never understood why
I could never see a man cry, til I seen a man die

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Imagine life at it's full peak
Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy
Imagine peace on this Earth when there's no grief
Imagine grief on this Earth when there's no peace
Everybody's got a different way of endin' it
And when your number comes for service then they send it in
Now your time has arrived for your final test
I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath
How much longer will it be til it's all done?
Total darkness and ease be at all one
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate
You took his life, but your memory you'll never take
You'll be headed to another place
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face
I still gotta wonder why
I never seen a man cry til I seen a man die

[Verse 3: Scarface]
I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong
But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on
And you keep on blacking out and your pulse is low
Stop trying to fight the reaper just relax and let it go
Because there's no way you can fight it though you'll still try
And you can try it til you fight it but you'll still die
Your spirits leave your body and your mind clears
The rigormortis starts to set, now you outta here
You start your journey into outer space
You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place
So you standing in the tunnel of eternal life
And you see the ones you never learn to love in life
Make the choice, let it go if you can back it up
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up
But if you ready close your eyes and we can set it free
There lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace
I still got to wonder why
I never seen a man cry til I seen that man die

Where the knotty-headed niggas and the Brick City brigade dwell
And if you don't know your fool better ask

And yo E, we comin to you live with the Cosmic type stuff

[Verse One : Redman]

Well it's that brother coming six billion feet from beneath

Elements, and it's coming through your block

HUHHHHHHH! Got a little Redman in town

Wild out on his staff like birds one and two

You get hurt up, word up, Jam-med like Pearl
Knock off from blood clot puff on the rough block
R.I.P. my man, Rockafella, it don't stop

[Verse Two :]

Newark, New Jersey, rock rock on, word is bond
I'm comin in swarms, so turn your flashlights on
Due to difficulty, my style flows while it travels across the planet
In 48 Hours like Nick Nolte
Droppin the flavor, stay Sky high like Pager
I'm magical like Fantasia on paper
I Saw the Light like Kraftwerk, of course
When the T-L-A Rock shock the stuff, It's Yours!
To your drawers, your record label got your staff gassed
Thinkin you gonna sell two mil cakes real fast
But you flopped, and your image choked like a tec
Now, who freakin style your ass gonna steal next?
Are there any more imitators in the house?? There are no
Bust like NBA Jams, and you can have Chicago
Catch the cargo, funky like a bag of Bravos
Way back, when I used to pump 92 KTU and Carlos
Huuhhh! I just stay funky like that
Make you wanna (sssss) my style like a junkie on crack
Trick, you better back the freak up, for real now
When I break it down from Newark NJ to IllTown

[Chorus :]
On and on, and it don't quit
Redman rockin on to the funky shit, c'mon
On and on, and it don't quit
Redman rockin on to the funky shit

I said Cali's in the house Cali's in the house
I said Atlanta's in the house Atlanta's in the house
North Carolina's in the house Carolina's in the house

[Verse Three :]

Yoo-hoo watch the birdie!! While Red wreck your brains early
If rap was B-Ball, I'd have assists like James Worthy
Dribble the rock if you got the hots to get your knot rocked
Twice my device, Run-D.MC's from my Rock Box
Hey you, better Come Clean like Jeru
Before I take phase two and do another pay-per-view
To your crew, I give a boom bip to Q-tip
Standin tall like Shaq, honey I'm back, this ain't Blue Chips
The new stuff, creamin brothas like Breyers
He's heating up -- nah, brotha, I'm on fire!
Dribble dribble shootin three pointers to the drum trick
Try to take my style? BLAOW! and one
DJ Twinz in the house for the nine-square
My man Shaft, you don't know you better ask

[Outro :]

696,6592,Shaquille O'Neal,Biological Didn't Bother,18,1994-11-19,"

Yo, Yo
I want to dedicate this song to Philip Arthur Harrison
Word up
Cause he was the one who took me from a boy to a man
So as far as I'm concerned, he is my father cause my biological didn't bother

[Verse 1]
Biological father, left me in the cold, when a few months old
Aa father's child was greater than gold but I guess not
You brought me into the world but you're not my dad
Mess around with those drugs makes my moms mad
So we left you with no remorsal pity
Took the first bus from Newark to Jersey City
Woman and child alone, now that's pressure
Moms got to go to work, drop me off by Obesa
Momma, Aunt DeDe, whoever
Aunt Falma, Uncle Roy we stuck together
A year went by and I could walk y'all
Moms got that good ol job at city hall
She probably didn't trust men anymore
Until Philip Harrison walk though the door
Went out a few times but what about Shaquille
Moms offered him a million dollar package deal
She said you want me you gotta take my son
Or else its like a hot dog but without the bun
Guess what he accepted, responsibility he never left it
He kept it, he kept it
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

[Hook]
Took me from a boy to a man
So I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother (4x)

[Verse 2]
January 5th Phil made a promise (what's that)
He joined the army we moved to fort Monmouth
He disciplined me right from the get go
Age 2 bottle and my Mom shaquille let go
Actin spoiled, rotten, trippin
Got a butt whippin because I didn't listen
Back then you see privates made no bucks
Had to get another job driven trucks
Workin hard as hell didn't satisfy him
Had to another job working at the gym
He wasn't ""Gone with the Wind"" like Clark Gable
Work all them jobs to put food on the table
Phil's my father, daddy and thats the scoop
Can I go to the gym with you and shoot some hoops
Come on he put me under his wing
Was the ball boy for his little Arthur team
Sometimes he even made me mad
But it didn't matter cause I still wanted to be like dad
But a little bit better
Encouraged me to stay in school and to get then good letters
I wasn't a brainiac but I tried hard
Got to watch the Knicks play if I had a good report card
All types, all sorts
Disobeyed my dad and I couldn't play sports
I learned to dribble from right to left
I couldn't do a damn thang with all them F's
Age 15 father and son confrontation that's nothin
But father and son trials and tribulation
Back then I could under stand but I'm glad you did it
Cause now I'm a man
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

(chorus)

[Verse 3]
Look at me now successful for sure
Phil raised me well, to be an entrepreneur
And if you're making big dope be materialistic
Cause you'll end up another statistic
Everything's going well following my dreams
I dunked on Patrick Ewing
I want the ring like Hakeem
Uh oh what do you know
Biological ones on the Ricky Lake show
What does he want, does he want money
What people do for money!!!
It's kinda funny to me
He ain't gettin no check from me (check it)
He can go on all the talk shows he want
Phil is my dad so dont even front
He took me from a boy to a man so Phil is my father
Cause my biological didn't bother

(Chorus)

Ah two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said the rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was def and then it went this way
Apple to a cherry to a cherry to a plum
Don't stop rockin 'til I get some
It's up my back around my beck
WOO-HAH!  I got the girl in check
It's up my back around my spine
Dr. Dre c'mon, your turn to rhyme!

[Dr. Dre]
C'mon everybody let's all get down
What we got it's a brand new sound
So nobody out there be misled
My name is Dr. Dre (and my name is Ed!)
Look in the skies!  Look in the trees!
Who do you see?  (D-R-E!)
Look in the skies!  Look in the trees!
Who do you see?  (D-R-E!)
I'm not a preacher or a teacher or electrician
Biter or fighter or a politician
Some people say, I'm a turntable magician
And I got the key, to your ignition
Young ladies, rock the house
That's young ladies, shock the house
And just throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you got on clean, underwear
Somebody say, ""Ohh yeah!""
""Ohh yeah!""  All the ladies
All the ladies in the house say, ""Owww!""
""Owww!""  And you don't stop
So c'mon Ed Lover let's rock the spot

[Chorus: Dr. Dre & Ed Lover]
When I wake up in the morning and I drink my coffee
Like my buttered roll buttered softly
Like my apartment it's nice and lofty
All you little suckers you can back up off me!
Back up off me, back up off me
All you little suckers you can back up off me!
Back up off me, back up off me
B-A-C-K U-P off me!

One two three fo' five six seven
Rockin like hell make it sound like heaven
Seven six five fo' three two one

Don't you get me on that jive
About the things you wrote before I was alive
Cause this ain't nineteen-eighty-three
And my name is the T-Money!
With the bomb-diddy-bomb-a-dang-a-dang-dang
That's the new T-Money type of swang

[Ed and T-Money]
C'mon, let's go to work!
C'mon, let's go bezerk!
Cause we don't wanna be left behind
All we wanna do is just blow yo' mind
We like yo' girl she's really fine
(Plus she has a +BIG+ behind!!)
Let's do it, let's do it
Let's do it do it do it

[T-Money]
Criminal Minded, you've been blinded
Lookin for a style like mine, you can't find it
(YES!!) The rhythm, the rebel
Without a pause, I'm lowerin my levels
To find a ugly woman to have sex

My name is Ed Lover not Kurtis Blow

And I'll rock the house, with a funky rhyme
Don't - push - me, cause - my - middle - name - is - Eddddd
I'll - get - up, and - smack - you - in - your - headddd
I said a hip, hop, the hip hip the hop
The hop the hop hibby dibby hip hip hop
It's me and Dr. Dre and we're on the top
And we got the rhymes that just won't stop
One, two, three
Hey you can smoke a spliff with a clip but you're still not
HIGHHHHH enough, or wide enough to touch
ME!  Cause I'm the Big E-D
And I'm rockin the house, in the place to be

Yes indeed we blowin' up with speed
Come to lift the part up with the rhymes we weave
All woven shorty styles not jokin'
Not a buffalo Bill so u know there ain't no chokin'
Wicked on a stage like a bengal in a cage
Don't try ta approach as I turn the page
It's the next rhyme this is Quo time
Curious about the flav that was left in your mind
Behold 20 million records gonna be sold
Before we're even old enough to drive
So get live as we bust up da stage
Clockin' a grip, kickin' a flip, bustin' a tic
While I'm stealin your honey dip
With quick reaction like Action Jackson
And this is just a profile of the rhyme tread traction
So back the hell up (What?)

[Chorus:]
We Blowin' Up
We come to drop da bomb
We Blowin' Up
We come to drop da bomb
We Blowin' Up
We come to drop da bomb
We Blowin' Up
We come to drop it

Not just to drop da bomb I came to let ya know
That we flow, Like ice cream drippin down your elbow
Hard but smoov and wet
Will Quo rip the set bet
But yo back to the topic at hand
Understand, a young man
With soul drippin out da pores
Openin' up doors, sellin out tours
Ready to make top core bills with thrills
Like honeys with chills
And shakes and shivers all over when I rush it
I'm smoother than dooky down the toilet when ya flush it
So back up get a grip
Ya can't come equipped enough to rush the stuff I let go
With the ability to knock ya out wuicker than Riddick Bowe
Want a piece of this young gun finishin' up the 2nd verse
So don't interrupt, we blowin' up

[Chorus]
[Break]

A state of mind that ya very seldom enter
Beginnin' this time with a dope style inventor
Who's that? That's me, my bad
I'm teachin class so grab your pen and your pad
The science I'm droppin is gettin hectic
Bringin you more energy than General Electric
So drop da bomb, wake the calm
Try to follow the funky flow from night to dawn
Cuz most can't hang with my slicked up style
A rhythmatically god-gifted child
So just watch the two get funky
I'm slammin' harder than Harold Minor when he'z dunkin'

In the slammer kid but I'm innocent
Lord played witty wasn't having any pity
Now in Razor Blade City
Cries oppose the situation seen mad eyes of foes
Drives a Rolls, hey, yo, money, what size are those?
Need to phone, ""Me too"" another sprang up, hmm, to gang up
On this kid, housing the phone like he didn't know how to hang up
Would be hard to opt a minute or so and then yells time on a
And when you get your commissary, buy this and that or else I'm gonna
Be on that ass and won't stay off, extort, fig I say, way off
Beaten to death, you ain't protecting me, forgot today's my day off
Hold my head and drift the Sumo weight in knots and cars
Instead of sitting here accumulating cuts and scars, behind bars

Behind bars

[Slick Rick]
Showing off cuz on the phone, click, losing all the hoes off
Niggas housed the watch and Donna took all of the clothes off
Nigga hell with drawers that's what my clothes figured telling
Every night it seem like mice be in and out a nigga cell and
Still ain't home, like on the hook, seen a bunch of kids look
Miss outdoors, never know what you have until it's tooken
And in fact, the moment you fear, all of that, you quote snaps
Well in a cell, did the exercises and wrote raps
I be a bigger star than you, no never heard of the nigga
Takes my raps and read aloud, I wanted to murder the nigga
Just kidding, no offend to it, finally he ended it
Case dismissed, but your honor, DA kindly prevented it
He told to the judge, don't free him, this brother trigger wars
And not just that because I refuse to wash some jive nigga drawers
So hold the head, drift the Sumo weight in knots and cars
Instead of sitting here accumulating cuts and scars

What fight? the nigga trip, C.O. the rest he might scared
By couldn't squeal, I's like officer that nigga right there
Now if he ain't get me his friends will, needed a utensil
It turned out, I had to stab him in the eye wit a pencil
State of shock, he made a yell, I said, now what you want traitor
C.O. puts me in the bin, I see ya about a month later
Back in population, didn't matter that his friends tensed
The phone prints, the years added to the sentence
Still chilling and all of that and I escape
When I don't think so, don't hit the stove cause they made a rape attempt
Thank goodness, failed, call out next, he wail out
Here go the C.O., ""Ricky Walters, pack up, you're bailed out""
The C.O. couldn't see the rape, the kid'll snitch mass figure
Fast trigger, you'll be back, you little bitch ass nigga
Au revoir, back to dating sluts and stars
At least for now, no more accumulating cuts and scars

Chorus [2x]:
{Here kitty-kitty, here kitty-kitty-kittyyyyy!}
Aw, kitty kitty!
{Here kitty-kitty, here kitty-kitty-kittyyyyy!}
I thought I saw a puddy tat!

Bridge A [2x]:
(What you doin'?) {Nuttin', hon!  Uhh, uhh, I'm just nuttin', hon!}
(What you doin'?) {Nuttin', hon!  Aww, honey-hon!}

Like I said, the party ain't dead
These girls ain't even scared to give head!
Verse 1:
Girl, stop tryin' to be smooth
Make way for a brother to make the first move
You're tryin' to act nice and sweet
'Cause I know that you is a freak
So let a brother lick them paws
And run the tongue on the g-string draws
And tease the kitty just a little
Then stick my pole in the middle
Before I hit, let me ask
Did the dogs done hit in the path
'Cause if they ain't got they shots
Then the kitty might not get got
They say it ain't got a bad bone
In any ol 'eyes, it's gold
So girl, don't act seditty
Just give a brother some of that kitty!

Chorus, Bridge A

Like I said, the party ain't dead
All these chicken heads just scared!
Verse 2:
Kitties is cool and all that
But I like the real big cats
See, a cat got a little more strength
So they can take a little more length
You gotta feed a kitty real slow
But a cat can take a little bit mo'
So lay on down on the silk
So you can get a bowl of this milk
Then let's do it like dogs
I wanna see ya climb the walls
And once I get in them guts
I'ma do that straight cat strut
So please don't make a brother beg
To get inbetween them legs
Come on girl, have some pity
And give a brother some of that kitty!

True dat, true dat!  True dat, true dat!

[Intro: Gil Scott-Heron]
The blues has always been totally American
As American as apple pie
As American as the blues
As American as apple pie
The question is why
Why should the blues be so at home here?
Well, America provided the atmosphere

[Verse 1]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
I take a look over my shoulder, as I get older
Getting tired of mothafuckas saying, ""Warren I told ya""
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
With these funny-bunny niggas, ain't shit changing
Got my Mama wondering if I'm gang banging
But I don't pay attention to these father figures
I just handle mine, and I'm rolling with my niggas
Off to the VIP, you see Snoop Dogg and Warren G
Unbelievable how time just flies
Right before your eyes, but you don't recognize
Now who's the real victim, can you answer that
The nigga that's jacking or the fool getting jacked?

[Refrain]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

[Verse 2]
Another sunny day, another bright blue sky
Another day, another muthafucka die
These are the things I went through when I was growing up
There's only one hood, and niggas shit be throwing up
And I knew it, there really ain't nothing to it
Thinking every fool's gotta go through it
Now let's go back, how far, back in time
Dragging to these hookas trying to mack for mine
I remember when we all used to stop at the spot
Back then my nigga-name was Snoop Rock
It was all so clear, '87, '88, then '89s the year
You say everywhere we roll, you can say we roll thick
Way back then 2-1-3 was the clique
Something to stay paid I was just a young hog
Warren G, Snoop Rock and Nate Dogg

[Refrain]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years

[Verse 3]
You make me wanna holla, get out the game
Too many muthafuckas know my name
While Snoop Dogg's serving time up in Wayside
I puts it down on the street, don't try to take mine
I had to reassure the homie that he wasn't alone
We'd talk, and him and Nate'd conversate on the phone
He kept saying, ""Nigga, it won't be long
Before a little skinny nigga like me'll be home""
I said ""Snoop, things done changed, it's not the same
We need to get up out the game
Cause we can get paid in a different way
With you kicking dope rhymes and I DJ""
Well as time goes past, slowly we try to make it
But things are getting hectic, I just can't take it
Should I, A: Go back to slanging dope
Or should I, B: Maintain and try to cope
Or should I, C: Just get crazy and wild
But no, I chose D: Create the G-Child
It's been on ever since with me and Mista Grimm
This shit is getting so hectic that I can't even trust him now
What would you do for a Warren G cut
Would you act the fool and nut the fuck up
Back the fuck up, act the fuck up
Niggas talk shit they get smacked the fuck up, straight up

[Refrain]
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G
You don't hear what I hear
But it's so hard to live through these years
You don't see what I see, every day as Warren G

[Intro]
Mack playas, ballas, grindas
Yeah I'm the real true pimp of the year
Will ya feel me
Ha ha, pimp of the mutha' fuckin' year

[Verse 1]
Give it up give it up a give it to me
A big mack capitalized Double D, see
And it's on, so I'ma get sick with it
A give me drank and bomb and let me get with it
Yeeyah, cause I'm gonna be the biggest pimp of the year
Goin' around doin' shit like this here
Cause a nigga is strong
And way too long when it comes to my ding dong
But, bet, I get a check when I sign on the dotted line
So now I know I gotta get mine
It's really no thang to me
See, to be a real true P.I.M.P
Cause I had me a ho or two or mo'
Way back in 80 fuckin' 4
That's when I was a teen
But my dick was still big to make a bitch bleed, see
And of coarse I'm slappin' hoes
Smackin' hoes, up and down the fuckin' avenues
And ever I do that
I dig a deep in the pocket for the fat gat
Feel me. I'm so goddamn bad
That I had to kick off in a ho's ass
Cause the girl tried to do me
Ride of with her man in the mustang pony
And I know it'd catch up with her
Next day in the paper, yeah, the nigga raped her
But I'm not trippin'
Bitches like you wanna keep on slippin'
So I had to move on
To the next young bitch that had it goin' on
Ugh, and I'm not here to pump no fear
I'm just the mack playa' pimp of the year, bitch

[Hook]
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies
Pimp, pimp on... You got all the ladies

[Verse 2]
First thang first on the second verse
I learned a hell of a lot
A get from the get down start
So I had my hoes hoin'
Had every tramp thinkin' I was the orthidano goin'
Cause all the game I spit is good shit
And the shit that I spit made me rich
Cause I was all about money
If the girl says she down, well bees come and get the honey
Cause I'm givin' it up quick
Take a hit, take a lick at them pink lips
Uh, and a bet is better than grey
Not knowin' that I bought this broad out of state
And I met her in Mentley
Lookin' just like the actress singer Whitney
But I knew she was a fake one
But to me young bra' it didn't really make me none
I just walked up to her
I said my name's Dru Down and I'll Slick Rick the ruler
And from the get go
I'm just a pimp, ho, ya comin' with me, a to the east side O
And then she said, ""Okay
I'm on my way, let me pack my bags before today""
Yeeyah, then I said, ""Get with it
And don't be a bitch and try to split""
Uh, She was right up under my wing
At the airport at 5:15
She said ""Who are you and why are ya here?""
I said I'm Dru Down and pimp of the year

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I've got a thang for makin' hoes
Every woman that I touch bitch turns into gold
And I don't go for talk back
Have respect when ya speakin' to a pimp fuck that
Deduct from the paycheck
Matter of fact get yo ass in the back of the Cadillac
So I can ride and checkmate
Like rule number eight I keep a bitch in a plate
And no I don't play around, fuck around
A when it comes to my money, nigga
And when it comes to gettin' a bitch sprung
I give her Hennessy, a with the one on one
So she can get so high, real high
And that she that knows I'm that type a guy
Cause I'm a kick something just for the hoes
And for myself I keep indo'
And when a ho finds out I'm real, yes I am
Mack playa pimp of the year

Dana Dane
Never gonna let you fade away, away
Dana Dane
Never gonna let you fade away, away
Dana...

[ INTRO ]
Full-circle, 360 degrees Dane
My style will live forever, my fame will be maintained
Now some can't feel this, and some feel can't that
But all can feel a track that's produced by Battlecat
So gather round and listen to my non-fiction
The picture will come clearer than a Sony television
This ain't about dissin, this is all fact
Women on my nuts cause my vocals makin cash

[ Hook ]
(The Rapper Dana Dane, what time is it?)
She's on the record's jock, she doesn't love me
(The Great Dana Dane, what time is it?)
She's just stressin my fame and my money

[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm bustin this one for Bridget, the ho
I met at the Emmaco pumpin the petrol into her five point o
I wanted her because she looked like Janet Jackson
Caramel complexion, sportin sexy fashion
""Hello, how you're doin?"" I said, ""they call me Dane""
""I could learn to love your flavor, hon, hey, what's your name?""
She had nothin for me, totally ignored me
High-sided, took it like she never saw me - cool
So I tried again: ""What up! How you're feelin?""
Was a hot and humid day, but I felt a cold chill
I figured, let me step before I have to diss her
That's when I overheard her girlfriend try to whisper
(Oh, I know him from somehwere - oh, that's Dana Dane!
I saw him last week, he performed on _Soul Train_)
Now honey flipped the script like Sybill
""You're not the Rapper Dana Dane with fame, is you?
Ooh, I like your records, ooh, you're the man
Ooh, you're so fine, I'm your number one fan""
Now she knows that I'm the Dane, all of a sudden I'm accepted
Ridin on my nuts cause I'm pumpin out hit records

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 2 ]
Next I peeped this honey at the bar scopin the Dane hard
Loud, money proud, yo, I knew her ho card
Native New Yorker, Brooklyn fast-talker
Big jewelry-sporter, sippin Johnny Walker
She bought me this drink, she's flashin her cash
She passin me hints like she wanna give me the ass
I avoided her because I knew her man Pedro
She said (Dana, fuck him, let's talk about your stage show!)
You ??? well, there ain't no brother brother
Hands on my pants, woulda yoked it if I let her
She was gettin tippsy, dancin like a gypsy
Seen her before, but never knew she was this frisky
Tried to break lips, but she wasn't tryin to have it
Playin me close like ??? metal to a magnet
Then she shouted: ""Dane, I can't wait to get you naked!""
Ridin on my nuts cause I'm pumpin out hit records

[ Hook ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now last but not least, let me tell you 'bout Judy
Baaya with the tattas, booya with the booty
A cutie with a juicy fat coochie
Felt it was my duty to make her sing like Suzy
??? 'Cha-ya-ya-ya...' - recall the flavor?
From the first album that the Dane ever gave ya
Anyway, no more delay, she was a hard nut to crack
Kicked the rap like a mack, but she wouldn't give me jack
But still she's in my grill every time that she sees me
Askin (When you're comin with that new fat release?)
Well, I seen her 'bout a weak about, I told her 'bout a week or so
""Wouldn't you like to be in Dana Dane's video?""
Now she started clickin, dissed her in addition
Comin to my crib for the private audition
Again the same game, just a different scenario
Ridin on my nuts to play a part in my video
Must be the music
That's makin her flip
Must be the music
Must be the music

[Verse 1]
I gets banned if I do gets banned if I don't
So sometimes I will and sometimes I won't
Puff mad stick crack a forty down the back
Sit fat and relax and plan my attack
Not the one to test I posess mad finesse
My buddha was blessed one bird in the nest
Chills with my peeps steady bouncing in jeeps
On the New York streets hittin urban concrete
I'm the man untestable, with the extraterrestrial flow
Four Fifty Six Cee-Lo, pop the top off the forty ounce bottle
I'm not the one to follow, I'm not the role model
Hollow tips in my clips money grip and my Glock
Only spits when I react to the bullshit
So give me room to breathe and get up off DEEZ
And save the confessions for JEESuz
Plus I don't need to hear no sorrow
Eff it, the sun will still come out tomorrow
Long as I'm breathing, needing, even like Steven
Achieving, gettin some cheese and
Representin lovely, Boogie Down Bronx major
With the project flavor, I made ya, daze ya
My behavior is mad ill if you front
You know what I want!

(Whutcha want Nine?) Fat beats for my rhymes
(So whutcha want Nine?) Mad clips for my nines
(So whutcha want Nine?) A ill posse
And my name up in lights, N-I-N-E

[Verse 2]
I'mma let you know how I feel on the real
I pack steel
It's like a jungle, makes me wonder
Where my heel hits the bricks
Skips the dog shit, completin' my cipher
Temper like Rowdy Roddy Piper, hyper like a viper
I'mma strike if I gotta
Goin' for the jugular
Stretch you like a copper
Stoppah, stoppah, but you can't stop me
Just clock me, just watch me blow up the spot G
Came a long way from, back in the day
We did it for no pay, just rhymin' hit the hay and
Sleep, wake up, write another rhyme
Hit the park after dark, drop the beat one time
That's when shit was real, no phonies no bologna
Just a homie, mics and wheels of steel
Backup from the roof, amp plugged in the street light
Everything right, jam over: street fight
Back to the lab I grab my pen and pad
Raw lyrics make a sore and a scab
Had no dinero, enough get fo' chicken wings and rice
A forty ounce a nickel bag to get nice
And now I might make a million, and still son
It makes the heart pump, you know what I want

[Hook]

[Verse Three:]
Be like Elmer J. Fudd with the mansion and the yacht
Brand new Clock non-stop hip-hop
Remote control boombox lampin' on my dresser
The God ain't no lesser as the pressure comes to test ya
Hundred pound weight around the neck, daily
Nuff treasons, nuff reasons like Philip Bailey
Can't get enough of that funky stuff
Rhymin' astronomical, original, shit is phenomenal
Heat up the ghetto put the pedal to the metal
Speed like Racer treat you like a wack rhyme and erase ya
Right off the paper, roll a big fat spliff
Four-fifth on the hip, Heineken in the grip shit I'm ready
Get the keys for the jeep, let's bounce
Cruise avenues, get some brews and sing the blues with the
Funkmaster Flex cassette in the deck
I'm in effect I move my neck while Son gets wreck
Oh what a feeling, I'm on the wheels of steel and
I snatch up some skins for some sexual healing
Erything's kosher copacetic, groovy hip-hop moves me
Soothes me, I'm letting off like an uzi
But first steps a doozy and bruise me
Now I'm choosy before I start to freak it like a floozy
I wanna get big get paid true stunt
You know what I want!

So the ninety-four to them I pour my niggas that remember
Means I'm steppin to the mic with lyrics colder than December
[Brrrr!] The liquidator with the hardcore demanor's
Bustin out the perpetrators I see through em like a Zima
So I'm never caught between a hard place and a rock
Cause I kill rhyme bandits bare handed like Mr. Spock
I told chief not to start no beef
He tried to shoot me with his gun I caught the bullet with my teeth
Cause I'm stronger than the bull that's on the Schlitz Malt Liquor
Hittin up your cities with the Alkaholik sticker
Cause I feel like bustin loose
It's the wicked pain inflictor with the Mickey's deuce deuce
Droppin rhymes like a boulder on the twenty-one and older
That's what your momma with my picture tattooed on her shoulder

Watts, Willabrooke, even shook, when I took
A fresh-ass hook out my notebook
""Dan-na-dah, dan-na-dah"" - I love sports
I even watch soccer and the girls on the tennis courts
You try to tackle me you couldn't make me fall
Cause I been movin ahead since the day I learned to crawl
Y'all, aww shit, let me make a wish
I wish all the bunk MC's turn to fish

[Intro: Lauryn Hill]
Yo, this is the Fugees.. Refugees
About to take you on a journey
Into the dimensions of the Booga-Basement
The basement, word
Hey yo, one two three! The crew is called Re-Fu-Ge-ee-es
An if you come to test the rap stylee
Stop the violence and just bring it on, willld

[Verse One: Lauryn Hill]
Hey yo I, feel kind of melancholy people think they really know me
I keep a rap-book with me while I'm driving daddy's Audi
I pay the toll fighting for my own soul
Cause the bourgeoise type of mental sucks like a black hole
But I be baitin the rebel base to bass distort the EQ
The devil's wishin they could send me back to Mogadishu
Cause I've been wild since I was a juvenile
Afro-centric profile, back when righteous rap was your style
Now kids are whylin so I ask the bad black
Boogie bandit, what's the damage, gimme the estimate then
Pray tell me when's the revolution will begin?
I turn on my TV I check out Farrakhan on CNN see
I'm like the phantom that's flying like the bird do
And things you never heard plus I come from the suburbs
Word to God, I heard you're acting kind of hard

A rapper, disaster, nobody ever told me that
""Roxanne, you don't got to work for money no more!!""... and...
Back in the days I used to listen to Kool G Rap
Way back when before guns became gats and
Run-D.M.C. used to ask Mary was she buggin?
I loved P.E., they kept me concious of what I was saying
Afrika Bambaata, Poor Righteous Teacher
Got within myself so it made me a Five Percenter
Say La-Di-Da-Di, UHH! we like to party but
My jam was BDP, with My Philosophy
Say Grandmaster Flash, MC Melle Mel
Then LL Cool J came with Rock the Bells!
See I'm the one for the crew, like a Jew is a Jew
Like Apollo got the moon, like the men who got the blue
Like the Fu got the Manchu, Shaka got the Zulu
Hawaii got the Honolulu
I got the rap lieu, so skippedy-de-bop-bop you don't stop

These are the tales the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
You dont like my dirty raps? You can go to hell
Cause $hort Dawg is on the mic spittin Cocktales

[Verse 1]
H-E-A-D
All you washed-up hoes trying to throw that P
You're just a big freak, you better not complain
When you hear these cocktales and you hear your name
If you a fake bitch, ain't no thing
I'll pick up the phone and call Janine

If I call Marie, I know for a fact
I'm getting sucked in my drop-top Cadillac
I met this freak named Naomi
Straight dick-sucker, worked me and my homies
She had a girlfriend, her name was Vickie
I pulled her to the side and let her suck my dick

She was fine as fuck, but can't fuck with Tina
Tina, Tina, the sperm cleana'
I took her to my house and I told her ""strip""
Baby got freaky - started doing the splits
I said, ""Bee-yotch! Do what you want
Cause this true-blue mack won't even front""
I fucked her with my finger, she tried to cum
Pussy so tight it wouldn't give me none
I'm Too Short, baby, couldn't be no punk
I'm trying to get freaky cause I love the funk
My dick is big and her nigga had a little one
I didn't fuck her freaky ass but it was still fun

I know you stop and wonder just what it is
It's the California lifestyle that I live
See I'm from the Crew, Dangerous, Bitch
I get on the mic and spit that freaky shit
I know this girl named Annette
Get her all alone and she'll suck your dick
Hella freaky, won't say no for shit
You and her all alone, nigga, that's your bitch

I know another freak her name's Joanne
I always get the pussy cause I know I can
Finest bitch around, ain't got no man
Every time she cross my mind I go fuck her again
She's like another bitch named Christina
Bitch so dumb, I named her ""misdemeanor""
Cause it had to be a crime to be that dumb
I took her to my house and she let me cum in her mouth
You know I did all that shit
She got my number, if she beep me, I'm gonna call that bitch
And go dig in them guts like a gardener
If she starts screaming I'm gonna fuck the bitch harder

[Hook]
Cause these are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales I tell so well
You don't like my dirty rap you can go to hell
Cause Short Dogg's on the mic telling cocktales

[Verse 2]
I meet the groupies, hookers like Kathy
Fucking MC's cause she's so nasty
See her backstage trying to throw that ass
She just like the freaks and she had to pass me that pussy
You can't stop the bitch
Let her roll on my vogues then I drop the bitch
My name is Short, my game is long
I freak these hoes and sing these songs
I know a bitch named Stephanie
Do anything she can to have sex with me
She really don't bring out the best in me
But I love her fine ass laying next to me

She's like another freak named Nicole
So damn sprung on my diamonds and gold
I took her to my house, she gave me the panties
I fucked her so good she told her friend named Angie
Angie called me up about 2 weeks later
Talking some shit about ""do me, player""
So I did her just like Tamara
Taking naked pictures with my Polaroid camera
Next they told a bitch named Raquel
Got my skin all under her fingernails
She was digging in my back while I grind the shit
That was way back, now I can't find the bitch
But if I do, I'll probably do the same again
Break the bitch for everything, cause I came to pimp
I'm Too Short, baby, I don't stop macking
I grab the microphone and I don't stop rapping
You can bet your life as I spit these raps
I'll be fucking em up like that, bitch!

I know a bitch, her name was Sherry
I had to cut her loose cause she wanted to get married
Pussy so good and I do mean very
Sometimes it's shaved and sometimes it's hairy
I'm Short Dogg, ain't nothing nice
You ever make me mad and I'll fuck your wife
Have fun with your bitch and have her sprung on my dick
I guess I'll pull it out and just cum on your bitch

Like my other little tramp named Erica
Anywhere I want to fuck, that's where I fuck
Cause she's the freakiest bitch in America
And every time I get the pussy, I just tear it up

Cause these are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
You dont like my dirty raps you can go to hell
Cause Short Dog is on mic spittin Cocktales
Be-yotch!  And it dont stop to the beat

Who the fuck is this? Paging me at 5:46
In the morning, crack of dawn and
Now I'm yawning, wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this paging me and why?
It's my nigga, Pop, from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down love, please chill, drop the caper

[Pop]
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Yeah my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah them my niggas nah love wouldn't disrespect

[Pop]
I didn't say them, they schooled me to some niggas
That you knew from back when, when you was clocking minor figures
Now they heard you're blowing up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warning me cause now I'm warning you
I got the Mac, nigga tell me what you gonna do

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

[Pop]
They heard about the Rolexes and the Lexus
With the Texas license plates out of state
They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown
And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down
They even heard about the crib you bought your moms out in Florida
The Fifth Corridor

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singing and flower bringing
If my burglar alarm starts ringing
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed em gunpowder, so they can devour
The criminals trying to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament, where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck! What I'mma hit you with you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket - he had a gun he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on you rasshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa comes for you?
I'm not running, nigga I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody coming

[Intro: KRS-One]
Uhh! Yeahhh
I know you're diggin this type of shit right here
We about to spark it on the mic, yeahhh
Come on!

{*scratched 4X: ""All we do is spark mad izm""*}

[KRS]
The episode starts when I walk down the block kid
Reach in my poc-ket, yo where's my knot, it
Follows me into the spot, compellin
Go check the dread and yes he's herb sellin
A punani gate, I'm a potential felon
Izm is smellin, like I ain't even tellin
Channel one two, I'm smashin the law
Channel three, I make a run to the store
Channel four leave the store with the Phillie cause I...
Spark the izm, I'm off to Channel Live

[Hakim]
Wake up in the mornin got the yearnin for herb
Which loosens up the nouns, metaphors, and verbs
And adjectives, ain't it magic kid what I'm kickin
Multi-flavored bags of sess, for the pickin
So listen to the izm as it talks non-stop
Hawaiian when I'm rhymin but so is the chocolate thai
Now the high, starts to settle
Kickin fat lyrics that rocks, like heavy metal

[KRS]
I'm comin' out to dance with da spliff of sensei 
When I speak, big up Mack, L.O., and Malik
Like John Lennon, yes I'm I-Z-M'n
I start grinnin, and syllables start bendin
My style is untangible, like a wild animal
Check the label as it goes round it's on Capitol
That's what I'm smackin you with cause it's easy
Like Lionel Richie, your whole style is bitchy
Switch me, mix me, somebody get me
Don't let me rip out my clothes like Bill Bixby
Rippin the microphone 'til I'm motherfuckin sixty
Smokin the indo, by the window, it's sticky

[Tuffy]
Come spark the izm, my expertism, is lyricism
My flow will take you over, like I was hypnotism
So where's the lighter, to decipher, the skills that I'm bringin
Hyper than a little kid on ginseng roots
And culture, my intellect will insult ya
Finish off your dead mind like a vulture
I gotta get mine, get a grip
Cause there's all these weak rappers steady makin hits, FUCK THAT!
But ninety-four I bring the skills back
So listen now I'm doin what I want to do and sparkin mad izm

{*scratched 8X: ""All we do is spark mad izm""*}

[Tuffy]
I come with notions, deeper than the ocean
Check out my potion, mad rhythm in the motion
The izm, brings the wisdom, when I kick it on the rhythm
Check it how I rock it in a cipher
Desire, takes you higher, lyrical messiah
(Yo yo yo yo-yo, pass that lighter)
Counterclockwise, I rise like the sun
Now feel the heat from the rays of the gun
Shootin out the mental mist
How you gonna know the real shit when your style's counterfeit?

[KRS]
His shit is counterfeit cause he's motherfuckin phony
Come into the jam try to front like he know me
Hah! Listen to this new type of somethin
Bumpin, ninety-four ain't for no frontin
New type of lingo, catchy like a jingle
Rougneck hip-hop is drippin from the single
Now, let me introduce you to the one
The Channel Live indo this loosens you up
Goin through the channels of the remote control
Flickin through the frequencies of your soul

[Hakim]
Then roll the izm, the inflater, I'm weeded
Like wearing a sweater, at the equator, I'm heated
But I flip a style like I flip a channel
Step up and test the skills, you can get my tes-ticules
Cause hip-hop's been running through my veins ever since
So it wasn't hard for me to grab the mic and represent
Representing tormenting MC's craniums
Till they can't flow why cause I'm drainin em
Don't mean to be blunt but don't front
I'm doing it for the love so now I'm doin what I want
To do with my Channel Live crew so just listen
Dissin wack MC's and sparking up mad izm

Check it, check it, Black Thought, is in the house
And uhh, Malik B, is in the house
We're groovin out, yes in the house
*discordant talk*
...
Just get on the mic with your master plan

Verse One: Malik B

I can make you dance, I can make you shout
The scripts in the scroll turned the whole party out
Inject my lyrics in a sec with dialect
Why accept, because it's from the highest eye and depth
Rap extrordinaire share me never ever
See through because I be true, Malik's together
Intox your cells till your brain vein swells
Niggas'll claim terror when their never parellel
Once I have a hunch that there's MC's that front
I just crunched a whole bunch, in one big munch
I always stand firm, under any term
My actions never squirm cuz my tracks is perm
I have a tendency to defend this MC
My residency is simply in sensei
I makes it vivid, on different continents of earth I pivot
It seems extreme and exquisite but ask it is it
My style is like a cat from a seventies flick
Talkin jive as he strut with his afro pick
Or a predator, just before he stalks his pray
When I talk this way, I do dismay
See you're puzzled, now how I think you're trying to juggle
My mind is like a nine M double, now there's trouble
The Roots bring you styles and all types of creed
I sign off but I shall proceed

Chorus:

I shall, proceed, and continue, to rock the mic (4X)

Verse Two: Black Thought

Yo, we could get fly, we could get fly
We could get fly that's the anthem of my
Crew not to glorify but it's sorta high
Troubles of the world bring tears to my eye wonder why
My man, can't vaccinate, y'all know the fate
Similar to the way I'm a disease on tape
To escape Metropolis is such a violent state
I spill words over pages, styles over phrases
From the world's different stages for crowds of different ages
Though not a nova, you witness like Jehovah
Now niggas beg for lyrical plague to pass them over
Righ right niggas is like stick up kids
Doin bids you got caught, enter the Black Thought
I interface with bass when I communicate
Crowds I elevate, to another mindstate of
Rap thinking, see musically the Black thinking rhythm
Therefore, I give em what I'm giving, therefore
I give em what I'm giving that's the hardcore
The Roots'll keep it real for sure, and I shall proceed

Chorus

Rockin on the microphone I do this well (repeats)
*crowd cheers*

Lil' Dap: Damn son
Melachi: What the fuck is wrong with you man?
Shit shouldn't be happening out here man
Niggas don't be realizin' the shit, man
But yo, tell 'em what you be seein' out your window
Lil' Dap: Yo I be seeing out my window gunshots everyday
Melachi:Man yo I be seeing sex money and drugs too but yo
Tell 'em how Duke said
Lil' Dap: The world's about to end

[Verse 1: Melachi the Nutcracker]
Born in the ghetto it's hard to survive
Some have achieved and many brothers tried
But I realized which life to choose
I wanna make money so I gotta pay dues
But there's no rules and you only have one chance
If ya fuck up kid you face the circumstance
At night I used to scream and shout
Livin' in the ghetto trying to get the hell out
So I would try as I watch my friends die
But all I could do was sit back and cry
These are feelings I'm expressing through my rhymes
I been through hard times so many problems on my mind
I wasn't living rich and I also wasn't poor
I try to appreciate but I deserve more
Yeah superman supa star
Give me super fat dough like Pablo Escobar
""Super duper star""

[Verse 2: Lil' Dap]
Feared by bandits hated by chicks
Loved by kids I never did a bid
Yes the Group Home is thick
Plus I don't eat beef cause get dizzy if ya think shit is weak
Yo I work hard and hard my man trace it down to the car
After that keep it movin' have no time to be foolin'
Around town A&R's you get down with the hype sound
The things I say will make a grown man dream
I speak sayings ""Go by yourself, be by yourself""
Let my lyrics vibrate and shake the earth
I travel ghetto to ghetto back streets to the street
Kick a rhyme or crime with this ill mastermind
Mom dukes used to tell me with these tears in her eyes
Now I'm out on my own survival with the dime
Like an African tribe little Dap will blow your mind
Check it out like this

Melachi:
And then like that

""Super star""

[Verse 3: Melachi]
Walkin' the tunnels of hell the next level
It's the Nutcracker givin' hell to the devil
Playin' the game the New York pain
Makes me wanna bust but I just maintain
Cause nowadays I talk to a brother
Always love your mother cause you'll never get another
In the streets bustin' off shots fuck the cops
I got superstar props
Big time doe, money is a thriller
I'm gettin' more iller than the Zodiac killer
No lie but before I say bye
You can't take money with cha when you die

""Super duper star""

[Verse 4: Lil' Dap]
Yo I got niggas flipping they wig
Chicks grabbing they cunts
As they rhyme they get doper and then they greet me with blunts
One times for your mind before I brake these streets
Ain't nothing holding me back hip hop track
Yo son you know the feelin' shit will get revealed
As the times will get better
And you know I got skills I seen the days turn into nights
As the stars shine bright
Motherfuckers Moet and chicks they keep steppin'
Like Dom Perignon one day will live large
Word to Allah and it don't seem hard
No more jealousy and envy
Curse is put upon me
Watch me live free at the clink
With my niggas you'll see
Raising to the top like a rocket ship, yo I go far
""Super star""

I'm the one-man army, Ason
I never been tooken out, I keep MCs looking out
I drop science like girls be dropping babies
Enough to make a nigga go crazy
In the G-Building, taking all types of medicines
Your ass thought you were better than
Ason, I keep planets in orbit
While I be coming with deeper and more shit
Enough to make you break and shake your ass
As I create rhymes good as a Tastykake makes
This style, I'm mastered in
Niggas catching headaches, what? What? You need Aspirin?
This type of pain, you couldn't even kill with Midol
Fuck around, get sprayed with Lysol
In your face like a can of mace, baby
Is it burning? Well, fuck it, now you're learning
How I don't even like your motherfucking profile
Give me my fucking shit: CH-CH-BLAOW!
Not seen and heard, no-one knows
You forget: niggas be quiet as kept
Now you know nothing
Before you knew a whole fucking lot
Your ass don't wanna get shot
A lot of MCs came to my showdown
And watched me put your fucking ass low down
As you can go, below zero
Without a doubt I never been tooken out
By a nigga, who couldn't figure
Yo by a nigga, who couldn't figure
Yo by a nigga, who couldn't figure (Brooklyn Zoo)
How to pull a fucking gun trigger
I said ""Get the fuck outta here!""
Nigga wanna get too close, to the utmost
But I got stacks that'll attack any wack host
Introducing - yo fuck that nigga's name
My Hip Hop drops on your head like rain
And when it rains it pours, cause my rhymes hardcore
That's why I give you more of the raw
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Whoa-hoa-hoa! Let me like slow up with the flow
If I move too quick, oh, you just won't know
I'm homicidal when you enter the target
Nigga get up, act like a pig trying to hog shit
So I take yo ass out quick
The mics, I've had it my nigga, you can suck my dick
If you wanna step to my motherfucking rep
CH-CH-BLOAW! BLOAW! BLOAW! Blown to death
You got shot cause you knock knock knock
""Who's there?"" Another motherfucking hardrock
Slacking on your macking cause raw's what you lack

[Produced by Havoc]

[Intro]
Word up, son, word, yeah
To all the killers and a hundred dollar billers
For real, niggas who ain't got no feelings
Check it out now

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous
You heard of us, official Queensbridge murderers
The Mobb comes equipped for warfare, beware
Of my crime family who got 'nough shots to share
For all of those who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nose bone
You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for they self in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews runnin', like they supposed to
They come around, but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team, and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
Your simple words just don't move me
You're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight; my gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only 19, but my mind is old
And when the things get for real, my warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothing really, ayo, Dun, spark the philly
So I can get my mind off these yellow-backed niggas
Why they still alive? I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation
If I die, I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate, you feel a burnin' sensation
Gettin' closer to God in a tight situation
Now take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you

[Hook]
Son, they shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
‘Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look
Livin' the live that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
Some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son; he's just a shook one

[Verse 2: Havoc]
For every rhyme I write it's 25 to life
Yo, it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguardin' my life
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge and we don't play
I don't got time for your petty-thinkin' mind
Son, I'm bigger than those
Claimin' that you pack heat, but you're scared to hold
And once the smoke clears
You'll be left with one in your dome
Thirteen years in the projects—my mentality is what, kid?
You talk a good one, but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?
Or am I goin' to burn in Hell for all the things I did?
No time to dwell on that, ‘cause my brain reacts
Front if you want, kid, lay on your back
I don't fake DATs, kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid, you out of line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin', E&J got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin', diggin' my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot, kid, you know my function
‘Cause long as I'm alive I'ma live illegal
And once I get on, I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MAC's, I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleepin', ‘cause I'm creepin'

[Hook]
Son, they shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
‘Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
‘Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
‘Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Livin' the live that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
Some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son; he's just a shook one

[Outro]
To all the villains and a hundred dollar billers
To real brothers who ain't got no feelings
G-yeah, the whole Bridge
Queens get the money
41st side, keepin' it real, you know
Queens get the money

730,6935,Redman,Can't Wait,11,1995-02-25,"

[Production by Erick Sermon & Reggie Noble]

[Intro: Redman]
Whooooooo! Yo yo yo, comin to you live
Smokin mad Phillies with my niggas from the Hooterville section
And all my niggas from the Weak Way section, word is bond
Somebody said Jamaica Queens in this motherfucker
I don't give a fuck! We gon' set it off like this
Jersey in the fuckin hid-ouse, with the did-ouse

[Verse 1: Redman]
I'm like rah rah, like I had cerebral palsy
My flows be's wet like all you girls' drawers be
Crack the Phills, spread the buddha then the hiddash
Roll it up and then ask, who chipped in for the ten bag?
Et cetera, I roll my blunts with two textures
Pick up fifty bags and then I smoke all the extras
It's the truth, like vodk' one-eighty proof
Don't drop your drawers, I'll fuck through your daisy dukes (true!)
Put your fingers up in the air if you're high (high)
I walk by (by) so eff a drive (by)
I swing up in it, batting average is half as
Good as Reggie Jackson's that's why you talk backwards
Enough, chumps be on some Bogart shit like Humphrey
You couldn't beat me if you ran with 21 Jump Street
Or 90210, fuck it yo
In the movies I'm the nigga puffin buddha in the back row

[Hook: Repeat 8X]
I can't wait to get it on

[Verse 2: Redman]
I'm just a smoky boy, I'm from the Land of the Lost
You can't see me, like Charlie Angels' boss, I'm often
Coolin 'round the blid-docks, I rock round the clid-dock
My glid-dock cocked, from here to 16th and Lennox
Ask Roger Thomas if I'm gettin scopic
I was milk like two tits, now I'm butter like Blue Bonnet
Now who got the funk? (We got the funk!)
Ay ay ayo well I got the weed! (We got the blunts!)
I never sniffed, I used to puff woolies in a jam
Back in eighty-eight, when it was twenties to the gram
Bizzail, you couldn't feel me in Braille, hell
I write my names on walls in smoke spots when I'm buyin L
The fly guy with the Force like Luke Sky'
Down for a menage e' trois bitch if you're fly
The Funkadelic, been rockin mics since the fourth grade
I Terminate like X and I Terminate like Schwarzeneg'
Dum-de-dum, rock like Buju Banton
Soup like wonton, funk by the tons, ""D-Rums Please!""
My whole crew's making cheese
Tonight's the night baby, so suck up on these, and it's on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Redman]
I said I, catch the A-train, to the left
Smoke the choc', I set shit off like Boba Fett
Big up to all my niggas in the housing projects
I'm runnin up in ya contingents to split your guts
Grab the rail, if you get scared of my lines when I rock well
Got Whit's like Pernell, shit's ""Da Bomb"" like Akinyele
Rickety rocket, mind deep as the Loch Ness
Waste niggas like toxic, wet like galoshes
Can I handle my biz? (Yes you can!)
I cause chaos, and bring a lot of Def to Jams
Yes I can, now act stupid I'll pop the trunk
Cla-clunk, now give me a ba-bump, ba-bump
Oh cool, smooth like two ""Blue Suede Shoes""
Y'all faggots slept on my Huffman and Koos
Word to Dan, Tan, Pillow and Cool B
Switching speeds like Bruce Lee ridin a Fuji in a movie
I drop it on the one, fuck the two-three
Funky like a box of Coogis on loose leaf

Yo yo, I said..
Switchin up speeds, like Bruce Lee, ridin a Fuji, in a movie
Heh, I be sayin some shit!
Now.. if you didn't get it..
Laugh now.. and then figure the shit out when you get home!

[Intro]
*Heart rate under control*
Uh huh
Yeah
1 2 1 2
Fire up fire up this funk if ya have to
*Inhale* *Exhale*
Smoken' up blunts
Mad Dog 20 20
Fire up fire up this funk if ya ...

[Verse 1]
I grab the forty rip off the skirt
Guzzle it, grab the mic and come out the woodworks
When shit's thick and no time to think
Keeps Murray busy off of Basic Instinct
I puff an L and drink some liquor
Sit down and write a jam that receive the muhfuckin' stick-UP(A blessing from Buddha for grinding hard, the right way. See: KARMA.)
As God as my witness, with the sickness
Of a cannibalist cannabis
I floats like a cumulus
My perpetual rebel intellectual
Won't catch a bad experience with hallucinogenics either
I float strictly with the cannabis sativa
As my speech falls deeper than the scriptures
I smite graphic opponents, just like Picasso paintin' pictures(agreed? :))
If my eyes ain't red, it's all in my head
Once said by a Ph.D med
Legalize and I'll advertise, 'cos

[Refrain]
Yeah, I get lifted
Roll a Phillie and get
Roll a Ziggy and get
Fire up this funk
Yeah, like that y'all
Yeah word up, I get lifted
Roll/Puff the Phillie and get
Roll/Puff the ziggy and get
Fire up this funk, fire up this funk

[Verse 2]
This the real deal not a publicity stunt
I gets high like if the man in the Moon be puffing blunts
But verily barely merrily is it dope or the dream
Step into my chamber of intravenous smokescreen
I captivate it then motivate it, jealous of my desire
Smoke it down to the fire, anything to get a little higher
Hop in to college (accepting reality, facing), but to be truthfully frank (but still stays true and speaks true(TRU...))
Weed is knowledge, cause it makes me think
I pick anatomy and hem reality like Jah
Rastas read the bible, after puffin sensimillia
And the Sensi it gets me as a Fly(zZz), I ain't bullshitting
You can ask Bill Clinton, he can verify that

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Step into this intersection and take this rap
I got a vicious plot but first take me by the weed spot - http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fodCR0ilnGI/ThoWZubbvyI/AAAAAAAACTA/AnSFPsViq4E/s1600/evil_weed.jpg
I do this for my niggas locked down runnin capers
Smokin herb, in the bible papers
But how does it feel when you got no fire
And kyant pass de dutchie pon de left hand side (You can't pass the dutchie to the left 'cos the HEAT's outside?)
What the fuck, who the fuck wanna fuck (If U advertise your concern about Society's direction with heart, you'll wake up the sleeping(zZz) Gods (eg. Keith Murray)
With the six shot shooter, I murder you over buddha (Intellect at such a lvl, even a Buddhist Scholar can NO comprehende) See: Q :)
What I discuss'll bust a rhyme style nucleus
And roast them ghostes, puffin hocus pocus
So kid, pass that bomb (word: TRIBE) trom word bond (pass the VIBE WORLDWIDE)
So I can toke it with more wins than a python
Different Strokes for different folks
He like the chocolate thai
You like to float with the green skunky smoke
Roll up a fat one and pass it around
Laid back hypnotized to the funky sound cause (Let yourself get captivated by the moment)

[Refrain]

Yo man, what's that guy's name, the Green Eyed Bandit
He worked with Redman, Redman, whatever the fuck his name is
- I would love to fuck a blue-skinned green-eyed girl (Avatarish)

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, what up, this is Dr. Dre
The party's goin' on
Thank God it's Friday

(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)
(Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!)

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
Keep their heads ringin'!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringin'!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
(Hey you! Sittin over there)
Say what?
(You better get up out of your chair)
That's right
(And work your body down)
Yeah
(No time to funk around, cause we gon')
Funk you right on up
So get up: get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me ""Blacula""
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keeping it real enables me to make another mil'
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple: so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes' panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringin'!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
1, 2 for the crew, 3, 4 for the dough
5 for the hoes (hoes!) 6, 7, 8 for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect - plus a check
Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right: I'm gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringin'!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)

[Bridge]
If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sending all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the backdrop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you, so just call me Mop 'n Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6'1"", 225, I'm pure chocolate
Your chances of jacking me are slim, G
Cause I rock from summer until Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro
So, check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their motherfuckin' heads ringin'!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringin'!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringin'!
(Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Yeah, uh, come on!

[Bridge]
If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down
If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down

[Outro]
I know you're bobbin' your head
Cause I can see you
I know you're bobbin' your head
Cause I can see you
You can't see me!
Death Row, let me know you in the house (Beyotch!)
Yeah, that's right, we out

[Intro]
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin' in the ghetto
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
June 16th, 1971
Mama gave birth to a hell-raisin' heavenly son
See, the doctor tried to smack me, but I smacked him back
My first words was, ""Thug for life!"" and ""Papa, pass the MAC!""
I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers ballin'
Listen, you can hear my mini fourteen callin'
From out the window of my drop top
I got my Glock cocked, bustin' at niggas; when will it stop?
Now, tell me, are you scared of the dark?
Can't close my eyes, I see visions
And even with this thug livin', will I escape prison?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance; and if you slang
Then you'd better have your Nikes on, ‘cause when we fight, it's in the middle of the night with no lights on
Hey! There must be a God, ‘cause I feel lucky
Paranoid, out my mind, ‘cause motherfuckers tryin' to rush me
Am I goin' to jail? Look at me bailin'
Comin' out the court house, all about my mail and bank
Never die, I'll be a hustler, motherfuckers
Makin' thugs out you suckers, from the cradle to the grave

[Hook]
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin' in the ghetto

[Verse 2: Mopreme]
From the cradle to the grave, since a little bitty child
I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild
Pop pop! Just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm runnin' up the block in the dark where lead spark
Surveillance on a nigga every day
Waitin on my daddy just to take his ass away
Now Mama always workin', tryin' to make ends meet
So now a young nigga's being raised by the streets
And then the only other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle, strung out on drugs
A straight thug, just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gats, one black and one of chrome
Now, I don't wanna hurt nobody, but I must defend mine
It's all the fuck I got, so stop and walk a thin line
Young niggas be brave
And keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave

[Hook]
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin' in the ghetto

[Verse 3: Rated R]
From the cradle to the grave, I'm glad to say I made it this far
Many G's died, hogs
And all they got was they name hit up on a wall
It's sad thinkin' about the times, life goes on
I'm steady lost in this land, that's the war zone
I gots no home, don't have no friends neither
It's just me by my lonely, so I married my Nina
I keeps her wherever I go, I love my ho
Never leave home without my sugar, I'ma have to plug a nigga
Mama told me not to trust no punks
And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me
Since then I been knowin'
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
‘Cause I stay shootin' at marks
Get twisted up in police reports
Since the cradle, I've been ungrateful
My first toy was a gun
I got sprung and learned to love weapons
But now I'm through with money
And through with street fame
Somebody peeled my cap, and put me in my grave

[Hook]
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin' in the ghetto

[Verse 4: Macadoshis]
March 18th, a rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in Hell on Earth
From day one it wasn't fun, I never had a crumb
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum
I tried to cope, loc, but my family's broke
And my pocket's short, so now I got ta slang dope
In the game filled with pain, it's a fuckin' shame
The white man got a motherfucker slangin' 'caine
So now it's on from dusk to dawn, I'm gettin' my serve on
Always in the spot with my Glock, slingin' rocks at the Rox
The shit don't stop, I'm steady dodgin' cops
I never flip-flop, hear my Glock cock, thug 'til I drop
And if I hit the pen, I gotta do my time
Sittin' on my bunk, reminiscin' 'bout the good times
It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doin' dirt
But from the cradle to the grave I'ma put in work

[Hook]
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin' in the ghetto

[Verse 5: Big Syke]
Time's movin' fast; will I last another day?
So I pray and I lay with my AK
Did I sell my soul as a young kid? All the things I did
Wishin' someone held me, but they never did
I can't take it; will I make it to my older age
Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin' cage?
Lord, help me, guide me, save me!
‘Cause that's the way that Daddy raised me: crazy
Do or die, nigga, pull the trigger, don't give a fuck
You'd rather be in jail than get yo' ass bucked
Nobody cares, it's me against the world
Keepin' murder on my mind and my TEC-9
I got nothin' to lose, payin' dues, nigga, you wanna die?
I get high and then my mission is a walk-by
You'd better jet when I hit your set, ‘cause I'm comin'
Start runnin', yellin' ""evil mind"" as I'm gunnin'
One in the chamber, for the anger that I build inside
For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died
The beginnin' is an endin', am I just a slave?
So I got to be brave, from the cradle to the grave

[Hook]
From the cradle to the grave
Life ain't never been easy
Livin' in the ghetto

[Intro: Harlem Nights]
""Quik you're not a gangster, we're not""

[Intro]
Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
*You know that money's got you safe and sound*

[Verse 1]
Now I'm bout to take it back to '84, when I was 14
Kickin' back in the trees, Westside if you please
And 436 West Spruce was the spot
With me Wayne, Mike, Shot, Nookie, Slug, and Rock
Donzelly if you with me, just let that shit kick
If your head ain't spinning from dippin' all them sticks
Cause way back in the day they used love a wet baggie
Screaming ""Órale ese"" with them laces on that Caddy
And you couldn't deny a hit from that Buddah Thai
Going 'round and 'round the driveway, now it's coming my way
And I'm zoned out, at a young age
And the whole Spruce Street was my stage
Peep, now back then I was in the 8th grade steady
But niggas my age was getting paid already
Yeah, like that nigga Zap, or even young Blue
They made they first million by the age of 22
Like Dan from Cedar block, him and little Motor
James from Piru Street with them boulders
Rest in peace little Noopy, he didn't have to brag
Rollin to the 10th grade in a fin-O rag
Well Goddamn, how can I be down?
I asked my sister Jack for some help and she told me look around
Nigga, they don't sell dope, it sells itself
While they kickback and just collect the wealth
And now I'm thinking...
Ain't nothing fly about these dirty ass khakis
T-shirt dingy, Pro Wings tacky
This could be a way for me to flip that little funky twenty dollars that I earned
Right then is when I learned that...

[Hook]
Some believe in Jesus, some believe in Allah
But niggas like me believe in making dollars
Cause even when your niggas wanna be untrue
*You know that money's still good to you*
Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
*You know that money's got you safe and sound*

[Verse 2]
Peep, I gets a dub on the 1st and 15th for a fact
So instead of spending it up I gave my money to Jack
Now she jump in the rig and said 'I'll be right back'
When she came in she put me down with a plastic sack
I turned my 40 into 80 and that was my profit
I'm keepin' my rocks in the house and not in my pocket
Sister Jackie's in the kitchen with some boiling water, baking soda, fresh powder, baby bottles, making more boulders
Checking a fat grip slanging rocks to tricks
Donzelly dippin' sticks, went and bought him a 6
And 500 block Peach running thangs ya see
Moving gallon after gallon and ki after ki
I'm telling you I done seen it all
From niggas hitting the sherm and then they pass out on the wall
From cluckers wanting a hit so bad they let their panties fall
Teeth rotten, hair gone, and whole checks get blown
But yet I'm still breaking these pebbles like bam bam
Safety pin splitting rocks to the, um, tic toc
I went from wearing khakis to Sergio Tacchini
While my rocks are disappearing like the great Houdini
I bought a gang of clothes, all of my equipment
And getting something new with each and every shipment
Money gets made and money gets spent
And how these jealous niggas acting only makes it evident that...

[Hook]
Some believe in Jesus, some believe in Allah
But niggas like me believe in making dollars
Cause even when your niggas wanna be untrue
*You know that money's still good to you*
Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
*You know that money's got you safe and sound*

[Verse 3]
Check it, now in 1988 I moved away to L.A
My niggas Playa Hamm and Gina gave me a place to stay
On my way up from bottom rock
Bitches starting to jock
Cause my hair is getting longer
And game's getting stronger
To pull my on weight I went and got me a job
But by then, Hamm and Gina really started to squab
About whether I should go or stay
She told him 'Either he goes or you go'
We both was on our way
So he moved and took me with him on 2001 Browning
Clowning with players all around me just astounding
My nigga Pimpin' Carl got us staring with that hair and
Rolling up and down the street in that rag 7 with Darren
Shabby Bleu feathered as he swerved
In the El Co, P7's park away from the curve
Big Jam, L.A Mike, Darryl, Nicky on the bike
That nigga Top, Big Shane, and Tweed rolling up the weed
And hoes just come and go, in and out
Revolving door leaving with some nut in they mouth
I'm making a living off of pimpin' so you fools can't trip
Cause even though I love God, I also love my grip

[Hook]
Some believe in Jesus, some believe in Allah
But niggas like me believe in making dollars
Cause even when your niggas wanna be untrue
*You know that money's still good to you*
Some believe in love and some believe in friends
But niggas like me believe in making ends
Cause even when your bitch wants to trick around
*You know that money's got you safe and sound*

[Outro]
*Ooh, ooh yeah
Safe and sound, yeah
Safe and sound baby
Ooh, ooh, yeah
Safe and sound yeah
Safe and sound
Gotta let you know
Gotta let you know
Gotta let you know
Compton's in the house*

Verse 1: Treach

My thoughts are thundering, tumbling
Sons of bitches, switches, from yelling to mumbling
You ain't a pal of me, my family ties but not with Mallory
My analogy ain't for salary as I roll reality through galaxies
Four centuries, it's sent to me with the scent of weed
With a chain representing penitentiaries
From Roman town to Borentown
From Newark to Illtown
And all you know from
Lifers, Rikers to Folsom
Wasn't driving to fast, I was flying to low
You think I'm rocking too quick, I think you're listening too slow
I'm abrupting construction a pumping assumption
You diss while your family say I'm the best shit since fucking
Struckin behind an obstruction or turning something of nothing from
Poor shit to more shit as I rip in every function
Funking it up, pumping it up, chumping the ducks
Looking to hump Ms. Junk in the Trunk, pump pump me up

Chorus:

Jersey niggas are the craziest
New York niggas are the craziest
DC niggas are the craziest
Philly niggas are the craziest
LA niggas are the craziest
Chi town niggas are the craziest
Texas niggas are the craziest
Utah niggas are the craziest

Verse 2: Vin Rock

My lyrics be laced with 40 ounces of funk and stuff
You get rushed, you get bust, you call yourself callin my bluff, enough's enough - I'm puttin it down on the real end
This one goes out to all the people who be questioning
My skills. Niggas I been rockin since lee twillz
And we feel that we build careers of steel
So all the rest come up and test but only stress is what you'll find thinking
Vinnie don't write and Vinnie can't rhyme Shrinkin
The sleepin MC I eat like good 'n' plenty
Lyrically spankin ya that's why they call me Uncle Vinnie
And oh yes, I just appeal to the masses
Young to old folks, the upper, lower, middle classes
They don't begin wit no lying professor
They begin when Vin pick up the pen and pad up off the dresser
Lest a man should ever challenge the clan
With thirteen years experience of rippin mics put in our hands

Chorus:

Detroit niggas are the craziest
Miami niggas are the craziest
Little Rock niggas are the craziest
Oak Town niggas are the craziest

Verse 3: Treach

I got barbarians to bogard me in
At a club that barred me when
A broad got thrown like barbarnigan born again, thrown aboard
A brim is broke to the back I brawl and band from brains ta balls
Da boots word ta-burr-bam-boo break the loot
Blowing up brain cells BOOM like Beirut
Assume the same suit, fuck that fly shit wit the flavor ca shi
Gives last name ain't Suzuki but still my sidekick
Whip that hide quick if ya slide quick, blood clot ya Blood clique
You ain't rolling if our tape ain't what ya ride wit
Niggas snipe shit so I'm on a knife tip
Like the youngsters 'bout ta take you on some hip-hop ride shit
If you ain't jumpin then don't pump it
I'm hittin Jermaine in Atlanta cos he owe me loot for that jump shit
Fuck astronauts I rock it
And from now on if you bite my style when I see you, I'm in your pockets

Chorus:

Cleveland niggas are the craziest
Virginia niggas are the craziest
Kentucky niggas are the craziest
St. Louis niggas are the craziest
Atlanta niggas are the craziest
Maryland niggas are the craziest
San Diego niggas are the craziest
Seattle niggas are the craziest

Pussy shoved to rise above nonsense, lyrics are able
Turntable spins, round and round we go
Goin for delf, you know, dolo, with a ill flow yo!
""Whutcha want Nine?"" Told you, fat beats like this
A pocket full of grip, mic in my fist, no bullshit
I'm all that and then some, hon blow up like a shotgun
Any MC that disagree is done, you best run
I creep and I crawl and I yes and I y'all
And I refuse to fall, so all in all

The last MC to disagree is now history

Like the edible egg, Arm Leg Leg Arm Head
Who's the dread that said BOOM DA DA?
It's flavor it don't matter, swing batta, swing batta
Knock em out the park, after dark I spark L's
Write rhymes to exercise my brain cells, count the cash in my stash
Cash money money money -- I need
I got a seed to feed and like most a touch of greed
Gettin paid completes the cypher
Bein broke is like havin no blunts, just a lighter

And I am the Nine, gettin mine, no crime

Nuttin can stop me now, I'm on the prowl
You can play the Indian but there's no HOW
I'm the one and only incredible original Nine
Like the sun will shine, I will always rhyme
Like Pam Grier is fine, I gets mine like two nickels
Is a dime, primetime like a new crime
The church bells will chime when I stand at the pulpit
And like Erick give a Sermon, mad money I'm earnin
Remember, the saint ain't as great as the sinner
Like C. Boogie Brown I was born on the 19th day of September
NINE!!!!!! The number one contender!

Hey look away now
Everything's fly
All is real in the Ville
Hey look away now
Look away now, look away

[Verse 1: Mistafiss]
Oh yes we're having a block party, dap to everybody
Don't disturb my groove when I'm trying to get up with this shawty
Now, when you're with your boys, you're rugged and rough
But when you plan on sweet love hanging around you're all cuted up
You got your hat to your side, fronting in your ride
Nissan G system playing thumps that's worldwide
Everybody's saying ""Yeah, that's the jam""
Singing a long set, he got the thump of a live band
Ladies, winter, spring, fall, it don't matter
They still wear they clothes to let you know which one is badder
We be scoping while y'all standing on the block
Waiting for a player like me to scoop ya up
Because of my rep, you gotta accept
When I kick it flamboyant
Many C.B.'s try to spoil it
Mistafiss don't trip cause it's all in the deal
It's all real in the Ville

Aww yeah. Drop it on 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Rosta Swann]
Yeah, '72 is my date of birth
God's gift to the Earth and for all it's worth
Seen things prosper through so much pain
So much love I cry tears of blood
A piece of straw in the jaw, flick the phlegm to the wind
I'm inspired by a city that's rotting from within
I see the fruits of my labor distributed by Caper
Cause Ros' be nibbling punanny
With (cherry flavored Now & Laters, player)
Beat up the block, system pumping like adrenaline
The fly and feminine be whispering ""It's him again""
So look away, but who am I to say?
You're oh so freakalicous and oh yes by the way
The caramel complexion makes you look glazed
Sucking on the lollipops, scoping out the fo' sho' shot
From Chocolate City, wondering, ""Who is he?""
'Cause even off the hook, yo word 'em up, (yo he get's busy)
Style got the soul and got the funk
Got the Q so what else could you want?

(Hey look away now everything's fly)
(Oh my God, look out for him in the sky!)

I get fly without wings or material things
It's the Questionmark Asylum your A&R's wet dream
From the Ville, but not the Village People
Check out the bigger picture through the eye of a needle
(Hey look away now, everything's fly)

[Verse 3: Mistafiss]
You wants to hang around with some fly guys
Ros' Swann, Digge Dom's, Ding Ding
Y'all come around our neighborhood 'cause we're the neighborhood thing
And I'm the Questionmark Asyl'
Y'all get hooked on this C.I. style that's versatile
You look away, you look away, you book a date, baby

Look away, gotta look away now
Look away, gotta look away now

Gotta look away, gotta look away

Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on...

[Verse 1: Big L]
Aiyo, you betta flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers' hearts pumping like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout, and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go BOOM BOOM, and yo' guns go pow pow
I'm known to have a hottie open, I keep the shotty smokin'
Front and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to getting nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques, I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got 35 bodies, buddy, don't make it 36
Step to this, you're good as gone
Word is bond, I leave mics torn when I put it on

[Hook: Kid Capri]
So put it on, Big L, put it on
C'mon, put it onnn, and onnn, and onnn
C'mon, put it on, Big L, put it on
C'mon, put it on, represent, put it on, C'MON!

[Verse 2: Big L]
Nobody can take nothing from Big L but a loss, chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast a shotty
Got more cash than Gotti
You don't know, you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Ha ha, you's a funny nigga
I flows, so one of my shows wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leaving competitors pissed
To tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catching wreck to the break of dawn
In this song, yo, it's a must that I put it on

[Hook]
So put it on, Big L, put it on
C'mon, put it onnn, big fella put it on and onnn
Put it on, Big L
Put it on, represent
Put it on C'mon on put it on

[Bridge: Patois Chatta]
Some boys see me gun nozzle and take a we fi joke
Boy, you gwan dead before you see me gun smoke
See me gun nozzle and take me fi joke
You gwan dead, from a me you provoke

[Verse 3: Big L]
I drink Moet, not Beck's beer, I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangster lean
I see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm putting rappers in the wheelchair
Big L is the villain you still fear
Cause I be hanging in Harlem, and shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread, you can't kill me, I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My rap's steady slamming, I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town, and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples, the Children of the Corn
Cause we put it on, adiós, ghost, I'm gone

[Hook]
So put it on, Big L, put it on
C'mon, put it onnn, big fella put it on and onnn
Big L, you gotta put it on and on
Put it on, Big L put it on ond on
Word up, knahmsayin?
My man Big L, runnin things for the nine-four
And nine-oh-s, you know what I mean?
It's the Kid Capri, in full flair
And we gon' put it on a little somethin' like this
Big L, c'mon

[Outro Big L (Kid Capri):]

I know it sounds bad, but it's all good

(Tales from the hoooood)
I know it sounds bad, but it's all good
These are the tales, tales from the Hood
(Tales from the hoooood)

(Domino)
Well it's a Sunday night
And my hood shows bite
But the playas and hustlas know, we gonna gets that ass tonight
So we can roll out to the South
Can't forget the strap, hell naw
Cuz ain't no tellin' what's right
When homies straight out for the jackin'
Now how many playas know about this
Toss out the weed from the pockets
Scopin' out the city streets
To find that freak for the week
Oh, uh

Chorus

(Chill)
Now these are the tales and you know it's all good
It's all the same it ain't no change in every neighborhood, uh
Now back in the days when I was a scrub
My uncles had me servin' cavi, pushin' dimes to dubs
Now the dimes went to quarters, quarters, went to pounds
And all the fools knew the rules, not to step on our stompin' grounds
Cuz that's when the pop-pop started to holler
You knew that death was always a hard thing for Mama to swallow
Jimmy cracks in the back, beatin' the Hell out his wife
He knew he was wrong, and then he was gone, so he took his own life
Now these a few tales that used to happen
I never said that it was dead because we kept it crackin'
And you know that

Chorus

(Domino)
Now times are so cold
In that damned ghetto
So some of the homies come up, come up, come up
Straight robbin' over liquor stores
Now why should I stay in the wings, when I can sell cavi in a cup?
Think it's wrong if you would
But it's all good in the hood

It get's on my nerves, banked my Danas on the curb
In the gutta lane

Foot to the flo'

I'm broke as a muthafucka nigga buy my single
Comin' from Ingle (Foe Life) is my jingle
Seen yo' bitch at the sto' coulda took her
But niggas start to handcuff they hoes like T.J. Hooker
Fool I'mma vet you can bet
That I can dance underwater and not get wet
It's the nappy headed nigga that can kill and rap
Everybody run when I bust a cap
Puttin' Inglewood up on the map
Look at what I do when I pull my strap
Bust 2 rounds nigga about to clown
Bitch hit the silent alarm it's goin' down

Mack 10 comin' through the hood with stripes
Foe life, foe life

Khacki suit ski mask is my attire
With my luck cut my chucks on the barbed wire
Fool where ya keep the rims and tires
'fo yo' life expires, I'm as nutty as Michael Myers
Didn't think about the Rottweiler
A lot of stiches in the ass, blood in the Impala
Sittin' in the County with a gold record
Ice Cube send me pictures of bitches naked
Caught with a contraband in my hand
Mack 10 take the stand, your Honor I'mma changed man
So please let me go so I can flow
Got a show had to ask my P.O. can I go? and if he say no
I'mma have to say bitch get out the car slow and leave ya fuckin' dough
Cause a nigga gotta eat fuck the world
Let the bullets hurl and feed my baby girl

Yarned up in his birthday suit

My momma wanna know why I do what I do
Cause I'm superman superbad supermad superfly
Fool you can die
There's gonna be a lot of cars with they lights on
And I'm at home sewing stripes on
Cause I'm the General and you's a stowaway
'bout to buck you down with this throw away
With no serial number it's the summer
Where niggas die, it's hotter than July
You better stay low fo' you get a halo
Plus wings and a gown when I come around
So take 10 paces
And try to guess the color of my shoelaces

And then you know Heather B. is back in town

Chorus

Verse 3:

Can't wait until tonight when real niggas turn trife

Snatchin' up da ""L"" like a sniper

If you ever tryta hog up the ""L"" again
Last one to put in first son to dig in
Now I hear you riffin' me while I'm countin' your toke
The henloke burns my throat with no chaser

Blowin' up for da nine four for da nine five
For da nine square either way say word word
Heather B. is in there to the most high
To the most def no quest all Glocks down

[Intro]
Yeah
""Ladies and gentlemen, I've found him. I want you to meet the baddest motherfucker (Right on, right on, right on)""
Who is it?
Well it's Grand Puba, honey
With my man Stud Doogie, love
Droppin' 2000, dig the way this go down
Check it

[Verse 1]
I hit a flow all dipped in lotion
Sit back and sip moe as I'm countin' my doe
Grand Puba Maxwell, Doogie, comin' with the New York
We keep it real like jail when we mic talk
Honeys know cause when I'm in the set
Grand Puba is the one who makes they stink box wet
So let me tell ya somethin' lady
When ya flow this flow then it's all cream and baby
I made this one for the brothers in the party
To find a hottie and dance body to body
Step one, first you grab honey by the waist
Step two, then you move at a ghetto pace
Step three, then ya look her dead in the face
Step four, now its time to leave this place
Hold up, be careful of the cheesa's
The teasa's, the one who wants the money and the visa's
I'ma tell honeys straight off the bat
But please don't even go there with that, dig it
This one's designed to make your spine in your back wind
Grand Puba lights it up for you every time

[Hook]
Ooooh, yeah I like it
And ya say New York City (I like it)
Ooooh, yeah I like it
And ya, and ya say New York City (I like it)
Ooooh, yeah I like it
And ya say New York City (I like it)
Ooooh yeah I lke it
And ya say ( I like it)

[Verse 2]
Could it be I've stayed away too long
Thief MCs be wishin' I was gone
Because they wanna be where I are
But ya can't get that far
So stop wishing on a star
Its only one Grand P
So honey do what you did on the night you creeped with me
Its no doubt I come real with that
The butter track, the one that makes the honeys hit the bed mat
Im energetic, poetic, athletic, with good credit
So just move like I'm Simon and I said it
Ya see my flow is just a step ahead
I'm still wicked in a bed because I'm down right nasty like newlyweds
So back up and let me breathe
Cause when it comes to gettin' down, I'm gettin' looser than a crackhead's hair weave
And I, betcha by golly wow
Y a never find another style like this if ya search a million miles
So why'n cha let Puba nice your party
I hit a flow like Al Jarreau
See I've been doin' this for years
I'm leavin' MC's in tears, tears; dig it
Cause they fallin' just like the rain
Grand Puba's too much for the brain
Now gold diggers who try to get it
I left 'em backwards, they thought they farted when they shitted
Cause Puba's everything, and everything is Pu
Cause I hit 'em with the (one), and then with the (two)
Yeah, cause that's just how Grand Pu and Stud Doogie do
Ya didn't know I was the bomb baby
Somebody should've told you, somebody should have told you

[Hook]
Ooooh, yeah I like it (I like it)
Ooooh, yeah I like it (I like it)
And ya say New York City
Ooooh, yeah I like it (no doubt)
And ya say New York City
Ooooh, yeah I like it
Ha ha, and ya say

[Outro]
Cause we get down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down no doubt
Down for ours we get down
Cause we get down for ours we get down no doubt

[Verse 1: Treach]
You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
Lyrically splittin' dismissin'
I'm on a mission of just hittin'
Now it's written and kitten hittin' with mittens
I'm missin' wishin' man listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishin'
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded I said it word
Damn, you nerd man, you heard
Comin' from the town of Illy and alleys are
Full of Phillies and Rallys suckers get
Silly as Sally then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really

[Hook: Treach]
So here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow

[Verse 2: Treach]
Never mixin' with trickin' brothers bitchin'
Over fixin's that ain't fitting to be hittin'
For nothing splittin' things that's bitten
And gettin' written off
Like a fatter bad bladder boy ya pissing me off
Before you even started so what
So long see you fly by my try how else
Could I say it when you play it try boom bye bye

[Hook]
Here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow
Here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow

[Verse 3: Treach]
The flow pro poetical with skills only
A vet'll know better know where's
The wetter flow that'son point like
Decimals manhandlin' new crews
Partyin' with the Zoo Crew
Lookin' for the pink in poo poo
I thought you knew too stone style is of stamina
Jammin' to while we plannin' to jam
We bust plus we're the party
Amateur damager managin' damagin' mics
Men and even mannequins
You're a fan again now I wanna know whose the man again?
Naughty's back like vertibrates word to hey-a-ho
The way I show you pray I flow
Steady breakin' to the boogie so bang time
To slang bang and watch all the poo tang tangs hang

[Hook: Treach]
Here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow
Here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow

[Verse 4: Treach]
Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
The beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully chase bass lines like bullies
All we wanna know is if your body wanna party
It's nuff poo tang tang for everybody
So hip up and split up get up
Get up your with up souped up put your dukes up
No guts set up for sit ups flip up watch us rip up
Shakes shows until they fizz up
Rizz up like your with us if not zip up
You lip up whip up
Hits with ransom's foul styles get and ones
We come back cause we heard
Hip hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah in fact and for ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flowers
Bevin' these since the seventies
Find me so we went crazy in the eighties
So we won't kiss heinies in the nineties
Oops the Naughty's troop in sections of forties
So clap your hands and hold your shorty I'm Naughty

Here we go now
Holla if ya hear me though, come and feel me flow

[Intro]
People in Oakland, Oakland
See I'm ridin' higher and higher (woah-ohh)
Kinda broke, so y'all know all I got's five, I got five

[Verse 1: Yukmouth]
Player, give me some brew and I might just chill
But I'm the type that like to light another joint, like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S-t. I-d-e-s
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it across the table, like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest, like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around a 40
And when it comes to getting another stogie
Fools all kick in, like Shinobi
No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many hands to be poppin' up, let my friend hit it
Unless you pull out the fat-crispy
Five-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
‘Cause fools be havin' them vacuum lungs
And if you let 'em hit it for free, you hella dum-da-dum-dumb
I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoiding all the thick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos
That be blowing off the land, like, ""Where the bomb at?""
Give me two bucks, you take a puff, and pass my bong back
Suck up the dank like a Slurpee; the serious bomb
Will make a niggy go delirious, like Eddie Murphy
I got more growing pains than Maggie
‘Cause homies nag me to take the dank out of the baggie

[Hook]
I got five on it; grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; it's got me stuck, can not go back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 2: Numskull]
I take sacks to the face whenever I can
Don't need no crutch, I'm so keyed up
'Til the joint be burning my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa
To burn slow, so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension (hahaha)
‘Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no! You better bring your own spliff, chief!
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the joint
Stop hitting, ‘cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
‘Cause I know the weed in my system is gettin' lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P-O
I know I failed, ‘cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a fatty
But the Tanqueray straight had me

[Hook]
I got five on it; grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; it's got me stuck, can not go back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack

[Verse 3: Numskull]
Hey, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane
My yester-night thing got me hung off the night train
You fade, I face, so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the 'land getting smoked with my kinfolk

[Verse 4: Yukmouth]
Been smoked, Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down
Up in the O-A-K, the Town
Homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed, ‘cause where I be we need half, like Umfufu

[Hook]
I got five on it; grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it; messin' with that Indo weed
I got five on it; it's got me stuck, can not go back
I got five on it; partner, let's go half on a sack

Verse 1:

I'm gettin' restless
What guest list?
I'm rushin' the percussion
End of discussion
Now as you were
You rhyme soft like fur
Oh, you write for her?
Now that explain it
But I reign it, I rule it
So cool it, while I school it
Listen, to precision
Rhyming, timing, climbing through your window
(Crooklyn style!) And we in yo
Ravagin' your whole premises
Don't never diss
Cause here's your address
Cause me bad yes, so come test me now
Like Patra, I got it sewn like Sinatra
Organized rhyme in effect
Snap that neck, like E-Double if there be trouble
So, move on, there's nothing to see here
Clear the area
Your rhymes are dead, get the barrier
To bury ya I'm very effective, I might add
Original rude, since I was a little lad

(Chorus: I neva go back, I neva flow wack
I just come back, I just come phat) x2

Verse 2:

I'm pumpin' like Donovan plus
I'm a little vicious
I eat emcees cause they delicious
It's just that some mistrust but I dust rhymes like a maid
Now I'm back with How
Stompin' like a parade, all up and down Fifth Ave
So you riff have plenty of back, cause I attack, like blood cells
Fighting off diseased emcees
Like Super Friends, in a metropolis, in a super Benz
With Howie, now we got two threes
Fuck it, six, gimme the mix, and I'm a kill 'em with the lyrics
So dig a plot, and nigga got, seven
Never doubt, I go all out, salida
You need a map
You need a rap
You need a slap
You need a nap
So take one, because you're tired
I get so phat, I feel wired
But I never sell, or fall, cause I never fell

(Chorus x2)

Verse 3:

I don't beg
I break your leg like a egg
And fry it, try it, and see what happens when I'm rappin'
Shit start
So get smart like Max
Cause cold hard facts prevail
I don't fail, I don't turn pale
But I'm very ill, I'm fatal
I rock rhymes like a cradle
Many days, many ways, let me count 'em
Everybody that I caught, everybody thought
But, but, bu-bu-but, don't stutter
Just say it, shit is butter
Now, don't that feel better?
Get a sweater
Cause it's gettin' colder, every time I hold a
Mic, niggas freeze up, so ease up like, off the scrotum
Cause you wrote 'em, like you know them
So let me show them, real rhyme
Cause I feel I might, start buggin' if you don't back up off the mic
The lyrical war is on, and so I strike

(Chorus x4)

[Intro: Prodigy]
Yeah, sending this one out
To my man Killa B
No doubt indeed
Where that weed?
Nomsayin'? That old real shit

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
There's a war going on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walking with your head down
Scared to look, you shook
‘Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, ‘cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lah, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together, it's like mixing vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', taking my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord forgive me
The Hennesey got me not knowing how to act
I'm falling and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say so it's left a untold fact
Until my death, my goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Hook: Havoc]
Yo, yo, we living this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still living it)
We living this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still living it)
We living this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still living it)
We living this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Verse 2: Havoc]
I'm trapped, in between two worlds, trying to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low the jewels go
But never that, as long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', counting my stacks
No doubt, watching my back and proceed with caution
Five-oh lurking, no time to get lost in the system
Niggas using fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
Illegal world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged
That fucked me up, God
But shit happens for a reason; you find out who's your true peoples when you're upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a 2 to 4 is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, saving those that I can bet with
Pushing a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get
I'm staying in the projects, forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never separate and pull together
When worse comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfucking feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot; fuck looking cute!
I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoying the smell; in the Bridge getting down, it ain't hard to tell, you better realize

[Hook: Mobb Deep]
Yo, yo, we living this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still living it)
We living this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(Thug life, we still living it)
We living this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
(We still living it)
We living this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Prodigy]
Open your eyes and get wise
Look alive, in '95, word up
Hypnotic thug life, get that ass paralyzed
Nomsayin? Mobb Deep and all that

I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like six-foot-nine
So I can get with Leoshi
Cause she don't know me but yo she's really fine
You know I see her all the time everywhere I go
And even in my dreams I can scheme a way to make her mine
Cause I know she's livin phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball
So how am I gonna compete with that?
Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked
And in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls
Who came to watch their men ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls and me I get the hood rats
I tell em ""scat, skittle, scabobble""
Got hit with a bottle
And I been in the hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess it's a shame when you living in a city
That's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came to my senses
Like quick-quick got sick-sick to my stomach
Overcommeth by the thoughts of me and her together
Right? So when I asked her out she said I wasn't her type

I wish I was a little bit taller

I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good,I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a brand-new car
So far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flatAnd do you really wanna know what's really whack?
See I can't even get a date, so, what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With the hood rats you can hold tight
But really though, I 'm a Figaro
When I'm in my car I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
Well, then I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies ""look alive""
Cause it's hard to survive when your living
In a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Makes me say ""my, my, my""

I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller

I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller

[Verse 3]
Hey, I wish I had my way
Cause everyday would be a Friday
And you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck
Then you should know just how I feelCause if you don't want me around
See I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you , what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like that

I wish I was little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good,I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 1]
First things first: I, Poppa, freaks all the honeys
Dummies, Playboy bunnies, those wanting money
Those the ones I like cause they don't get nathan but penetration
Unless it smells like sanitation
Gar-bage, I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb never, Black and ugly as ever
However, I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee-pee when they see me
Navajos creep me in they teepee
As I lay down laws like Island Carpet
Stop it - if you think they gonna make a profit
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns, get it?
Now tell your friends Poppa hit it, then split it
In two as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A
I don't know what the hell is stopping ya
I'm clocking ya, Versace shades watching ya
Once ya grin, I'm in - game begins
First I talk about how I dress in this
Diamond necklaces, stretch Lexuses
The sex is just immaculate from the back, I get
Deeper and deeper, help you reach the
Climax that your man can't make
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late
And sing the break

[The Break: Faith Evans & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Baby, here I am
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
All, I need is one more chance! One more chance
I can help you find, yourself
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Cause you, don't need nobody else!
One more chance

[Verse 2]
She's sick of that song on how it's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is, Major Payne like Damon Wayans
Low Down Dirty, even, like his brother Keenan
Schemin', don't leave your girl around me!
True player for real, ask Puff Daddy
You ringing bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell
She beeped me meet me at twelve
Where you at? Flipping jobs, paying car notes?
While I'm swimming in your women like the breast stroke
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke - tongue all down her throat
Nothing left to do but send her home to you
I'm through can you sing the song for me boo

[The Song]

[Verse 3]
So what's it gonna be? Him or me?
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crushed linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in em
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin'
High fashion - flying into all states
Sexing me while your man masturbates
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only a client, I'm the player President

[Intro]
I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

[Verse 1]
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dying breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me
I'm not living in the past, you wanna last?
Be the first to blast Remember Kato
No longer with us; he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

[Refrain]
I!, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
Lord!, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm struggling in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm having visions
Of leaving here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm going blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't living well
I know my destiny is Hell Where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears

[Refrain]
Lord!, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
Lord!, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

[Verse 3]
Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
To embrace an early death, now there's nothing left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons trying to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparking the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Painting a picture of my enemies killing me, in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the mornin' to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come

[Refrain]
Lord! (God!), I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears...
God!, I lost so many peers

[Verse 4]
And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, getting high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wanting babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearing noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in
To Heaven's door -- Shed so many tears

[Refrain]
Lord!, lost so many peers, and shed so many tears..
I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears..
Lord!, I suffered many years, and shed so many tears..
God!, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

[Hook: Miss Jones]
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill
(It’s so lovely, so lovely)
AZ’s for real
(Oh he’s for real)
He’s for real
(It’s so lovely sipping on bubbly)

[Verse 1: AZ]
At times I window watch out the Mariott
Zoning on owning co-ops, foreign drop top coupes, and yachts
Guzzling straight shots of scotch
Formulating up plots to escape from 'Salem's Lot
Cause it's scorching hot, making it hard trying to figure who's out to trap me
Pataki, got all kinds of undercovers coming at me
Perhaps he, won't be happy, 'til they snatch me
And place me where half us blacks be
Sitting in Coxsackie, but never me, see, my destiny's to be forever free
In ecstacy, on a hill that awaits for me
So plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough to make living this a must, plus this is real

[Hook: Miss Jones]

[AZ in background]
Ayo son, pull the shades down and let's count this money
Put the Grants in the safe, cause we spending the Jackson's
The Washington's go to wifey, you know how we do

[Verse 2: AZ]
No more cutting grams, and wrapping grands up in rubber bands
I'm a recovered man, our plan's to discover other lands
Suburban places got me seeking for oasis
Cristal by the cases, ladies of all races with dime faces
Sex on the white sand beaches of Saint Thomas
Though this ain't promised, I'm as determined as them old timers
I want a villa in a Costa Rica
So I can smoke my reefer and enjoy how life supposed ta' treat ya'
Laid in the shades of the everglades, finally forever paid
Wearing the finest fabrics tailors ever made
Me and my team, Carribean cuisine
I guess being down for so long I'm all in store to see my dreams

[Hook: Miss Jones]

[Verse 3: AZ]
So until I see past the green pasture, me being supreme master
Ain't much more life to fiend after, but another chapter
A new way of life to adapt to, cause these streets'll gas ya'
And have ya' caught up in the rapture
Déjà vu, I could vision my killa crew more hospitable, consciously aware plus political
Cause though they claim that every man's created equal
Us as native people, find it harder for nights to sleep through
But once established we eating lovely, living lavish, like the house of Versailles, Paris
I gotta have this, it's so plush, just to visualize is like a coke rush
Vivid enough, to make living this a must, plus this is real

[Hook: Miss Jones]

[Outro: Miss Jones]
It's so crazy, I'm down wit' AZ
It's so lovely sippin' on bubbly
It's so crazy, Jones and AZ
It's so lovely sippin' on bubbly
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby
I wanna chill, I wanna chill
I wanna chill on Sugar Hill baby

Look in here, everybody in the house, havin' a ball

Ill Town, Ill Town, ain't got nuttin to prove
Wake up every mornin with my boom box blastin'
It's you that I'm askin'
""What the hell's been happenin""
What once was a fad
Blew up and goin mad
Bart Simpson, even with it
Dropped a single with his dad
This is dedicated to the Hip Hop artist
Those who rock hardest
They're stuck in regardless
When the radio didn't want to play
What we had to say
Now things have changed
Just like a new day

Hey alright, right, right

Now who smoke more blunts than a little bit?
What are you a idiot?
Listen to the lyrics I spit like M1's
Got mad guns up in the cabin
Cause Cease ain't the one for the dibbin and dabbin shit
I make it happen, you got your ass caught
All you saw was fire, from the Honda Passport
Or the M.P., what if you see, then I miss ya
I blow up spots like little sisters
G'wan grit ya teeth, g'wan bite ya nails to the cuticles
Like Murray, my killings be the most beautiful
Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique thick like Luke dancers
Niggas grab your gats, bitches take a glance at
The little one, pullin over in the Land Rover
Playin Big Willie style with a chaffeur, yaknahmean?
Stack the green, read all between the lines
A nigga act up, makes the bastard hard to find

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
(How ya livin Biggie Smalls?) I'm surrounded by criminals
Heavy rollers even the sheisty individuals
Smokin skunk and mad Phillies
Beatin down Billy Badasses, cracks in stacks and masses
If robbery's a class, bet I pass it
Shit get drastic, I'm buryin ya bastards
Big Poppa never softenin
Take you to the church, rob the preacher for the offerin
Leave the fucker coughin up blood, and his pockets like rabbit ears
Covet the wife, Kleenex for the kid's tears
Versace wear, Moschino on my bitches
She whippin my ride, countin my one's, thinkin I'm richest
Just the way players play, all day everyday
I don't know what else to say
I've been robbin niggas since Run and them was singin 'Here We Go'
Snatchin ropes at the Roxie homeboy you didn't know
My flow, detrimental to your health
Usually roll for self, I have son ridin shotgun
My mind's my nine, my pen's my Mac-10
My target, all you wack niggas who started rappin
Junior M.A.F.I.A. steelo, niggas know the half
Caviar for breakfast, champagne bubble baths
Runnin up in pretty bitches constantly
The Smalls bitch, who the fuck it was supposed to be?

I used to pack Macs in Cadillacs
Now I pimp gats in the Ac's, watch my niggas backs
Nines in the stores, Glocks in the bags
Maxin mini-markets, gettin money with the Arabs
No question, confession, yes it's the lyrical
Bitches squeeze your tits, niggas grab your genitals
Proteins and minerals, excluse subliminals
Big Momma shoots the game to all you Willies and criminals
I kick the rilli with my peeps all day
325's roll by with the windows down halfway
D-K-N-Y, oh my, I'm jiggy
It's all about the Smalls and my fuckin nigga Biggie
Bitches love the way I bust a rhyme
Cause they all in line screamin one more time
Niggas, grab your dicks if you love hip-hop
Bitches rub-a-dub in the back of the club, straight up

[Intro]
There was three little piggies and they all went to the market
And two short motherfuckas, hahaha
Chopped them down, because, uh
One little short motherfucka was born into greatness
Has obtained greatness, because his name is uh

Bushwick, aka Chuck, four foot eight and straight don't give a fuck
I got the strength of six men
With the heart to run up on a muthafucka six ten
I swear, I knows no fear, this labels me a threat
Throats get cut, niggas chests get wet
Some people say I got a short complex, that ain't true
But I got a short fuse so what's next?
Now we could go toe to toe or shoulder to nut
Either way it goes your getting fucked
Cause you trip and try to size me
And that type of shit just inspires me
I don't need no muthafuckin strap
We could get it on cause I feel I got a (?????)
Now you could fuck me up and I'mma still squab
Peelin' more caps than the motherfuckin mob

Chorus X3
Who the biggest, little motherfucker you know?
You the biggest, little motherfucka I know

I'm the biggest, little motherfucka you know
You the biggest, little motherfucker I know

Some ho nigga tried to play me out the box
[Now what you do that for?]
Now I got to knock your ass out
With the one, two jump to the chin
I'll wake your ass up and then knock your ass out again
That's what you get for tryin to test the Chuck black
A back full of dirt and my foot in your ass trick
I can't stand a muthafucka fulla talk
You pull his ho cord and he can't walk the walk
Don't let your eyes get bigger than your squabble
Thinkin' cause I'm small nigga, you can make me wobble
I got a punch as big as Streisands nose
Running motherfuckas like some panty hose
Shit, it takes two to tango
But one to get his ass kicked
Now I can get in that ass trick
Hitting motherfuckas up, Houston style
5th Ward motherfucker how you like me now?

Chorus X4

Now I'm eeny meeny miny fuckin mo
It seems nobody wants to fuck wit Chuck NO MOE!
Ever since I put the weight down
Ever sonce I broke a niggas jaw
Don't nobody wanna play now
First it was all good, and you were smilin
Until I broke your two front teeth, and now your whinin
I told you motherfuckas size ain't shit
I only wear size 5's but I still kick dents
You talk shit and I'mma beat that ass
You come weak and I'mma beat that ass
You play me cheap and I'mma beat that ass
And if cheatin bring ya heat then I'mma heat that ass trick
Don't ever underestimate a nigga with a giant size heart
And king size trigga finger
And don't ever fuck wit Wick
Cause I'm the biggest little motherfucka you know trick

Chorus X4

Aiyyo spark up the phillies and pass the stout
Make it quick money grip or your ass is out
In a street brawl, I strike men quicker than lightning
You seen what happened in my last fight friend, aight then
L's a clever threat, a lyricist who never sweat
Comparing yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolette
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah cause I got all of them sprung Jack
My girls are like boomerangs
No matter how far I throw them they come back
I'm coming straight out the N.Y.C
I'm down with Diggin In The Crates and I'm MVP

If rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
Yo if rap was a game I'll be M.V.P

Yo it's a must that I get papes
Peace to all the DJ's who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again the man's back with a dance track
So here's your chance Jack to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like Boku, mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And everytime I'm jammed I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flying saucers
No more iron horses cause I'm buying Porsches
Coming straight out the NYC
Peace to the Kid Capri, I'm MVP

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Battles I lose none, I make crews run
I get fools done, got ten fingers but only use one
I run up like Machine Gun Kelly with a black skully
Put one in your belly, leave you smelly, then take your Pelle Pelle
I'm the neighborhood lamper, punani vamper
Mess around you'll find my silk boxers in your Mommy's hamper
And nowadays girls want you for your money
I'm like Hev, I got nothing but love for you honey
And since I'm looking slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my ___
I'm coming straight out the NYC
Rap's my J-O-B, and I'm MVP

That's who I runs wit

Pack your bags, head outta town

From Jamaica comes a nigga named Cheeks
With techniques of the streets
Over rough neck beats
This room is going bounce about the Cheeks can't remember
I'm the muthafucker choppin' crews like a chainsaw
Talk what you what ta
Do what you gotta
Well let me tell you something man you can't do me nadda

Chorus

Outro
Now if you listen to my album, you see we only deal
Wit the real deal street life

Wake up, wake up, wake up

So cash your checks and come up

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
Hey, my niggas, we havin' a wonderful day
And I won't front with ya, why?
'Cause it's the 1st of the month
And now we smokin', jokin', rollin' blunts
And sippin' on 40 ounces, thuggin'
Come, come, we've got the blunts and rum
From jumpin' all nights we high
Hit up the block to where? East 99
I get with my nigga to get me some yayo
Double up, ""Nigga, what you need?
We got weed to get P.O.D.'ed, fiend for the green leaves.""
Give it up, it's the info, so you better lay low
'Cause the popo creep when they roll slow
If you can't get away, better toss that yayo, keep your bankroll
Yeah, we havin' a celebration, I love to stay high
And you better believe when it's time to grind
I'm down for mine, crime after crime
Fin to creep to the pad, 'cause Mom's got grub on the grill
And we got the 4-0, you know it's the 1st of the month
And, my nigga, we chills for real

[Hook: Layzie Bone and Bizzy Bone]
Wake up, wake up, wake up
It's the 1st of the month

[Verse 2: Bizzy Bone]
Wake up, and I see that my sister was already dressed
She said: ""I'ma run and go get my stamps
Watch and make sure no one snatches my check.""
Nigga, that's the mailman
Sort through the mail and put it up into me pocket
So I be hittin' the 99 to get me a dub for 40 bucks
But ain't no bucket ride that RTA, hop on the 10 to the Clair
Ready to get 'em up with-a me thugs
And to cash that dum, man, I gotta get paid
Playa, playa, holla, holla, Saint Clair got much to offer
Whether it be weed on 93
Or off on the Glock-Glock for some dollars
So, get a bag of dope and a quarter O
Oh, most all of my niggas got the same
And we gonna roll it all up to smoke
Hittin' that reefer hydro, you know the cut, so fuck them popo
Toss all that yayo, and we're gonna say ""no""
Runnin' through the alley and into the mally
Up on the second the Sun down
Those run from January on down to December
I'm lovin' the 1st of the month

[Hook: Layzie Bone and Bizzy Bone]
Wake up, wake up, wake up

So get up, get up, get up

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
Gotta grind, gotta get mine, in the hood that I claim
And I slang on that double 9-9
Gotta find them dubs
Gonna get a 40, can a thug get love?
What's up? Try to slang on my corner
Nigga, you's a goner: Saint Clair niggas don't like that
And sellin' them dummies, makin' that money
Come back, nigga, get pap pap
From the 1st to the 15th niggas smoke plenty weed
But I gotta save, gotta come up
Put my rocks on the cut
When I get high, nigga, blaze that blunt, huh
Time to roll to the pad
Count up my profits and add it to the stash
Gotta watch my back
See for niggas that's tryin' to rob me, fool
But never no shorts or no losses
Dumpin', keepin' these niggas up off me
See, gotta search the whole block
Spend a couple of bills, thugs smoke a lot of weed on the 1st

[Hook: Layzie Bone and Bizzy Bone]
Wake up, wake up, wake up

So get up, get up, get up
So cash your checks and come up

[Verse 4: Layzie Bone + (Krayzie Bone)]
Wakin' up, feelin' buzzed, up early mornin'
Stretchin', I'm yawnin', lightweight, bent
Chugga-lugga take a 5th to the dome
Instead I kick it with my trues
But it's the 1st, so I'm gettin' me hustle on
Hop on the phone, callin' up Krayzie Bone
Wanna know, did your O.G. check come? (Sure, put me down!)
I'ma hop on the bus with Biz (Yo, Brother, let's get drunk!)
And I'm comin' with blunt after blunt of this skunk
Nigga T just put me down
Oh God, how I love when the 1st come around
Now I'm freakin' me Black n Mild, headed cross town
'Cause niggas, the 1st get celebrated
Rushin' to the block 'cause I wanna get faded
Lookin' all wild 'cause I'm gettin' me hair braided
We heavy off into this game
True to the 1st, just call me that pro slang
Them nickels and dimes and 20's and 50's
The 1st be the day for the dopeman
Slangin' that cocaine, fool, and I'm workin' late tonight
And all them fiends be lovin' them thugs
'Cause I got them rocks for them pipes
Come, come with-a ease
I gotta get paid on the 1st, gotta blaze up my spliff
Get live with the Bone Thugs
Poetic Hustlaz, and the Graveyard Shift, on the 1st

[Hook: Layzie Bone and Bizzy Bone]
Wake up, wake up, wake up

So get up, get up, get up
So cash your checks and come up

787,7643,KRS-One,MC's Act Like They Don't Know,19,1995-09-09,"

[Intro]
Clap your hands everybody, if you got what it takes
Cos I'm KRS and I'm on the mic, and Premier's on The Breaks

[Verse 1]
If you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy, I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper, girls go, ""Ill""
Check the time as I rhyme, it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, as I leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or knotty dreads
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember You Must Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player
But make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer

[Verse 2]
This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it

[Verse 3]
Some MC's don't like the KRS but they must respect him
Cos they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
Just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew, they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tango with the likes of these
Cross your t's and dot your i's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like Artifacts
On the Wrong Side of Da Tracks, electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
As I spark mad izm
The 1996 lyrical style's what I give 'em

[Verse 2: ]
Uhh, One time for yo mind

So say yes I'll bust your caliber

I hope he got more miracles than Smokey
Won't be no discussion, strictly head crushing
Lead rushin trough your body
You're in my Dangerfield like Rodney
Howdy i'll back up in that ass G kaplowie
And now we got the game to a T like Howie
Allow me, to introduce myself and my peeps
Straight from the sewer
Stayin true to the streets

[Verse 4: ]
Well it's me crazy Drazy, bringin up the rear
I swear, we got to Hold It Down here yeah
So there, let me crack a brew and kick my feet up
Turn the heat up and smiggedy-smoke all the weed up
Kids I beat up/wit my style that's the newest
My crew is, getting more run than Carl Lewis
It's from the sewer now ya see me on the top
So stop and recognize the niggas on ya block

To the hiddip the hop it don't stop (don't stop)
Das EFX with the real hip hop (hip hop)
To the hiddip the hop it don't quit (don't quit)
Das EFX and we came to rip shit (rip shit)

[Verse 5: ]
A-Yo Mc's is irrelevant, and delicate to the texture
But this style of mine is well defined like Webster
Ain’t a better nigga raw from the jaw and the jabber-jibber
When I get Stone like Sharon from Sliver
Equipped to riggedy rip the microphone to shreds
Dread yo come and hit these niggas in the head

[Verse 6: ]
Well I connect my rhymes like Lego so lego my eggo
I burn ya like Waco, you need more than Maaco
I take it to ya crew and keep em moving like Im Uhaul
Im here to school yall, figgedy faggots like Rupaul
I throw a screwball and strike out the MC
And if he temps me, I knock em out like Jack Dempsey
I burn some sensi and chase em wit the Guiness
The illest, now hit me with the hook because I'm finished

[Hook]
To the hiddip the hop it don't stop (don't stop)

794,7692,WC & The Maad Circle,West Up!,18,1995-09-23,"

Intro: WC

Wessyyrr-fa-liv-ni-ya!!
(""Throwin up the W"" -- Ice Cube) 2X
Yeah, I'm with this, what we throwin up?
(""Throwin up the W"" -- Ice Cube)
All you busta ass niggas out there

I got my motherfuckin homeboys in the house (""Throwin up the W"")
My nigga Ice Cube (""Throwin up the W""), Mack 10
Back to set the record straight for all these busta ass niggas
Who trip, this how we do it nigga

[Chorus: WC]
Front back side to side
We be givin it up, till the day we die
Niggas hit me up, I'mma have ta erupt
So motherfucker West Up!
(repeat 2X)

[Verse One: WC]
Nigga clear the lane, here I come, once again
With this, gangsta click, droppin this, gangsta shit
Strictly for the riders who ride us I gotta WestSider
Rhymer for them niggas that's sittin on them Dayton wires
Pump the bass, hit the switch
Cause Ice Cube, Mack 10, and Dub-C, back up in this b-i-itch
Straight hoodsta for life, ain't no lookin back
Ink in my flesh, WestSide tattoed on my chest
Walkin with the shadow of death
Through the land of the skanless, South Central Los Angeles
Home of the Crips and the Bloods
Where even the strongest niggas is drug through the mud
And visitors from outta town best to stay in Hollywood
You get that tourist ass ganked strollin through my hood
West coast till the casket drop
I be throwin it up, so motherfucker West Up!

[Verse Two: Mack 10]
It's gun ho Mack one-0 please you can't fuck wit deez
Ice Cubez and Dub-Ceez is my G'z
And hip-hop, top three niggas the new bosses
Never slippin cause we flosses, packin Nina Rosses
Nigga, thought You Knew How We Do It
Ain't a Damn Thing Changed, always On Them Thangs
Forever and a day, so back up, gimme room, don't neglect
Just respect and everything I can't check I wreck
Now you can cross out the bustas and snitches
Shit only killers, hoochie bitches and hot hydraulic switches allowed
On the turf where the real hogs dwell
Sewed up the hood, the fattest boulders on the block for sale
Inglewood City, the throne I call home
Niggas be so bright, you might need your locs on
To bell through, it's fin you're in with Mack 10
And I gotta confess up, nigga this West Up! for life

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Ice Cube]
Now I got ta show you how the West coast rocks
No razor blades in my mouth, just a Glock
And I'm hittin you up, with that W-S
The sun rises in the East, but it sets in the West
No gold teeth, you gets a wreath
So hand me the goodies, stockin mask, no hoodies
Christmas day, I'm in a tre
While some of you niggas got the robe reindeer and a sleigh
We don't call it five-oh, we call it one time
It's my life my life my life my life, in the sunshine!
One nine weighs a ton
How the fuck you think that the West was won?
Now shit can be squashed over a forty ounce of backwash
No jokes, the land of locs and hundred spokes
In the East, we can be brothers
But when you come to L.A., watch your motherfuckin colors
West Up! nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse Four: WC]
Give it up, give it up
Like the nigga James Brown, me and my niggas are puttin it down
So bustas be wary cause see we represent the city
Where niggas caught slippin is left with they brains drippin
City of the Angels, more like a concrete jungle
Full of macks Cadillacs and crack sacks
I pledge allegiance to the shit till I die
[Mack 10] So let the five-twenty slide and put it down from the WestSide

[Chorus]
WestSide!!!
(""Throwin up the W"")

[Intro]
To the beat y'all.. to the beat y'all
""I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch"" - Notorious B.I.G

[Verse One]
See I done chalked up another one when I drop a ton
Take yo' favorite MC and bring the light like the sun
Get done! Bow down I be the one known to rock rhymes
With lines beyond yours to make it prime time
I'm the master, of the ceremony Mally G
It'll be a long day before you see another me
I be, higher than clouds, with the system pumpin loud
Trippin lovin life, it's the illest juvenile
Wit my nigga Red, runnin up in
Your spot wit enough dick for you and a friend
Some killer ass weed, for those who huff
It make you wanna kill a nigga after takin one puff of the stuff
Shit is tough, but all stress
Chased away by the Tanqueray murder in my way
+Heyyy, Young World+, peep my method of madness
Watch it bring sadness because it's that thorough
It's me against the world

[Hook One: repeat 2X]
Now who the fuck wanna see Jamal, I fades em all
""I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch""

[Verse Two]
I gets mad wreck when wreck is the concept
Stickin tecs to fake niggas necks when they flex
For those that don't know about my flows let me introduce
I'm anti truce plus pack a deuce deuce
I'm 5 feet 5 inches, I serve the best of the lyricsts
I come swift, Def Squad soloist
I be one of the illest, realest, gettin busy shorties
Rollin wit Reggie smokin blunts and drinkin 40's
I'm rippin niggas out the frame with information
When I unleash shit I dust em off like creamation
If it's on it's on nigga (say word bond)
Word bond on my momma and his, and his kids!
I represent the East where niggas ill, fuck peace!
All the shit you talkin nigga that will get yo' ass deceased
Murder; haven't you heard of what I be droppin?
Cause when I drop my ill style my style be poppin
Like corn, word is bond, it's on again
I wet 'em up till them fess up, with the mac to they chiin
It's the black Mac 10 I never rome with chrome
When I do my ill shit I only represent my home
It's P-H-I double the L, Y
When I'm in New Jersey, North 18th, hittin up Double I
Now sigh in relief cause y'all can't see me
I be the looniest little ass MC, now
When I drop my format I mak yo brains go splat
From what I pack niggas gots to react

[Hook Two: repeat 2X]
Now who the fuck wanna see Jamal, I fades em all
""I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch""
Now who the fuck wanna see Jamal, I fades em all
""Now I got a Glock, makin motherfuckers duck"" - B.I.G

[Verse Three]
Comin from the Squad of Def, never left stranded
All is demanded when the Glock nine is handed
Bandit when Green Eye, pack heat
Still keepin it real, maintain to keep it street
Peep, the way I sweep MC's up off they feet
Irritatin like whack rhymes on funk beats
Your shit is obsolete, I speak, and crush when I bust
Upon niggas with the gun like track meets to make em run
Now who the fuck wanna see Jamal, I fades em all
And when I rock that shot, MC's is sure to fall
You shouldn't have went there, nigga
You gotta come quicker and slicker I'm known to twist a Mr
Now is you wit me? (With who?) Jamal
Got the girlies hangin from the balls 'til I dick up in they drawers
I got shit covered like plaster, comin massively
Back steps for more wreck and let bitches get passed to me

Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy

[Intro: 2Pac]
Yo Mo Bee mayn!, drop that shit!
You know what time, boo-yaow, I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand you know what I'm sayin'
And uhh, throw up that finger
Ayo throw y'all fingers up! Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Tell me baby are you lonely?
Don't wanna rush ya, I can help ya if ya only
Let me touch ya, If I'm wrong love tell me
'cause I get caught up, and the life I live is Hell see
I never thought I'd see, the day when I would calm down
You ain't heard, I've been known to clown and Get Around
That's my word, see you walkin' and you lookin' good
Yes indeed, got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
With your attitude to match right?
Don't be phony, 'cause I hate when you act like
You don't know me I've be stressin' in the spotlight
I want the fame, but the industry's a lot like
A crap game, ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be with you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
(Look here) I wanna be an honest man
But temptations go

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Throw up the finger! And all my homies go
Throw them the finger! Ya know what baby it's like

[Hook: Easy Mo Bee]
I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you needed, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Will I cheat or will I be committed, Heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in
Gettin' high, I can hear the people callin'
I'm passin' by, everybody knows I'm ballin'
And to God, gotta keep myself from fall-in
But it's hard, all the cuties know I'm under pressure
What do I do, gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up
And say it's cool, should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper
Some dirty words In your ears as I kiss ya
On every curve, slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Give 'em the finger!
All my homies go, throw your fingers up
That's just the Thug in me girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like

[Hook: Easy Mo Bee]
I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you needed, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
A lotta people think it's easy
To settle down, got a woman that'll please me
In every town, I don't wanna but I gotta do it
The temptation got me ready to release the fluid Sensation, sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
'Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin'
See you later, 'cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was

[Interlude: 2Pac]
Give 'em the finger, and all my homies go
Yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know?
Throw your fingers up
You know? They gonna peep this, this how we run game on you

(Everybody, heyy, alright

Face cause bitch the man right here
You nigga didn't think that I could swing mine
Bitch I'm doing bad and saying rhymes at the same time (I ain't lying)
Talking behind my back don't make me no nevermind
Cause all you can say is I'm smarter than Einstein
I'm fire like Cayenne!
You'll never catch me cause I'm swift as a hyena
Gimme the chance I'll rock the Lakefront Arena
Like Teena Marie be rockin' Tipitina's (damn Gina)
Tall dark strong long and lean ain't nobody comin cleaner
It's all in the way I lay my game down
Watch me swing with the Guillotine, rollin' round Niggatown
But everybody think these niggas be wantin' me
To prove that I'm the man
Bitch I'm colder than a freezer, cooler than a fan
I got no love for no b-i-e-otch
Matter fact's been that way since I was wearin' osh kosh b'gosh
But yet y'all steadily trying to squab bout me
When I come in this door the only thing y'all can do is talk about me
Better get some business about yourself that's what you better do
Matter fact I'm a tell you mother fuckers three things I'm a never do
One : never gonna change my style
Two: never gonna bounce, three: never gonna bow
I'm gettin' tired of being sick and tired
Nigga you got a problem with me gettin' high
Suck big dick and die
Same rhyme phrase get me paid, they can't fade
The tan shade man with the braids
Bitches peep as I creep through the 12th ward
I done offended these niggas compare me
To niggas that gotta practice looking hard
Bitch-a won't leave me alone
I'm not that Thug and I'm not that Ruggish but I do pack Bone
Black prince of the south that's my title
Bitch I'm whoo chka ckha ow! bad like Michael
I'm throwin rhymes at a steady flow
Whoo, there they go y'all niggas ain't ready yo

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bitch I pimp hoes instead of an army petty shit it don't harm me
Bitch I'm entertaining like Cedric and I'm mac like Bernie
I'm black like Menace and I'm g like Slimm
I'm Sporty like T and I'm smooth like Tim
I can click just like the boot camp but I'm conscious like daughter
Bitch I'm insane but um, you still be wantin'
To claim that I'm your partner
I'm Down just like Bust plus I'm Ice just like Mike
And I'm the living lyrical miracle I'm just ice like Precise
I'm the invisible man you blind you can't see shit
You mad cause I got more bitches on my dick than bitches at Freaknik
I'm rougher than a Brillo, I'm soothing like Mylanta
And I'm kickin' like Brando, and I'm swingin' like Evander
Technics that'll speak, be sweet like my Auntie Alberta
Who got the nerve to fuck with the murderer
Better not be no busta
Kickin' it with them Uptown, levee-born hustlers
Ain't no slack in my stack, ain't no lack in my mack
I'ma put you on yo back cause you'se a rat
I'm no pussycat
I cock enough dick to make you scream Hallelujah
Runnin' these bitches from Tchoupitoulas through Pascagoula to Chattanooga
I'm the nigga gon' rock ""Streamline"" like Lalapalooza
You think you gon' take me, but fuck that
Bitch, I'm out that Boot Camp Click
I got my rifle and my rucksack
Never ever [??] could touch this lil nigga
Cise, break it down
Dave, play that fuckin' guitar
I run wit' the best and I'm willin' to bet that
He done dropped that album on that ass
But, y'all niggas ain't ready yet

[Verse 1: Khujo]
When the scene unfolds
Young girls 13 years old
Expose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank
Got more stretch marks than these hoes
Hollin they got rank
See Sega ain't in this new world order
Dem experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas
They trained assassins to do search and seize
Ain't knocking or asking
Dem coming for niggas like me
Po' white trash, like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps lace with gas pipes lines
Inferno's outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me later on
In the future look it up
Where they say it? Ain't no more Constitution
In the event of a race war
Places like operation heartbreak hotel
Moments tear until air tight vents seat off despair
Dem say expect no mercy
Fool you should be my least worries got to deal with
Where my W-2's, 1099's
Unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines

[Hook]
Who's that peeking in my window?
POW nobody now

[Verse 2: CeeLo Green]
Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with the serial code was put up next
The claim that this community is so drug free
But it don't look that way to me cause I can see
The young bloods hanging out at the sto 24/7
Junkies looking, for a hit of the blow, it's powerful
Oh you know what else they tryin to do
Make a curfew especially for me and you the
Traces of the new world order
Time is getting shorter if we don't get prepared
People it's gone be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious

But every now and then, I wonder
If the gate was put up to keep crime out or to
Keep our ass in

[Hook]
Who's that peeking in my window?
POW nobody now

[Verse 3: T-Mo]
Listen up little niggas I'm talking to you
About what yo little ass need to be going through
I fall a victim too and I know I shouldn't smoke so much
But I do with the crew everybody on the average 'bout 4 or 5
I'm lucky to be alive at sunrise now I realize the cost
After I lost my best friend Bean I recognize as a King
Who am I to tell you to stop smokin
Now you're open to disease and colds
And ain't 16 years old, this shit has got to stop
Let's take a walk through detox
I want outta this hole I'm in a cell under attack
Loc up folks they in the hood, got an eye on every move
I make open your face to info you ain't know
Cause it's kept low how the new world plan
Reeks the planet without the black man

[Verse 4: Big Gipp]
So what's your angle?
Try to separate me from the blood
Is disrespect like coming in my home and not
Wiping your feet on tha rug
The Citron Absolut has got me bucking no hang
With no phony
Lookout for the man with tha mask
On the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes
Always on my heels
Insane, plain soldiers coming in the dark by plane
To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip
Run your hand over tha scanner to buy you dish now
No more fishing for your fish
Kiss tha days of tha old days past ways gone
Mind blown, conception, protection
My name on your selections but I caught you
Coming POW!

Intro:

I'll just sway...
This's the way it goes down
Def Squad
Nine-pound
Check this here

Verse One:

The E gets wicked, no need for the biscuit
The green-eyed funkdafied brother coming wicked
I sets the party off just like Tanqueray
The Funk Lord, nobody else could swing this way
I put the loc to the motion, drop the funk coast to coast and
I Buck like Shot, cuz I know I Got Cha Opin
Check the soup, I Dogg the mic like Snoop
I get swift like H-Town, when I Knock Da Boots (daaat's right)
I'm dynamite with this mic
I Show like Doug E. and I rock the mic lovely
The afrodesiac, bringin the do-wah-diddy
To your city, on the Zapp side with the vibe
I'm Stone Cold like Bobby and Ralph T
I come with the Game of Death, without Bruce Lee
The irregular speakin, for those MC's who be tweakin
Catch me at the Beacon just freakin

Chorus:

Brothers can't see me                                \
Cuz my style's the bom-digi-bom-uh-dang-a-dang-digi  / repeat 2X
...
Brothers can't see me

Verse Two:

It goes one for the trouble, two for the show
Aiyyo, I'm gettin airplay like The Most Beautiful
I'm the mack, I made Goldy turn chrome
When I induce my styles upon the microphone (yeah)
I goes down for y'all in broad daylight
Weeded, rockin the mic like ta-dow and psych
Today is a Green Day, so it's blazin
To specify it, I get big-up from Jamaicans
Hey, the E-R-I-C-K gets down for the public
More doper than Janet Jackson's stomach
Ask anybody, who's the dopest producer?
I think of cruise, I'm never too much like I'm Luther
My style is the craziest
No crew is fadin us
You got beef with my squad you better dare that
The shit I kick make rappers say, ""I should've said that""

Chorus

Verse Three:

Complete this puzzle, what Squad be Def like Russell Simmons
And more flyer than Robin Givens
Cosmic Slop, from the darkside
Basically, I Can't Wait, songs from the Redman tape
(and make much sense when he's kickin fool) cause I constantly keep shitting
And y'all constantly keep listening
Yeah, who can it be now, watch out
Flying through the air with wings E Double doing my thing

Chorus

"
805,7790,Salt-N-Pepa,Ain't Nothin' But A She Thing,16,1995-10-21,"

It ain't a man's world (You go, girl!)
No more sugar and spice (And everything nice)
(repeat)

[Hook:]
It's a she thing, and it's all in me
I could be anything that I want to be
Don't consider me a minority
Open up your eyes and maybe you'll see
It's a she thing, and it's all in me
I could be anything that I want to be
Don't consider me a minority
Ladies help me out if you agree

It ain't nuthin' but a she thing (We are proud)
It ain't nuthin' but a she thing (Say it loud)
It ain't nuthin' but a she thing (On the rise)
It ain't nuthin' but a she thing (Better recognize)

Now I can bring home the bacon (yeah), fry it in the pan (yeah)
Never let you forget that you're a man
Cuz I'm a W-O-M-A-N
That's what I am, doin' all I can
The thing that makes me mad and crazy, upset
Got to break my neck just to get my respect
Go to work and get paid less than a man
When I'm doin' the same damn thing that he can
When I'm aggressive then I'm a bitch
When I got attitude you call me a witch
Treat me like a sex-object (That ain't smooth)
Underestimate the mind, oh yeah, you're a fool
Weaker sex, yeah, right, that's the joke (ha!)
Have you ever been in labor? I don't think so, nope
I'm a genuine feminine female thang
Can you hang? Ain't nothin' but a she thang

[Hook]

It ain't nothin' but a she thing (We are proud)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (Say it loud)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (On the rise)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (You better recognize)

On the real I'm a female doin' what I feel
Put me to the test, yes, I will get ill
Sensitive and sweet, yeah, all that good stuff
But when it's time to get rough, baby, I'm rough enough
Ain't afraid to show how I feel down deep
Compassisionate but don't underestimate me
I'm intelligent, wise, complicated being
With an instinct to dream and believe in the dreams
Family's first before anybody else (believe that)
Take care of them before I take care of self
I'm a genuine feminine female thang
Can you hang? Ain't nothin' but a she thang

It ain't nothin' but a she thing (We are proud)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (Say it loud)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (On the rise)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (You better recognize)

You got to understand it's a she thang
We got the power, yeah, you know the deal
So you go, girl (You go, girl!), it ain't no man's world
You can do anything (You can do anything), do what you feel

Excuse me, hold up...(Pep got the floor!)
I'm givin' props to the strong women layin' down the law
Taking control of the wrongs in their life (hey)
Standing up and turning all the wrongs to the right (ho)
I'd like to give a shout out to the mamas out there (Shout it out)
Bringing up the babies with the tender loving care
You're in charge of the future of the nation
Do the right thing, lay the foundation
To all the single mothers Salt-N-Pepa said, ""Keep your head up""
I know it gets hard sometimes but never let up
You're a genuine feminine female thang
Can you hang? Ain't nothin' but a she thang

[Hook]

It ain't nothin' but a she thing (We are proud)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (Say it loud)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (On the rise)
It ain't nothin' but a she thing (You better recognize)

Now let me break it down to the marrow of the bone
I'm a female (go!), and I got it goin' on (ya know)
Don't be fooled by my S-E-X
It ain't that simple, I'm more complex
We've come a long way, and, baby, that's a fact
Let's keep moving forward, girls, never look back
Fight for your rights, stand up and be heard
You're just as good as any man, believe that, word

[Hook]

And so great is a man goin to be praised
Selassie I liveth everytime
I say Jah shall execute judgment and justice
And none shall escape or get mercy, what me say
Selassie I liveth everytime, what me say

Chorus:

Boy you coulda put on the wings of de morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I
Dwellin in de uttermost depths of the sea
There is no escape from his Majesty

Verse One:

A long time he a tell you bout the dirty slavery
A long time he a tell you bout the brutality
A long time he a tell you bout the H.I.M. prophecied
Me warn you, bout recent monarchy
Me warn you, all bout the black liberty
Me warn you, all bout we equality
Me warn you, all bout Marcus Garvey
Me beg you, have fi love his Majesty
Selassie I, soul that kept me
Selassie I, power a di trinity
And X amount of nation bow down 'pon them knee
No stop from beg, and dem no stop from pleas
And nowhere to run and there is no-where

Chorus

Verse Two: Method Man

Here come that rudebwoy shit, criminology legit
Legalize dope to get me mega-rich Selassie I
We can all get by if we unify
Gettin chinky eye off the stimuli, blazin the cut
And all that good stuff, six-three walk with a strut
On these New York streets like baby what
Anything can happen, it usually does
I'm from Staten, the Island, peep me on G-Street, Ticallion
Everything is real ain't nuttin fronted
Counterfeit rapper haffa bungee
He's in it for the munties, M-O-N-E-Y
But you can't take it witcha when you die, Selassie high

Verse Three: Capleton

If ya open up de wings an tell dem fi exit
Cause no anti-Christ an naw gon worship
Ay Selai for the righteous but di wicked affi perish
With dem religion and dem whole poli-tricks
Half the people dem a turn and half the people dem a twist
Now shoot dem, another ear-trick done perish
Get M some 16 and some rusty-matic
After the whole of them from gone then push up them fists
Leave the ship them a strip, you must get punish
Cyann escape your judgment, stand up oh boy

Chorus

So ahh, and one of these day
When you hear a voice say come
Where you gonna run too, ohhhh woyyyy
I said they gonna run to the rock
And mountain but there will be no rock, no rock
They're gonna run to the rocks
And mountain but there will be no rock, so what we say

Verse Four: Method Man

Wu-Tang Clan's in the area, Capleton's in the area
We got Shaolin in the area
Big up yourself black man, my brothers
Hell is the plan for the other, discover, discover, discover, c'mon, c'mon
New lands for you man and your family
Reminisce on back in the days, can it be
It was all so simple then, we all kin
And black-skinned, original Don set the trend
Let's be men, if not for us, then for the babies
The little ones the revolution has now begun

[Put on put on the wings of the morning and fly
There is no escape from King Selassie I!!]

Outro: Method Man

Now, owwww, everybody
Get in where you fit in
For nine-five, the nine-nickel

[Intro: Sticky Fingaz]
South suicide Queens, all niggas
Gather up all your arms
And get ready for this New World Order
Shit is about to change, motherfucker!

[Verse 1: Fredro Starr]
I’m America’s nightmare
Young, black and just don’t give a fuck
I just wanna get high and live it up
So fuck a 9-to-5! And whitey tryin' to slave us
With minimum wages, slammin' my niggas up in cages
Changin their behavior to spittin' razors, that's outrageous
Smokin' roaches is hopeless
We want lazy sofas and sculptures
Lady chauffeurs who fuck us, full house and royal flushes
Roll with the rush, it's that Afficial Nast
Got bitches with pistols and cash, we livin' in the last
My theory is ""fuck it,"" sexy niggas get abducted
My corrupted is conducted, through ghettos, sippin' Amaretto
Hand on the metal, foot on the pedal, never settle
He wore Carolina Herrera, dirty Donna Karan sweaters
Ralph Lauren leathers and suedes
Gold plated guns and grenades
To blow up; I got news from the informers
I'm trapped in corners, bustin' shots at Time-Warner's

[Verse 2: Sonee Seeza]
My man big Ty, he know how to get by
Get high, do a jix, then be fixed to be fly
Some mid, cross and up and downtown action
And when he stick he keep a grip and move with traction
Keep mad alibis, a plan to stay wise
And wide-eyed, livin' in the state of Southside
Crooked jakes and fakes, snake niggas all out for papes
All who wanna overtake, you leave them with drapes
The white sheet covers, this heat smothers
The street, eat brothers, six shots rang, duke got banged
We all ready for these wars
We all want more, these the last days—get yours!

[Bridge 1: Fredro Starr]
32 shots inserted in Glock's, you heard it for blocks
The murderer who gots convertible drops
Livin' life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it
‘Cause it be off the hook, crooks, crack
Cheeba spots, and sellin' rocks
The cops around the clock, it’s hot
Livin' life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it

[Verse 3: Sticky Fingaz]
Thinkin' about takin' my own life, I might as well
Except they might not sell weed in hell
And that’s where I’m goin', ‘cause the Devil’s inside of me
He make me rob from my own nationality
That’s kind of ignorant, but yo, I gotta pay the rent
So, yeah, I'll stick a nigga most definite
A degenerate, if I get caught I'm innocent
‘Cause I don't leave no sticky fingerprints
For the cops, they only good if they dead
And all that badge and the gun shit be goin’ to their head
To make bread I gotta steal for sport
So I stole the show and made some pennies for my thoughts
And if this fuckin' rap shit don't pay
I'ma start sellin' drugs around my way
Killin' my own people in the USG
Shit, they gonna get it from somebody, I'd rather it be me
Besides, you can't tax dirty money
And you can't trust nobody (Nobody!)
No one (No one!), I'm a scorpion
And I'll probably bite the bullet, ‘cause I live by the gun

[Bridge 2: Fredro Starr]
Big heavy-hitters, 25-to-life bidders who just came out
And pullin' flame out, take aim, blow your brains out
It’s life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it
In South suicide Queens where niggas act up
Nigga, back up, Afficial Nast, throw your fuckin' gats up!
It’s life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it
We never givin' a shit, ‘cause we livin' in it
Afficial Nast motherfuckers don't give a shit—word up!

[Intro: Michael McCary]
I've been watchin' you from afar
For as long as I can remember
You're all a real man can need
And ever ask for
This is love, girl
This is more than a crush
Yeah

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
It was Harlem at the Ruckers
I saw with your man
Smilin', huh, a Coach bag in your hand
I was layin' in the coupe with my hat turned back
We caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
So skated off, as you strolled off
Lookin' at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mission
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
You only knew him 5 months (that's right)
Besides he drink too much and smoke too many blunts
And I be workin' out everyday thinkin' bout you
Looking at my own eyes in the rear view
Cathchin flash backs of our eye contact
Wish I could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
I would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years

[Hook: Boyz II Men]
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
I see you at the bus stop waitin' everyday
Your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
But I don't want ta violate your relationship
So I lay back in the cut with a crush that's a trip
Still he can't stop me from having day dreams
Tonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream
Kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
Searchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
We would walk down the isle of destiny
What your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
Break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
That seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
But there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover

[Hook: Boyz II Men]
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
Last week I saw ya at the mall
Standin' at the pay phone 'bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
Tellin' you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
We talked about travelin' the distant lands
Escapin' all the madness out here in the world
Becomin' my wife, no longer my girl
Then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
I kissed you softly and you yearned for more
We experienced pleasure unparallel
Into an ocean of love we both fell
Swimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
Fantasies interchangin' with each kiss
Undyin' passion unities our souls
Togehter we swim until the point of no control
But it's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true
We never even spoke and your man swear he love you
So I'm a keep all these feelin's inside
Keep my dreams alive until the right time

[Hook: Boyz II Men]
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than...
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, baby this is more than a crush
Hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

The time has come, we gotta expand, the whole operation
Distribution, New York, to Chicago, L.A
We gotta set our own market, and enforce it

[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Champagne wishes and caviar dreams a team that's gettin' cream
With sales of fish scales from triple beams I gleam
Livin' the life of Riley packin' fifty calis
Rockin lizard Bally's while we do our drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos just me and my dino primo
Pushin beam-o's then parlay in Reno with two fly latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count math from steam baths
We've seen a half a Milli Jackson out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin papers by the layers
And those that portray us on the block get rocked like Amadeus
Fakers get used as shootin targets, soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us try to beat us we got hookers with heaters
That'll straight pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
Da leaders, lookin straight charming in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas you gots come through a whole army
The cee-lo rollers, money folders, sippin' Bolla, holdin mad payola
Slangin that Coke without the Cola
Me and black don't fake jacks but we might sling one
It ain't no shame in our game we do our thing son

[Chorus (x2)]
Livin' the Fast Life, in fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from out of Queens with the American Dream
So we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven figure cream

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo I got, guns from Italy, smoke trees, considerably
Mid-state and Green it seems, is where all my niggas be
The ghetto misery: shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular, angle of the clout war
Police searchin' up my Lexo but who's petro
My tech blows straight off the roof and tests yo' respect though
But dough don't respect me, it got me handcuffed
The rough life, I just be up nights, breathin' with scuffed Nike's
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years I got they names in my swears
Poppin Cristal like it's my first child, lickin shots, holiday style
Rockin Steele sweaters, Wallabee down
Twenty-four carats, countin cabbage, like the arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance, bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin Guinness shootin catchin cases concurrent
It's Nas, seven hundred wives, King Solomon size
We on the rise, me and G, ghetto wise guys
The Luciano, Frankie Yale, Bugsy Siegel
Green papers with eagles from a trade that's illegal

*singer* Brother you've got to make it happen
Yeahhhahhyeahhh, get this money, yeahhh
Brother you've got to make it happen
When you're living in the fast life, heyy yeah yeah

[Verse 3: G Rap & Nas]
[Rap] Aiyyo my lifestyle's exquisite, yayo like a blizzard
[Nas] Esquire attire standin on ground with one pivot
[Rap] Two players rockin silk blazers and diamonds like glaciers
[Nas] Lands with namebrand seats reclinin like in spaceships
[Rap] Bodies on ice
[Nas] Livin trife, rollin fixed up dice
[Rap] Gamblin Grants
[Nas] Handlin stamps
[Duo] Moves are sheist
[Nas] My bankrolls, got the cops comin in plain clothes
[Rap] Tryin to arraign again cause of our fame that's how the game goes
[Nas] True
[Rap] Right out the slammer with the fame and glamour
Cookin up grams with Arm & Hammer supplyin scramblers in Alabama
[Nas] Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases, preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin us Dom P my cliquo
Dimes with magnifico, puttin' in cut inside perico
Heat for foes, shoppin sprees with my fleet for clothes
In Carribean suites, deep, rippin beats with flows
[Rap] Aiyyo, we went from standin on blocks, without some socks
Sellin rocks, to pickin up stock and boat docks with Glocks
And got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin all the blue steel we keeps it real inside the battlefield
[Nas] Yeah so here's a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings, graveyards is buried with kings

[Verse 1]
Everybody listen up cause I'm about to get my speak on
Fools be trippin when it's time to get their freak on
Runnin round town, puttin it down with-out
No protection, for they erection
When it's time for selection what's your direction?
Before you make a choice, you betta do some inspection
If you don't know my aim and don't know my game, then
Let me explain now
Iesha slept wit Mark and Mark slept wit Tina
And Tina slept wit Javier the first time he seen her
Javier slept wit Lupe and Lupe slept with Rob
Cuz he was rollin on beads and had a good ass job
Rob slept wit Lisa who slept wit Steve and
Steve was positive, H.I.V
What started off as a plan ended up in the plot
Ya betta cool ya ass off cause it's too damn hot

[Hook: J.T. Taylor]
Oh-ohh it's too hot, *too hot*, too hot lady *too hot*
Gotta run for shelter, gotta run for shade
It's too hot, *too hot*, too hot homie *too hot*
Gotta make some sense, from this mess that we made

[Verse 2: Coolio]
You're doin everything momma told ya not to do
Now you're tryin to walk away cause ya know it's true
Your sister can't explain, and your brother's ashamed
To admit you both have the same last name
I don't have to ask you where you've been
Cause the matches in your purse say Holiday Inn
""A mind is a terrible thing to waste"" that was the slogan
But now it's ninety-five and it's ""Don't forget the Trojan""
Explained it to her momma, before somebody get her
Gotta hip her to the game of those smooth talkin niggas
Love is the word, seldom meant but often heard
Latex safe sex you better learn
Or get hip to the facts before you react or
End up in a box on your back
Sometimes you ask for what you want and, get what you got
Don't get caught up in the plot, it's too damn hot

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Coolio]
Another day in the city and, oh what a pity
Even though we did our duty things are still lookin shitty
Everybody in the pack stacked, tryin to make some scratch
Walkin in the rain but they ain't got no hat
Understand how we livin in the nineties loc
Nuclear waste, cannibalism, and pistol smoke
Sex lies videotape and rape
Just a little bump n grind can seal your fate
We need to do something drastic, shit is gettin tragic
And if you don't believe me, then go ask Magic
Everybody an they momma preachin abstinence, these
Kids ain't checkin for absti-shit
So put a condom in they hand and hope it don't bust
Another victim of the lust, in God we trust
What started off as a plan ended up in the plot
Water can't cool it off cause it's too damn hot

Because a brother like me known to make that secret blast
And I'ma make you right and ready, yo to cruise with me

That nigga makin' more off yo hits than you do
You fools, need to recognize this crew when I roll through

Coz ain't nuthin' on my mind but them chips

Back to the past on the Compton streetz
Where the niggas get beat when us gangstas meet
And fools gettin' mad coz they can't ride like I ride
Front 'n back, dippin' side to side
And it's been like that since I was BG
""It's the E,"" that's what they scream when they see me
Mama said every day is like this
Fools screamin' that I put em in a twist
Thought you had it bad, isn't really all good
If the homies only knew in the hood
That you was gettin' done like a two dollar ho
It's just a lil something from the E tah let U know...

On a quest to put that bomb in my chest
Coz them busta-ass niggas can't see what I'm sayin'

But I ain't givin' up nuthin' but this Glock in yo mouth
So recognize that and get yo punk ass knocked out
So if you wanna ride nigga jump on in
Sip a cup o' gin. Ain't no friends when it come to ends
So no hard feelings when you niggas be dealin'

Coz the only thing poppin' is a snaps
And ain't no fun when a nigga be tap perhaps
But a nigga like the E ain't trippin' though
I'm just here tah let U niggas know...

[Verse 1: Wyclef]
We used to be number 10
Now we're permanent one
In the battle lost my finger, Mic became my arm
Pistol nozzle hits your nasal, blood becomes lukewarm
Tell the woman be easy Naah squeeze the Charmin
Test Wyclef, see death flesh get scorned
Beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born jawn
And tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
Chicken George became Dead George stealing chickens from my farm
Damn, another dead pigeon;
If you're mafiosos then I'm bringing on Haitian Sicilians
Nobody's shooting, my body's made of hand grenade
Girl bled to death while she was tongue-kissing a razor blade
That sounds sick maybe one day I'll write a horror;
Blackula comes to the ghetto, jacks an ACURA
Stevie Wonder sees Crack Babies
Be-Coming Enemies
Of their own families!
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta run
A boy on the side of Babylon trying to front like he's down with
Mount Zion

[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Oooh La La La
It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thang
Oooh La La La
It's the natural LA that the Refugees Bring
Oooh La La La La La La Lalala La Laaah
Sweeeeet Thing

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
Yeah in saloons we drink Boone's
And battle goons till high noon
Bust rap tunes on flat spoons
Take no shorts like poom poom's
See hoochies pop coochies, for Gucci's and Lucci
Find me in my Mitsubishi, eating sushi, bumping Fugees
Hey Hey Hey - try to take the crew and we don't play play
Say say say - like Paul McCartney, not hardly
ODD-ly enough, I can see right through your bluff
Niggas huff and they puff but they can't handle us, WE BUST
Cause we fortified, I could never hide
Seen ""Cooley High"", cried when Cochise died
I'm twisted, black-listed by some other negroes
Don't remove my Polos on the first episode
Ha Ha Ha Ha, You shouldn't diss refugees, and
Ha Ha Ha Ha, You whole sound set's bootie, and
Ha Ha Ha Ha, You have to respect JERSEY, cause I'm superfly when I'm super-high on the Fu-Gee-La

[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Oooh La La La
It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thang
Oooh La La La
It's the natural LA that the Refugees Bring
Oooh La La La La La La Lalala La Laaah
Sweeeeet Thing

[Verse 3: Pras]
I sit 90 degrees underneath palm trees
Smoking beedi as I burn my calories
Brooklyn roof tops become Brooklyn tee-pees
Who that be, enemies, wanna see the death of me
From Hawaii to  Hawthorne, I run marathons, like
Buju Banton, I'm a true champion, like
Farakkhan reads his daily Qu'ran
It's a phenomenon
Lyrics fast like Ramadan

[Wyclef]
What's going on
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta run
A boy on the side of Babylon, trying to front like he's down with
Mount Zion

[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Oooh La La La
It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thang
Oooh La La La

We, hah!
This is Funk Doctor Spock!
As we look, at our clocks
We gonna take you, on a ship to another journey
To the Darkside
Hah, we've conquered, new evidence, that there is life

[Verse 1]
My funk prognosis make my brains comatose
One hundred percent funk runs blood straight through your nose
I don't have to be Madonna, to make your eyes freeze
Visine's for eyes when you smoke the thai weed
For this, you need a journalist scientist
Keep your eye in this, funk cosmical, far from logical
I blow the spot up in any hood or boondox
Make the bully of the block move and get new locks
Now who kicks that phenomical astronomical? Uhh
That's my nine in you, feelin nauseous? That's my rhyme in you
I swing funk like numchuks my game's death
That's cool when I blind fools like Kareem Abdul
Hot like lava's fire, sometimes I get more higher than Cheech
My funk speech make words wear sun visors
I'm gettin down with the funk in your trunk
Def Squad's in the house, with the *95* for all you punks

[Hook]
""Coming down the block man loud as fuck
You would swear Redman was inside the trunk

[Verse 2]
Ahhh, I'm just as high as three peeled up motherfuckers
Def Squad's in the house, with the *95* for you suckers
Punks, y'all chumps, I blew the frame once twice
I'm dumb nice, I bring my worst lyrics to a gunfight
The top notch, nah fuck that, that notch's topped
I'm off the meter, I make computer's catch amnesia
I'm swifter than roller blades on Icecapades
I'm Fearless like Four plus I'm Kool like Aid
My grammar, slam from here to York, Alabama
I never pull my pants up, I'm nutty like Planters
My style gets Death like Row or Def like Jef
Def like Jam or Squad, or death like Meth
One two! Big up to my niggas on one deuce
That cocks snaps and busts back at the boys in *blue*
Rrrrrah! With weed for you!
Who says I can't burn shit up just like Lisa Lopes?
I cause the ruckus, my area is fucked up
You better off calling them Power Ranger motherfuckers
Cause Redman will bomb just like Sadaam
When I'm loose I'm worldwide like triple fat goose
Heavily armed

The first stop PCH and atlantic, the homefront
Poly apartments where the party still jumps
From dusk to dawn, makin me yawn, cuz I'm out late
Smokin in the cut with the homies, 86 the date
Don't feel like trippin tonight, so I get back
More concerned with my paper, cause now I'm on contract
Wonderin if this meal ticket a guarantee
Me a way out of the Eastside of LB
But you know like I know, ain't no place like home
Gone for a second best believe that I'm back home
24-7 where the love just don't stop
Comedian done tell the homies on the block
Get together, cuz ain't nothin changed but my mood
I might get to tweak and start to trippin on fools
But I chill, I hangs with them niggas that's real
Headed to the Eastside nigga you know the deal

(Chorus)

[Wayniac]
Now as time passes by I sit and wonder where it all went
Days at King Park when free lunch was the lick
Hangin out baggin with the homies on the block
Some workin jobs, others slingin rocks
Blazin up that thai bumpin shit from way back
All my niggas in the cut tryin to keep away from flack
Everybody drinkin so we all gotta stroll
Some drinkin 8-Ball others black and gold
Gotta get my hair cut so you know I gots to peel
Bellin back from PCH on my way to Bobby Neal's
Tighten up my fade make a stop at VIP
I'm on the lookout, the latest hit from DJ Warren G
At night we steppin scandlous tryin to party with the skirts
Wit a glass in your hand, time to put in work
The Eastside steady dippin plenty drama in the name
Wit nine into that nine folk peepin everything

Chorus

I step right out the club to the party by my mama house
It don't close till four and everybody still hangin out
Just-a-laughin, talkin, crackin them jokes
Got the munchies like a mutha we still gonna smoke
Loc I know I can't make it to the nickel tonight (And why is that?)
Chocolate Thai got me through for the night
So carry on cuz I'm gone in the wind my friends
Showin' nothin' but the love for the city I'm in

If you can groove to this well then smoke
If you can move to this well then Loc
Because ain't no party like an Eastside party
Cuz a Eastside party ain't no joke

It's really real, when I feel the way that I do right now
I see all my brothers underground
Pushing up daisies, man, it amazes me
That you can't see where you gonna be
A statistic, everybody's gon' call ballistic
If you had a good day, damn, I must have missed it
Cause you mad at the Universe
Going to hell with everybody else cause you want your own first
I got the urge to let you in on a little secret
Cause you keep dying if I keep it
All the keeling that you're feeling is from within
For the copper check the color of your skin
Why lie? I couldn't try even if I had to
Born with the bullet-proof vest when I had you
A black woman trying to get through to the few
So you can leave the next crew

5 o'clock in the morning. Where you gonna be?
(Outside on the corner)
You better get yourself together
While you're wasting all your time
Right along with your mind

5 o'clock in the morning. Where you gonna be?
(Outside on the corner)
You better get yourself together
While you're wasting all your time
Right along with your mind

(Bink Woods Dre):
Why should I do right and suffer
I rather do wrong making that loopy and that hustler
Instead of hot-dogs I'm eating porks up in their smother
And got a gang of loot up in the safe up in my covers
On top of all that I push big fat Lex
And got my hoes that in golf course just in case I feel like flexing
So I must ask, for real though, who are you
See, I'm a big man

(Drecia Vega):
Yeah, you know you'se a big man, check it
I went for twelve years to school and never could read
A knowledge of my hood is something they can never teach me
I never started to step but I kept up with the Joneses
Having rollers... my little pinky ring
I did a lot of kinky thing the girls knew it, flock into it
I'm around my old way, yeah, they still wants to do it
Its not about the clothes that you got on your back
But the money in your pocket and if you're down like that
Come on

5 o'clock in the morning. Where you gonna be?
(Outside on the corner)
You better get yourself together
While you're wasting all your time
Right along with your mind

5 o'clock in the morning. Where you gonna be?
(Outside on the corner)
You better get yourself together
While you're wasting all your time
Right along with your mind

Wella, Mr. Black Man tell me where you're heading
The last few years I watched while you were sheading
Pounds and pounds on growth for the population
Soon we won't be able to have a strong black nation
A shooting here, a stabbing there nowhere to stop
Cause now you're dying from the dose of the crack rock
I'm just a Nubian Queen that needs a king to stand strong
And try to press on
It's not a white man's finger on the trigger
Car-jacks, drive-by's, callin' each other ""nigga""
I'm not here to scold but rather shape n' mold
That young black mind that won't live to grow old
Cause you're fronting smoking on the blunt and
Down with your friends cause you think you're making ends
But you're not - and that's the truth of the matter
Your brother gettin' skinny, cause you want your pockets fatter

5 o'clock in the morning. Where you gonna be?
(Outside on the corner)
You better get yourself together
While you're wasting all your time
Right along with your mind

5 o'clock in the morning. Where you gonna be?
(Outside on the corner)
You better get yourself together
While you're wasting all your time
Right along with your mind

Because my ride is awaiting our date and
Of steak and a night cap
We mating, awaking
By smells of perfume that I inhale
And then tell how well we raise hell on the dizzell
Satin sheets
Heat from your feet keep me warm
The mood is perfected by sounds from the storm
You came stronger, I lasted longer
Than I've ever lasted, your mouth was fantastic
The fuck test, you passed it
The way you made a nigga laugh, I had to getcha
And when I saw that ass pass, I had to hit cha
Ya making me fight against my will, what must I do
Would ya kill for me, ya if my life in danger too
Even steal for me, ya if that shit belongs to you
Then feel for me, ya if the way you act is true
Who knows, fine clothes
Lexus doors you'll be closing, when you become one of the chosen
Hoes in different places, different faces
Different cases, got me tied like shoe laces
No mistake this MJG, you ain't gotta be
Constantly trying to shoot that P, claiming that you ain't heard of me

It feels so right, this indo got me perving
Let's go hop in my Suburban
And ride til we get to where you want to be, no matter how far
Just call me Oball baby, to me you're the superstar
Ask me time and time again why did I choose you
Do I wanna be your man or just misuse you
I hear your partners dissing
When they think I ain't listening
Them hoes just be wishing
They could be in yo position
With me in luxury
I got to be everyday
Chiefin' hay with something stout wearing lingerie
Let's hit the ’tel
Get a suite
An order something to eat
Tell me things about you
I'll tell you things about me
Then out the blue I'll be carressing you, undressing you
You start doing all shit you said you'd never do
Lustin busting all out of my boxer drawers
Fingers dripping slipping in an out in an out
Constantly telling me the things you don't do
Yet you do it like a pro and think I don't know
But I do that's why I'm here with you and you know this
Slip on the latex, and dive in

Everybody give it to me S-E-X
Now with the proper equipment, it works best
And nothing less, relieves stress
Now if she says yes, you know I gotta knock it
Cause you saw me poppin like Orvell Redenbacher
In case you need a notion, Hennessey's the potion
Hit the climax if you want the sex lotion
CUM CUM now are you really that umm Dumb Dumb
On these cool procedures bout gettin some some
Putang, when it comes to ""P"" I'm a ""G"" and
Daddy never taught me bout the birds and the bees
But I, took a hint and with a little motion
Stuck it in a chick and had her flowin like an ocean
And now I gotta have it, just like a rabbit
Fuck Fuck Fuck with the semi-automatic

But heres a little something that you should know
I don't test the rain without the raincoat
Now if you one of those who don't like a rubber on your lover
Then the niggie Domino can truely find another
Wait... for me to give you a sex shower
And the good thing about it is it don't take an hour
For me to go from attention to at ease
Baby, try to take an easy on me please
Sexy ass freak, your love is so sweet
But you can kill a man with the tip of your teeth
So not too slow and not too fast
And I like to see a sexy with a string in her ass
Now tell me, are you that chunk of the month?
Then maybe we can share a little Physical Funk

[Chorus]

So now you know, Physical Funk is the Pump
And the bump which I like to stunts
And this is how I do it, back in the hood
Can't seem to go without nature's feel good
Cause homies like to feel that wet up and down
And ladies like to feel it deep round and round
And just to put this bomb ass track in context
Everybody with me if you like sex

OOCHIE COOCHIE LA LA LA OOCHIE COOCHIE
OOCHIE COOCHIE LA LA LA OOCHIE COOCHIE

And nothing like liquid love between the sheets
And if your not a virgin then you'll agree
Its always so good when junks in your trunks
Physical Funk

[Intro]
1995; crack the bubbly
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Yo, word is bond

[Verse 1]
Yo, look who just jumped up on the scene
Pocket full of green, butter in leather and all
I be's that nigga named Jamal
Mackin' hoes in the tight clothes with pretty toes
Kickin' flows for all the rowdy bros and it goes, look
1, 2, to the breaker 1-9-9-5
Jamal representin', keep it live
It don't matter how I come on these funk raw tracks with raps
We 'bout to still make snaps
We got bitches for days, rich as it pays
Damn shits changed since back in the days (get money)
In my mouth is where the blunt stays blazed
And I get dazed to kick a phrase to amaze
I'm gettin' busier, leavin' hoes dizzier
Than they even been with the grown men
Is he a straight looney type of nigga
That'll drop the temperature?
Bitch, I ain't really into ya

[Chorus]
To all the tramp goldiggers
(Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all) (x2)
To all the misrepresenters
(Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all) (x2)
To all the bitch-ass niggas
(Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all) (x2)
To all the tramp goldiggers
(Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all) (x2)

[Verse 2]
I drop the lines and blow your mind y'all
When I be comin' on that ill tip
My whole crew pack nines, don't make me have to kill shit
Uh, I bring the flavor to you ear
Smash and trash MC's from the front to the rear
In '95 until, I still kick the ill lyrical miracles
Leavin' rappers hysterical
I keep it raw and when I got the gat I hit'em all
And on the M-I-C I rip'em all
Yeah, word up, this is dedicated to my peeps
On 6-0 and 6-1 on the Illedelphiatic streets
Take it to the recently deceased
H-Town, Tall D, rest in peace
Word is bond, as the beat heat up
Psychotic thoughts starts to lead up
I got the sauce to make the Billboard bullet speed up
Yo, word up, right on, Jamal gots the vibe y'all
And that's the deal on the real, I gets ill y'all
It's Philly's finest behind this doin' damage
No matter how scandalous they can't handle this
Handle what? Underground sound
I stick my dick in the ground then I turn the whole world around!
And blow the sun up, word is bond, we blow the sun up
Niggas they run up, tryin' to stop the come up and get done up
Put your guns up, I blaze your buns up when I rock your spot
Niggas they all stiff when the red dots to they knot

[Chorus]
To all the tramp goldiggers
(Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all) (x2)
To all the misrepresenters
(Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all) (x2)
To all the bitch-ass niggas
(Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all) (x2)
To all the tramp goldiggers
(Keep it real y'all, gotta keep it real y'all) (x2)

[Hook]
1 2 3 4 get your woman on the floor
Gotta Gotta get up to get down
Gotta Gotta get up to get down

[Verse 1]
What up everybody, so glad you're here
It's Coolio wit' the flow back in your ear
This ain't a fantastic voyage, but I'm still on a mission
To see if I can get your attention

Now I wanst to drop some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk

When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so
Throw your hands up if you're down with the C
Double O, L, I, O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know

1 2 3, it's like A B C
If hip hop didn't pay, I'd rap for free
Slide, slide, but that's that past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If you got beef, then nigga eat a pork chop
Once I get it goin', you know it don't stop
I break like dandylocks, panties drop
From hood to hood, block to block

Help, I need somebody
To get it goin' on in this party
Baby you can do it, take your time do it right
We can drink some yak and do it all damn night

My name ain't Wanda, but I'll rock your world
Get more bounce than a jerry curl
Too many looky loos be lookin' for clues
There's a party goin' on, now whatcha gonna do, so

Grab your partner, do se do
If you don't know who it is, it's Coolio
Slide, slide, but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

[Hook]

Rhyme 3:
Push, push, in the bush
But don't step on my toes cuz you might get smushed
It's the brother from around the way
And what I say I been comin' on three like Dr. Dre

Comin' at 'em with pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms
I hope you don't trip cuz I don't want to have to gat 'em
So move your body baby, drive the homeys crazy
The way you shake that ass, always amaze me

Ain't no party like a west coast party
Cuz a west coast party don't stop
So when you see a young nigga
In a Chevy hittin' switches, then you gotta give the nigga his props

I got size in my rise and the motion for your ocean
Coolio got the potion to kick the party open
Slide, slide, but that's the past
I got sumpin' brand new for that ass

[Verse 1]
My old boy from the point
But I'm from Southwest and every
Now and then I get put to the test
But I can't be stopped
Cause I gotta come true ain't go no gun
But I got my crew
Didn't come for no beef cause I don't eat steak
I got a plate of soul food chicken, rice and gravy
Not covered in too much
Drinking a cup of punch, tropical
Every last Thursday of the month

[Verse 2]
Daddy put tha hot grits on my chest in tha morning
When I was sick Mary had tha hot soup boiling
Didn't know why but it felt so good
Like some waffles in that morning
Headed back to tha woods
Now I'm full as tick
Got some soul on blast in tha cassette
Food for my brain
I haven't stopped learning yet
Hot wings from Mo-Joes
Got my forehead sweating
Celery and blue cheese on my menu next

[Verse 3]
Southern Fry won't allow my body to lie still
Tied face goons surround me like cancer drill
Me with second-hand obstables
But, only to make matters worse
Plus I'm getting pimped by this temp lady Jackie
From Optima staffing figure laughing
Shut up clown don't talk to me
Like that looking stupid of course
Living day by day and you ain't hard
Trick hell you say?

[Verse 4]
It's such a blessing when my eyes
Get to see the sun rise
Another chance to get further away from where I've been, what I'll never forget everythang I went through
I appreciate the shit because
If I hada went and took the easy way
I wouldn't be the strong nigga that I am today
Everythang that I did
Different thangs I was told
Just ended up being food for my soul

[Hook]
Come and get yo' soul food, well well
Good old-fashioned soul food, all right
Everythang is for free
As good as it can be
Come and get some soul food

[Verse 5: Khujo]
Sunday morning where you reating at?
I'm on 1365 Wichita Drive
Ole' burd working the stove ride
Churches dropping chicken in yesterday's grease
Didn't go together with this quart of Mickey's
Last night hanging over from a good time
Yeah beef is cheaper but
It's pumped with ""red dye"" between two pieces of bread
Shawty look good with dem hairy legs
Wish I could cut her up but, ma stomach come before sex
A house full of hoes now what's the ingredient
Spaghetty plus her monthly flow

[Verse 6: T-Mo]
They know they making it hard on the yard
Fuck Chris Darden, fuck Marcia Clark
Taking us when we're in the spotlight for a joke
Changing by the day I see it's getting bigga in my square
Looking at Lenox from the outside
With a stare no money to go inside
Tameka and Tiffany outside tripping
And skipping rope to the beats from my jeep
As I speak wuz up from the driver seat

[Verse 7: CeeLo Green]
A heaping helping of fried chicken
Macaroni and cheese and collard greens
Too big for my jeans
Smoke steams from under the lid that's on the pot
Ain't never had allot but thankful for
The little that I got why not be
Fast food got me feeling sick
Them crackers think they slick
By trying to make this bullshit affordable
I thank the Lord that my voice was recordable

[Verse 8: Big Gipp]
(Come an get your soul food, well, well)
Hold up C it's what I write
And Miss Lady acting like we in jail
Says she ain't got no extra hush puppis to sell
Bankhead seafood making me hit that door
With a mind full of attitude
It was a line at tha beautiful
JJ'S Ribshack was packed too
Looking to be one of dem days
When Momma ain't cooking
Everybody's out hunting with tha family
Looking for a little soul food

Nobody on the streets cares for me
No packages or no messages

Whole lotta things done changed
Yeah, there's a lot of people puttin' black eyes in the game
Knahmean, time to do this though

Check it, I had a block locked, but took a fall now I'm off my feet
I gotta eat, so it's back to these fuckin' streets
And I will grow cause I'm a old timer
I bring the drama to any nigga, his babies or his fuckin' mama
I got a look like Tevin Campbell
But still I gamble, hustle and scramble
Cause money is muscles in this damn zoo
And in order to make it, you gotta take it
Be the boom, blast booze, bend or break it but don't fake it
That's why there's no guilt for these trife niggas' bloods I spilt
Took what they built, flippin' they drug game on tilt
Cause in New York, dealin drugs is a sport
You either sell it, smoke it, shoot up or snort, either way you're caught
And since I'm in it, now I'm in it to win it; sky's is the limit
No more being some motherfucker's lieutenant
Shit, from this point that's how I feel, I wanna fly

It's like a jungle sometimes
It's like a jungle sometimes
The weed smoke makes me wonder
How I keep from going under

And all hoods I hang with mixed slang in they language
Love, kickin that gang shit, sellin on the same strip
Hustlin hard, no matter how much we hated
So dedicated, even our dreams are drug related
Shit, puff bananas, not even the cops can stand us
Cause of the way we vanish, everytime they come to can us
25 we get the money live - fuck all that funny jive
The streets is our only source to survive
And before any teeny-boppers think about tryin to stop us
I rather put your head, through the propellers of a helicopter
Cause all my peeps be playin for keeps
Straight out the litter, so bitter
These bandits don't even need sweets
Bringin the ruckus, like some mad motherfuckers
Move at night like truckers
When suckers see us, they duck us
Shit, only the real can relate to things a hungry man'll, try
It's either doe or die

[Refrain]

And ever since I was a tarface baby watchin' Scarface
I dreamed of guns and tons of coke on a car chase
A fat connect with a kingpin Colombian
Plus props from crooked cops, payin' him tops not to run me in
Keepin my toaster in a shoulder holster
Havin hoes playin me closer, sexin on a silk sofa
Livin the life of the rich and trife
Rugged but sharp like a kitchen knife
Without stress from some bitchin wife
What a life, that's why I be on what I be on
Always ready to war for a score that's sure to put me on
And until then, I won't seal in what I'm feelin
It was inside that I cried, but now its spillin
I'm goin all out, until I fallout; so much of a menace
When I finish milkin New York I'll have to fall out
On the run, cause I know feds'll try to knock me
And railroad my soul to a hellhole if they got me
But not me, I'm goin out fightin until I fry
From hot lead no lie, like I said it's either doe or die

[Refrain]

Visualizin' the realism of life and actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary

[Refrain]

If not why not
Either you're in it, or your in the way Baby Pah
New yields, no quills
I want it all

Ah, 1, 2, 1, 2
Mic check 1, 2, 1, 2
1, 2, 1, 2, uh
1, 2, 1, 2
Mic check 1, 2, 1, 2

[Verse 1: Mack Daddy]
I devoted my whole life to rockin' mics gettin' crowds lifted
Put my pants on backwards 'cause I wanted to be different
I keeps 'em with a crease, timepiece Bertolucci
House full of honeys sportin' Gucci, cuttin' coochie
I'm the man, girlfriend, luxury I swim
Macadocious to the most, brown, sexy, slim
Setter of trends, known for making dividends
And millions of people jump, jump, jump, jump...

[Verse 2: Da Brat]
Now who choose to be the next nigga to step, get deleted by Def
Undefeated, ain't no thang to put that body to rest
Chest filled with smoke, yolkin' niggas up by the collar
Follow me 'cause my dollars makin' more sense than Common
Robbin' you for your money and your diamonds
Endangerin' your species
More Than A Woman like The Bee Gees
No remorse, steady smokin' plenty grass (let it go)
And let Da Brat commence to be the baddest hoe

[Chorus 2X: Mack Daddy & Da Brat]
Well, nigga, roll me a mic and let me smoke 'til I'm high
If you ever seen me rock then you know that I
Live and die for the things I do
Slang I use, breakin' down mics, and destroyin' crews

[Verse 3: Daddy Mack]
Yachts is by the sea, big party (twelve until)
See I'm the Daddy of the Mack and at the top of world
I chill, keep it real
My field of work consists of that
Thuggish ass niggas sayin', ""Where they keep that pistol at?"" (My life)
I wouldn't trade it, to me, it's nothin' better
Wakin' up when I wanna, sportin' Jay Boogie leather
Autographs, bubble baths, five-star hotels
Rollin' wit' a click super thick and everybody's gettin' mail

[Verse 4: Mr. Black]
Take off the safety and face me
Gun powder chowder for real
The last nigga figured to ever make it off the hill
But still rhymes rock like coke that smoke
And I'm in effect with a Tec that got a infrared scope
Smackin' those actin' tough as Tinactin
Fall up in yo' hood increase your brain with the Mac-10
Stack ends, seventeens on the Benz
And burner by my thigh in case these niggas wan' die

[Chorus: Daddy Mack & Mr. Black]

[Bridge: Aaliyah]
Oh ooh, something tells me
We got it goin' on, we're turnin' ya on
It's that So So Def...

[Verse 5: Jermaine Dupri]
I want you to feel me
My whole thang is to get inside your body
I run game like my name was John Gotti
Hittin' hook shots like Vlade
And niggas around my way call me Little Liberace
A lady lover like no other
And I be lethal with my weapon so they call me Danny Glover
Now who keep it hot? (We Do.)
See, So So Def ain't nothin' but a fool-ass crew

Ah, ahhh, huh..
Ain't no shorts gon' be taken, word up

If headz only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd know - I ain't goin out
If headz only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd know - I ain't goin out

[Heather B]
""I'm Every Woman,"" like Whitney, and Chaka
I sparks the green lye, the choc' thai, that good ganja
I stay mad bent, twisted up like a pretzel
Rainin on hoes in weak shows like Tempest Bledsoe
My head so heavy, heavy-headed, heavy-handed
It be these wild niggas that I roll and stand with
I be rhymin 'til dusk, bout trials and triumph
My grill be like what? Niggas know, I don't give a fuck
I stay in touch with the streets, the corners
Employed by the people, start slackin, a goner
You wanna know why I keep it real, cause it's easy
Fuck the fancy shit, it's the simple things that please me
I sports fat gear, along with no name shit
As long as I got me some cash, I don't care who name on my hip
I'm doin shit for noventa-seis
That's nine-six in Spanish, why don't your wack ass vanish

[Chorus]

[Heather B]
Demolition done, competition none
Reputation unsung strong long ground what
I got verbals, got herbals, and antihistamines
I'm herbally and verbally distributin you listenin
It's more to it, than a Lex and duplex
Don't sell sex or 'mote sex sells, I got more respect
Dressed in jeans, Gortex and striped rugbies
With the strength of fifty-four niggas, word, that love me
Hoes ain't ready for the shit I got
And when I finally rock they'll see I turned it up a notch
No more comin, but yo' crack is wide open
Or try to be hardcore, claimin, you totin
I hope that you be hopin, when I'm rhymin, I'm jokin
My tech', is more complex than weed smokin
Senile, it's time that I get more agile
Style versatile, FUCK doin a minute, in the penile
Attitude hostile, intelligently hostile
Not just the rhymes but my frame of mind will drop you

[Chorus]

[Heather B]
To all the doubters, givin they opinion
My rhyme style winnin so I'll just keep spittin
Yeah, I'm just nasty like that and I don't give a fuck no more
Fuck that herb and his whore, cause yo
In my last game of freestylin I dropped fifty
They did me none, mad jump shots and add ones
And then the tech', for bringin bitches down by they neck
Yo stop it, now there's no need to get wrecked
You play wild, but my style was flagrant and it's foul
I'll have you wipin shit wit'cho white towel
I crashed yo' bust cause you don't think when you shoot
That made it way back downcourt and caught a ill alley-oop
OOH!  Heather B, y'all ain't know I get up
Plus I make my lay-ups, so all you heffers shut the FUCK UP
A team player, strategy the full court press up
Fat jersey and a baggy short Guess
Yeah, I even spotted 'em ten and did damage
Let them pick the refs plus they had home court advantage
But even then, I'm not one to underestimate
So the whole forty-eight I banged out in the paint
And when it all, was put on the line
Tied score, second left in double overtime
These bitches went and fouled me, they must not know
That in the clutch, Heather B was gon' sink both free throws

When judgment comes for you

Now tell me, what ya gonna do
When it ain't nowhere to hide
When judgment comes for you
'Cause it's gonna come for you

[Verse 1: Bizzy Bone]
Dead souls, nigga, this for Wally
Eazy, C's Uncle Charlie
Little Boo, but God's got him
And I'm gonna miss everybody
I done rolled with blows like AIDS
Looked at him while he laid
And prayed, but destiny played too deep for me to say
Lil' Layzie came to me
Told me if he should decease, ""well, then please
Bury me by my Gran Gran
And when you can, come follow me.""

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days
God is who we praise
Even though the Devil's all up in my face
But He keepin' me safe and in my place
Say grace to the gates we race
Without a chance to face the judge
Then I guess my soul won’t budge
Grudge, because there’s no mercy for thugs
Ooh, what could I do?
It's all about a family and how we roll
Can I get a witness? Let it unfold
We livin' our lives to eternal our souls, hey-o-ayo

Now follow me, roll stroll
Whether it's Hell or it's Heaven
Come let's go take a visit to the people that's long gone, they rest: Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
And still keepin' up with they family
Exactly how many days we got lastin'?
While you laughin' we're passin' passin' away
God, rest our souls
'Cause I know I might meet you up at the crossroads
Y'all know, y'all forever got love from them Bone Thugs, baby

[Verse 4: Wish Bone]
Lil E-Z long gone
Really wish he could come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go, bye bye
All a lil' thug could do was cry, cry
Why'd they kill my dog?
Damn, man, I miss my Uncle Charles, y'all
And he shouldn't be gone
In front of his home, what they did to Boo was wrong
Oh so wrong, was so wrong
Gotta hold on, gotta stay strong
When the day comes
Better believe Bone got a shoulder you can lean on, lean on

Every day, every day, every day, every day

Bass gets to thumpin' rucas get to pumpin'
Who's that rockin' got the party start jumpin'
Blastin' through hah no need for the booyaa
Right hammer with the one knuckle eye-shot through ya
Step to the crowd, I feel the strain'
Throw chingasos in the mosh pit, feel the pain
So don't get in my way baby
Because the Guero loco came in here to play baby

¿Qué ondas, muchacho?,  ahi vienes, te miro
Si me traes bronca me a loco deatiro
Me paro, te tumbo, no es tu rumbo
Y con el lingo, tal vez te confundo
Oh shit, it's the attack of the five foot ten
The Blaxican once again with the cocked hair pin
As I emerge from the depths of the realm my son
I got the black gat fat track coke and rum
Otra vez ya lo vez and the crew somos tres
One Blaxican on the squad you don't test
Hittin' hard like an Aztec, swift like a Zulu
That's what it's like with a palm shot through you
My mannerism mild still the punks get piled
My number one assassin flips the mad funk styles
Me I play the back role but I'm delinquente
This is how I freak it when I'm speaking to the gente

Whatcha trucha, calmate escucha
Somos delinquentes tu no quieres lucha
But we freak it this way seguí sendo rey
O.G. freaks the beat the mariachis play
Fade it in with snare from ASR-10
Producer mas mejor it's O.G. Style again
Freak it, bump it, bass out the carro
O.G. he's got more BOOM BOOM than charo

Hold down the needle with a penny or a peso

Nobody ever said life was gon' be easy
But damn..

[ VERSE 1 ]
Just a kid, moms died when I was seven
Pops died, eleven, what's up with heaven?
It's hell when you're an orphan at a early age
This impressionable stage, no love breeds rage
In the heart of a child who never knew his roots
Looked up to pimps and to hustlers in the eel-skin boots
Parkin Caddies on the sidewalk, gangsta talk
Truckin diamonds and gold
Rubberbands around the bankrolls
Fly girls to make your head spin
Seemed they partied all night long
I was like, ""Put me on""
But they said, ""Little fellow, run and go play
Take your butt to school or else you'll have to be like us one day""
I didn't understand, but I tried to get a job
While all the players got the girls cause they'd hustle and rob
I was like makin 'bout 1-50 a week
And after taxes, you know what that is - lunch meat

And I know I can be better than this
I gotta get me a car, man
I gotta get a girl

I know I can do it out there, man
I'm gonna go for it, man
I gotta get some money
Word

[ VERSE 2 ]
Streets of anger, trouble and crime
I had it hard, had to sleep in my car sometime
But I never let another player see me down
I kept my front up, my gear clean
Even when checkin minor green
Brothers knew my game was true
So I hooked up with the real crew
That knew excactly what to do
Bank jobs and jewels, quick to flex with tools
Pimpin hoes on the block
Checkin cash non-stop
Crack spots, armor with interior bars
No lie, I used to own 'bout 15 cars
Every piece Fila made
Drape my women in suede
Pavet Piaget, Cesar's Palace holidays
It was on, crazy out of control
We made up the word 'ballin', that was how we rolled
But the FBI had a-whole-nother idea
It's called multiple indictments for hundreds of years

What
Daff is dead?
Carter got 25 years?
Nah..
Spike 35 to life?
Nah, don't tell me B.O.'s dead, man
I don't wanna hear that, man
I was just with him

[ VERSE 3 ]
The game is vicious, no retirement, you die young
Listen to a fake, he might tell you to grab a gun
I get phone calls from condemned row
Brothers I ran with, brothers I really know
They tell me, ""Ice you got much love in the pen
You're the one that got away, don't wanna see you in""
They tell me, ""Tell the little homies the deal
Don't let em come up in this hellish habitat of shanks and steel""
I marched two million strong in D.C
Lookin eye to eye with brothers that I used to think below me
Damn, my mind was twisted in my hustlin days
But God spared me, I got a baby son to raise
And bein black ain't easy, prejudice is real
But health and liberty is all we need for us to build
We gotta come together, unseparated
Check yourself like I did, blackman, because we're all related

They wasn't down back when the bull funked the cow
But the chest of the cow was vestless
So the stank from the D-thang bang left the breathless
Oregano flow
Don't waste your time sticking out your chest, for no
Reason: its the season for the lovely flow:
The 'D', we're sick enough of stress, let it go
Now follow as I slip into the butter melody
This is the part I take your heart and leave your vision blurry

Catch a look just like a hooker catch j-izm

As I flavour up this vide' like oregano:
Slinging them nouns and verbs
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I guess I'm kind of different cause I do love them hoes
Only not the same way that I love my niggaroes
Cause I love it when they say something fly
The ill caps make me laugh till I cry
Some fries and some freaks and it's on, all night long
I love to see my homies living strong
But that cook with the cloudy cookbook
Rained salt on another brother's sunny day
I wonder are we really happy here with this lonely G game we play

A little high belongs to you . . 
- Yeah, getting high off the soup, (drink it up)
A little high belongs to me . .

A little high belongs to me . .

Now everybody's looking but they cannot see
The 'D' because we're future and we're too slippery
You know we're coming with oregano flow
Don't waste your time sticking out your chest, for no
Reason it's the season for the lovely flow:
The 'D', we're sipping off the stress, let it go, let it go

Top rhyming's how we're coming with the loops . . 
Oregano, baby, oregano

A little high belongs to you . . 
- Yeah, my soup'll get you high, (drink it up)

Wild Cowboys and you know this
Lookin at a Cowboy and you know they're dead

A lot of niggas stepped up to the bad man
Chest bucked out with your head wide open
Hopin, to spot, a chip in this frame
I lived and died by the burnin flame
Of the OK Corral, Cowboy style
From the Quarters on down to Colorado's
Big niggas from uptown, ridin into Tahoe's
Saloon settin, kids is walkin round
Drinkin whiskey and scotch, strictly out of shotglasses
Lookin screwfaced at the next nigga who passes
There's women in garter belts and ciggarettes
And on the side there's the price game
Niggas is playin the price game
Indian Red, was bangin niggas in the head
With his man Apache Joe, they take your money off the floor
They side-bettin for a better, they makin cheddar
That tribal shit is work ya sound the wompom drums
Cause my Indian man'sll break your great dick, UHH
Walk in the New York terrority
On the back of a tree, there's a picture of me
It says I'm lawless, flawless, a hustler plus gun rustler
Wanted in Carolina, for sellin some of New York's finer
Marshal Cooper say he want me, Marshal Cooper gotta get me
Marshal Cooper say beat me, Marshal Cooper better wet me
I gather alla y'all, all of my trusted men
All of my baddest niggas, niggas that's quickest with the triggers
There's distrubin news on the wire
That my dome piece is done sent to piece out for hire
I ain't goin down over no money exchange
You late for say I, who reigns as King of the Range?

In this land of wildness
Yo you better pack your vest
In the streets there's nothin but crime
So you best to watch your behind...

Meanwhile saloon settin is back to full swing
Bar's gettin money people doin they thing
There's strictly Boss Players with this kid named Minnesota
As women start to fill up, turn the notch on the grill up
And add mo' stakes to the house banks for gamblers
Half-pipes to scramblers, and free for Wild Cowboys
You never bring decoys if you wanna make real nouse
The bigger the stick, the bigger the fire
I never hit a man in the back, a coward acts like that
Lay out my black hat cause I feel like the bad man
Who on the rise, the D's to Manhattan
Let's walk the thirty paces on the Now Rule races
Oh it's the Marshal Cooper, and I love how he doin this
Women sayin don't get hurt, and I ain't plannin on it
Ten steps taken as I hit the blam factor
His dick to act up, was death the benefactor
Leave him twitchin in the dirt like Cousin Harold from the Menace
I'm in this to win this on the great wide trail
I'm ten times as bad as John Wayne, could ever be
Plus I'm down with the Indian, and need high to get the shit again
I'm responsible for that body in the alley
I'll Louisiana Purchase that ass with with Remi's spurs
And hard shots of Tequila, where the dancin girls
Let's get right as the story unfurls
Piano man keep playin, keep them keys bangin
Single man get three graves there's gonna be a hangin
Now this right here ain't for the youth to see
A grown man assed out swingin from a tree

In this land of wildness
Yo you better pack your vest
In the streets there's nothin but crime
So you best to watch your behind

Joe Tex was the biggest hombre from the projects
Had all the work locked down, so he thought
But he drank and got loose lipped, let a lot of news slip
Stripped of his game and got his self murdered
Thoughts of him are passin like the buffalo
Got his self rocked in the ninety-six brand new Acura
Niggas said it was lightning BLAOW blew out the back mirror
Hah, youknowhatI'msayin? Dig, check it out
They say that Cowboys never die they just ride off into the sun
A little tale from Sadat X of how the WORLD was won
Check it out, remember this
Gun-slingers, dead-ringers with presidents
Is found tied with no explanation of how they died
Yo the great Sadat X, the High Plains Drifter
No question

In this land of wildness
Yo you better pack a vest
In the streets there's nothin but crime
So you best to watch your behind

Yo everyone and their moms waiting on this album man get me up outta here man
Yo don't even wet that you know what I'm sayin the plans in effect
What?
I got you boo
We'd like to dedicate this particular tune
To all to all to all the hell of ya from wherever

[Channel Live] But there's only weak rappers steady making hits, fuck that!

Verse One:

I drop clarity like charity, every time I speak out
Rappers freak out, but never stick their necks too deep out
And touch the live wire, gettin live like from Guyana
Jim Jones kool-aid you got mad reason to be afraid
You ain't ready, rappers are petty, never lyrical
It's a miracle they need to reign as they physical
To get blessed, East vs. West, we never on that
Cause the rugged format you can get from where you're born at
So learn this, to burn this, you gotta earn this
With your rap style be the firmest, forget about your color of epidermis
For advantages, there's bandages, whatever your language is
You be in Danger like that Blahzay triangle is
The Blah pre your mind freein
Not the fatigue wearin jewels glarin rapper, you used to seein
Absestos study lessions to make impressions
The P's come and squeal on the real I'm mad excited
I got my deal but still...

Chorus:

You don't know the pain I feel
But there's all these weak rappers steady making hits, fuck that!
Cuz cuz cuz you don't know the pain I feel
But there's all these weak, rappers, steady making hits
You don't know the pain I feel
But there's all these weak rappers steady making hits, fuck that!
Cuz cuz cuz you, cuz, cuz you don't know the pain I feel
But there's all these weak, rappers, steady making hits

Verse Two:

Now everybody lamp go ahead get amped for your camp
Without no harmony your Normandy will never be the champ
And let me mention, no racial tension the way the rule goes
I flows with bros, PF flows with papa chulos
We combine cluster, you can't muster break your ligaments
Building my predicaments, living with the immigrants
See special blow your vest or do it thorough
That's blurro, my referral don't try to rally up your borough
Just warm, stay calm if you don't got steel in your palm
You'll peel me, I'm top rank I got more lines than the Yanks
Uni-form, carry on screamin on MC's
Running around together only bonded by smoking trees
Chronic, my tonic make you vomit for teamin up
Bringin the drama, be blank comma blank comma
Read it, singers get weeded, then conceeded
But you don't know the pain
So watch how you feed it to me

Chorus

Verse Three:

Comin with with the raw tech, strong like Gore-Tex
Rappers get more plex, as they make their name off all fetch
And unrealistic, your neighbor crew know you're ballistic
Your statistic ain't mistic, under that talk we know who is it
So stay busy, keep touring
Your hood is roaring, it's not a place for pussycats to be exploring
Your plan lock it, you bandwagon just to start a rival
Without skills you better check for your own survival
And feel the pain rappers talk a good John Wayne but look stupid
You be trying to play us like a groupie
With your rap staff you riff and raff
I listen and laugh, in town you down out of town you get sent ass
And you don't know the pain...

[Intro: Nas]
Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know

[Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin'
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin', fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

[Hook: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that!)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Verse 2: Nas]
The way to be, paradise like relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange deranged
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controllin', click rollin'
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

[Hook: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that!)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

[Bridge]
And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

[Verse 3: Nas]
You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?

[Hook: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that!)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

Boom biddy bye bye
Boom biddy bye bye

Step back as I'm kicking up dust
For a while
As I put mothafuckas to rest
And pull their files

Out from the cabinet
With the picture
Get the 45 and settle it
With this punk nigga

Slow your roll
As I take control
Take your toke from the Indo'
Then hit and hold

Now let it out
How you feel when the herb
Got you by the balls
And you're coughing up a lung anyhow

You can't shake
That nigga that's gonna brake
Fool
On any one member of your bitch crew

As I pull the trigger
On my nine
Say goodnight nigga
Boom biddy bye bye

[Hook]
Boom biddy bye bye
Put your ass on the floor an' don't ask why
Boom biddy bye bye
I put my Glock to your dome and you started to cry
Boom biddy bye bye
Any last prayers before you die
Boom biddy bye bye
Rock-a-bye nigga boom biddy bye bye

You ain't never caught a rabbit
So you ain't no friend of mine
It's a habit
Barkin' up your tree with my nine

Keep your bitch on a leash or at home
A nick knack
Paddywack
Give the dog a bone
The raw dog
Fuck a law dog
Still handin' out beat-downs wit' my sawed-off
Cause a every now and then I got to knuckle up
Buckle up
Chin checking
It's on I reckon
It's the wild wild west
Get your 40 and your blunt and your Glock and your bulletproof vest
Let me guess
Everybody wanna test
Everybody burning up, gonna get burned like Ses
Lodi Dodi
We're fucking everybody
Boom biddy bye
Sing the lullaby
In the party

[Hook]

Yes yes ya'll
To the beat ya'll
Watch a punk slipin' see the puta fall
I'm buck-loody
Looking for the nigga who wanna cut me
Cause the nigga gets so funky
Fool I'm the one
From
The big bad Cypress Hill clique, a
Number one son of the funk freaka
Yes yes ya'll
I'll be the one with the mad Buddha blast ya'll
Comin' from the west ya'll
But I figure
You'd cry like a bitch
Don't twitch
Cause I just might pull the trigga
Now lay down
Stay down
Don't move a muscle if you see your homeboy's brains on the ground
Don't fuck don't say nothin'
You fuck around and I might get ragamuffin
Boom biddy bye bye
Line up on the floor now you' all gonna die

[Hook](2x)

Boom biddy bye bye
It's time to die
Boom biddy bye bye
Time to say good-bye

Boom biddy bye bye
Now it's time to die
Boom biddy bye bye
Now it's time to die

Word life boo, I checked you flexin wit' cha crew
Lookin sweet enough to chew wit them saint eyes like tha brew
Roughneck mannerism, fly disposition
Ya live like channel sparkin' like mad-izm
My mission, is gettin into you like a religion
My woman's intuition tells me cupid's arrow's hittin
You're the prince with the glass slipper that my foot could fit in
This feelin that I have is never endin, I'm sendin
My love like Zhane' up in a box
With the bow up on the top, cause, for you I got the hots so
Please accept these words that I posess I'm like a damsel in distress in
Pursuit of happiness, I confess

[Hook:]
I've been really tryin' baby
Tryin to hold back these feelings for so long
And if you feel, like I feel baby
Come on, ohhh, come on

Many men wit mass appeal expand across the globe by the mills
But still I picked you like a daffodil
Cause you thrill me like magnetic fields that give my body chills
Perserve my chocolate ties and it's a thrill; I'm sayin
That when you swing my way I, get a sudden rush
That entices me not to keep it on the hush-hush
Boy times girl times lust equals us
And you can count on that like you would an abacus so
Bust the equation, baby cause I'm facin the fact that I only think of you
On two occasions, but I'mma max once I get this off my chest, and just let
Nature do the rest.. I confess

I wanna be down like Brandy with you handy for tha duration
Engage in electric relaxation
Build a conversation, probe ya intellect
Put ya manhood to the test, but not just ya physical, ya individual is what
I'm after
Ya heart I wanna capture, I'm open like a space that NASA explores
Truly do adore, every little move you make and more, my word is born
But I could go on and on throwin hints
That I'm tha chick, you should be celebratin life wit
So instead I felt it best if I just
Stood and represented in the flesh that I confess...

How you doin miss? My name is L I'm from Queens
I heard about your man, he like to lace you with cream
Dolce Gabbana, Mo-schi-no with Donna jeans
But he slipped up, and threw his rock to a fiend
He be playin like a Willie cause he dress ya dove
Neva knowin' that his woman is in need of love
You got Versace gold link stomach chains with rocks
Official hair style but you stuck up in the spot
Makin love, Duke is weak then he fallin asleep
You on the phone wit your old peeps dyin to creep 'tween my sheets
So what you got Chanel on your feet
Hot sex on a platter makes the mission complete, uh

[Chorus: Total (LL Cool J)]
Who do you love (I wanna lounge with you)
Are you for sure (I do what I gotta do) (4x)

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
Jew-als and Cristal gotta mack a phony style
He ain't watchin you he rather watch his money pile
Can't protect treasures when its in a glass house
Soon as he turn the corner I'mma turn that ass out
Full blown, frontin in the 6 with the chrome
Yo B, why you leave your honey all alone wit me
Just because you blessed with cash
Doesn't mean your honey won't let me finesse that ass
So see the moral of the story is a woman need love
The kind you so-called players never dreamed of
You gotta try love, can't buy love
If you play your hand, then it's bye-bye love

[Repeat Chorus]

[LL Cool J]
So what you got the cash flow and escro, damn
But your honey ran away like presto, ala-kazam
Man made the money, money never made the man
You still fakin jacks throwin rocks on her hand
See, you put your mack down now you Nino Brown
Rock roller wit' so much ice your cap's polar
I got em smokin beanies, modelin bikinis
Pushin ya whip on the freeway to see me
I keep it steamy, I make it burn when it's my turn
Teachin shorty all the tools that you neva learned
Don't get it twisted, gettin money ain't wrong
But she wanna make love all night long, I'm gone

[Intro]
Yes, 1996 marks the beginning of a new era
The dysfunctional member of the Alkaholiks family
It’s Xzibit!

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wonder if it’s all worth my while
Xzibit stay versatile, with million dollar lifestyle
And I could feel it as a child growing up
The niggas that was real
And the niggas that was scared as fuck
That's why Xzibit only roll with a chosen few
You ain't really real, I can tell when I look at you
So ease off the trigger-talk, you ain’t killin' shit
It’s not affecting me or the niggas that I'm chillin' with
I don’t believe the hype or buy woof tickets
Nigga, you make a gang of noise and never seen, like a cricket
I guess that’s why we never kick it
A lot of niggas is soft and get tossed tryna fuck with the Likwit
How many niggas do you know like this?
Always claimin' that they ridin' but they really turned bitch
It don’t make sense, either you’re a soldier from the start
Or an actor with a record deal tryna play the part—like that!

[Hook]
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!)
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)

[Verse 2]
See, I don’t need no lights, no cameras; just action, goddamn it
Never no superstar, I'm more like a planet
So my composure is kept while others start to sweat
Emergin' from the fog with my fucked-up dialogue
Tryna live high on the hog leaves you bankrupt
And niggas you spent it on would not give a fuck
And that’s deep; how deep? It’s deeper than Atlantis
Home of the scandalous: big bad Los Angeles
Dangerous, vandalous, yo, not to be trusted
Now, how the fuck is you hard
Not being scared by the boulevard?
I'm pullin' that card, and saying ""Gin, mothafucka!""
Flowin' like liquid; soak it in, mothafucka!
I'm breakin' it down, my sound surrounds like death
From the West, puttin' whole counties to the test
It’s all in perspective, breaker 1-9 copy
This is for the niggas gettin' caught up in the paparazzi

[Hook]
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!)
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)

[Verse 3]
Niggas smoke stress and cross dress, but I just play the back
Others going through schemes and pipe dreams for a contract
Real tightly rolled, fuck ’em all how I feel
I made a cool half mill' before I had a record deal
Therefore you look and stare like it’s magic
But too much of anything can make you an addict
Whenever devils be startin' static, break out the automatic
I set it off straight, I spread hate, then I vacate
But wait! Who dares to cross this path?
Yo, I do you like math, cut with glass, make a bloodbath
So on behalf of all niggas I get drunk with
Smokin' blunts with, I dispose of your punk shit
He-he, and keep it all in perspective
Carbon copies gettin' caught up in the paparazzi
Once again, it's the Likwidation crew
And we return at you like this

[Hook]
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Extra large!)
It’s a shame, niggas in the rap game
Only for the money and the fame (Paparazzi!)

[Verse 1: André 3000]
One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hook up
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs
This shit here must stop, like ""Freeze!""
We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's
And that's a no-no

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac
They call us, went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say mothafuck that playing, they paying, we staying laying vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
""OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise""
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me, I'm out this bitch

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them white girls, before them blunts, got crunk, chunky asses
Passes getting thrown like Hail Mary's
And they looking like Halle Berry's
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, ""Momma I want to sing
But momma I want to trick, and momma I'm sucking dick now""
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82, me and you like Tony Toni Tone

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from
Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something ""Hey man, you remember me from school?"" ""No not really""
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made""
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat
Like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet then I don't eat
So we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

I rock Versace, sippin' VSOP and Hennessey in foam cups
Motorola flips with illegal chips
Dip-pin' like Teela where everybody momma collectin money from FEMA
Five series Beemer, one-hundred and eighty-nine horsepower
I like bitches with dimples and nipples the size of silver dollars
Rollin three deep in Eddie Bauers chokin out LAPD Rottweilers
Like chihuahuas, all day eryday
In Southern California where the dawgs and the rips stay
And nowadays fools don't know how to act
Cause we all wanna be Tony Montana
Matter of fact, gimme five we got dap, gimme twenty-five
We got a bird and profit is made
So while the homey cut cavi with a razor blade
I rock beats without baking soda
And money gets washed it's only illegal if you get caught
Thought you knew cause the DEA do it too
Keep seperate books for the internal revenue
Capitalism is pimps and hoes
In ninety-six I 'spose anything goes

[Refrain]
Big bank take little bank anything goes
Legal or illegal however you make your cash flow
Big bank take little bank ahh anything goes
Legal or illegal however you make your cash flow

[Verse 2]
All you PH Ballers and Dirty Mack's need to KG
I'd rather be a dope MC than a broke OG
I get manicures to keep my cuticles suitable
Player, don't hate me because I'm beautiful
I got a pocket full of C-notes and food stamps
Just big bills and free meals baby so lamp
Cause jealousy gets you burned like bad perms
If you live you learn, I spit game like Chick Hearn
To women with, measurements of 38-24-36 with DSL's
But money talks ESL
In the game of Monopoly, if you don't pass go then go di-rectly to jail
Cause I've seen fools that struggle and turn they ownself into the po-po
It keeps the humble up their culo
Selling ten dollar J's right up under the man's nose
Hahh, nigga anything goes

[Refrain]

[Interlude]
One for the money (money), two for the show (show)
Three for the ladies but all they wanted was one
It's one for the money (money), two for the show (show)
Three for the ladies but all they wanted was one

[Verse 3]
Niggas got stripes like, Tony the Tiger
But niggas got strikes like Oral Hershiser
So look alive, inflation rise like yeast
S&L scandal stole millions
But we need more police to take back our streets, it's drama
We all know that one-time be extortin them big-ballers
Gettin extradited with warrants in three states
Overcrowded prisons hopin the DA drop the case
So uhh, I ain't forgot about the homey Kevin
He pled no contest and got stretched til ninety-seven
Dizmost and Little Dags hold tight
I know I seldom shoot kites but I be tryin to get my pockets right
My ideal real is Big Willie pourin out Dom P
For the dead homies with bitches splittin Phillies (call it ends)
Call it loot scrilla cream green flow or dough
But to get mo' nigga, anything goes

[Refrain x2]

""It's no disguise, it makes no sense
It doesn't fit, if it doesn't fit, you must acquit""

Man, I'm at the light, man
Niggas is mad dogging
I'm looking at the light, I'm looking at them niggas
I'm looking at the light, I'm looking at their bitches
I'm looking at the light, I'm looking at my shit
I'm thinking this shit is real
This shit is real

[Cold 187um]
Yeah
Now tell me who wanna step to the real
As I'm beatin' down they block with my clip ready to trip, ugh yeah
Cause player haters getting chin checked quick
Running off, with the mouth, like the jealous groupie bitch, yo
I'mma jack him for his motherfucking loot
His house, his bitch and his motherfucking Lexus Coupé
Well, if you killed me you can have all that
But if not, don't be surprised who that missle been launched at
Cause in the cell, realest they can't get
Nigga, check your nuts cause you fucked, ugh yeah
And then it's just like you all taking mild
Cause they don't give a fuck about your bitch or your child
Have you all tied up in the house
Dynamite rip your ass with a gauge in your mouth
Mad as fuck, cause you're squealing like a bitch
But they gonna kill everybody, before somebody snitch
Now, everybody's getting hit up
Cause some bullshit got twisted and got messing your fuck
Because you cats playing dumb
Me and my niggas was out
When I was rolling in the Candy blue 'llac on whips
I be the player for life, ride
I get love from the blue and the red side
So lay them out all over my gun smoke
I never slipped when I'm rolling on my 100 Spokes, bitch

[Chorus: PEE GEE singing] (x2)
You got the fliest shit
You got air lines
You look so fly of, so fly of
Of them 100 Spokes

[Hook: Cold 187um] (x4)
As I floss my 100 Spokes there's no joke

[KM.G]
When I bought my 100 Spokes, I bought a four five
Just for a nigga like the KM, to stay alive
Deep into the motherfuckering three, but we call it the trey
Built like Coloride but it's name My Choverlet
Flowing and crowing what I need to
To get though the hood, nigga, or get to my crew
And meditate, and regulate, never perpetrate
And plot on these busters, they gets fate
Legit, hard, works this shit when it comes to them riders
My Anchor got 3 wheel, funk track provider
Rules to through motherfucking sounds I'm giving
Westcoast I know you love it and wish you can live it
Hear something about them 100 Spokes
When they be like dipping, whipping around delight women
Freaking all the freaky bitches when they're like spinning
Above the Law giving it up

[Chorus: PEE GEE singing X2]

One to da two da three da four
Dem dirty Red Dogs done hit the door
And they got everybody on they hands and knees
And they ain't gonna leave until they find them keys

Now if dirty Bill Clinton fronted me some weight
Told me to keep two, bring him back eight
And I only brought him five and stuck his ass for three
Do you think that Clampett will sick his goons on me?
See Martel Homes, that's my claim to fame
That's where I learned my slickest trick in the dope-d-game
Like my favorite, I call it ""Lemonhead Delight""
That's when you lick off all the yellow and you sell the white.

Right, well if pimpin' be a sport I be bein' the wide receiver
That nigga B-I-G will make ya'll niggas believers
Sippin' on Cuervo Gold off in the club drunk as fuck
Callin' them hoes bitches, and smokin' my weed up
When I'm too sober, year older, now I'm almost legal
Wanted to live the life of Cadillacs, Impalas and Regals
Fuckin' around wit hoes, bustin' nuts in they mouths
Kickin' that same southern slang
Lookin' for love off in yo' jaw ho!

See powder gets you hyper; reefer makes you calm;
Cigarettes give you cancer; woo woo's make you dumb
What you niggas know about the Dirty South
What you niggas know about the Dirty South

See never did I thank when I got grown
That some pee wee sacks had been done took dis town
See life's a bitch then you figure out
Why you really got dropped in the Dirty South
See in the 3rd grade this is what you told
You was bought, you was sold
Now they sayin' Juice left some heads cracked
I betcha Jedd Clampett want his money back
See East Point Atlanta threw this road block
Talkin 'bout all this blow traffic got to stop
So the big time players off John Freeman Way
Had to find themselves another back street to take
Cause back in the day we was outta control
We didn't understand, ""Naw nigga, that money ain't' yours""
That's when me and Big Slate took an oath and sweared
Never would we talk, never would we tell
So when they pulled up bumpin' ""Rock The Bells""
We took what we want and left them quiet as hell

What you niggas know about the Dirty South
What you niggas know about the Dirty South

Now that Cobras got tha boys on Delowe on they back
Gipp holler at Miss Ann she said they didn't get the trap
Behind tha black, behind green, behind tha red tint
Dealers breakin off that blow up for those woodchips
A lot of faces ain't around, a lot of folks got shot
Scatta Mack droppin' G's while that Cristal pop
Been on tha grind with Cool Breeze, droppin' pounds with B
Eric Neal is tha coolest from my century
Mack town keeps growing, old school like Charles
Stankin' like dem Lincolns in Piedmont Park
Perry Homes to Herndon Homes, to all tha Homes
Adamsville to Poole Creek, shit just don't sleep in tha Dirty South

One to da two da three da four
Dem dirty Red Dogs done hit the door
And they got everybody on they hands and knees
And they ain't gonna leave until they find them keys

See powder gets you hyper, reefa makes you calm

I said I'm deep down and dirty, I grew up hella early
Can you feel me?
I said I fantasize about tha dreams, havin' big fancy things
Can you feel me?
I can still remember when I stole my first diamond ring

[Verse 1]
O.K., I'm deep down and dirty
You heard me before
But I'mma kick this shit
Like I be kickin' in some front doors
Now po-po or 5-0
Straight on that real
Always been real
Fifteen blocks down tha
Street from that feel
But still see
Niggas have got it wrong
That po-po is 5-0
And that is my ho
Come and see me some time
Bust a rim and bust a rhyme
After that I fucked that Remy
Bust a rhyme and get a dime
And lets smoke, choke
Until the break of dusk
Fuck that bitch dawn
And puttin' a penny in my palm
Understand this
I rolls deep in tha five
I've been down with tha five
I gets dirty in tha five
And do a hoo ride. (Why?)
That is tha question
Devils be guessin'
Don't question, stressin'
Livin' in tha ghetto
Hello!

And if ya don't
Ya betta really try to feel me...

Momma always told me
It'd be days like this.
So I took myself to Traders
Bought myself a fo-fifth
And some clips
Shit was gettin' hectic
Check this nigga's try ta wrecka
Veteran etcetera
And I bet ya ya life has never been a taken like, I'm deep down and
Dirty early
But see Pearly
At tha age of three
Took my ass in
Beause my momma was deceased
I still ended up a with tha gangsta
Comin' from tha street
Talkin' mentality, causin' casualties
Don't be mad at me
I'm D.D., pimp playa O.G.,
Born up in tha city of tha O.A.K.L.A.N.D
Ghetto-bound hustla, no sucka, serious about my bussiness
What is this? Now dig this, I overnite became rich
I'm me, not tha ordinary nigga from tha street
Grew up, threw up, to what I wanted to be, and what I sing...

[Hook]

It didn't matta my money was gettin' low, I'm on tha struggle
Whatever a nigga go fo, he gots me on tha double
But solo, cause niggas be bitches and snitches at tha same time
But I'm, a go and get my nine
And find these niggas who be talkin' a hell of a lot a to
These bitches, these bitches who be talkin' a hell of a lot a to these
Niggas who be riggas, but I'm a go and hit and do a diggum smack
And take to yo' ass back to tha future
Smoke super, I'm rollin' in tha six eight Couger
A Ruger, a mastermind like Lex Luger
It ain't no thang, like a chicken wing
With a waffle from Roscoe's, our mission
Is never impossible. Not fo me see, so fuck that old series, you stuck
On that screen I laugh, I'm over mescaline. Aha ha ha.... I see a
Dream as a triple beam, with hella dough from a mutha fucka, with no
Cut bro...

Illegal Life

[Noreaga]
Yo, I was in Ramada, laid up with Goldschlager
Jungle room, cowboy hat around June
Monaga, had the 45th draga
Capone-N-Noreaga, the saga, sega, mega, network and bodega
Dream marvellous, scandalous, black mantis
Illegal life is like my A-alike
We B-Alike, hustle night to life
Desert storm, and cold form on your dorm
Run through, hard-boil you like John Woo
The law we hate, drop a cake cut like mix tape
Spoil coke plate, you buying fake weight
The next day, contemplate and score jake
Jesus, conduce, claim Bishop in Juice
Bloody up your goose, now who scream for truce
Lefrak is Iraq, illegal life contract
Keep 'em back, load up the big macs

[Hook]

[Capone]
We hate the law, escalated war with jake, raise the crime rate
Criminal minds regulate the tri-state
The legacy it never end, illegal life veteran salute
Get loot and stay true, corrupt jake make it happen
Snatch 'em catching oz's, put the game on freeze
Dedicated hustling won't stop regardless
Whatever charges, getting the dough til you go
Observation, direct sale, connects giving, reaching for ceiling
On the streets again, wild born, the enemy became your best friend
Meet the game closer, maped out many ways to get rich

[Intro: Pain in da Ass]
Ah shit, okay, okay, alright
Big man! You wanna make some big bucks, huh?
Let's see how tough you are
You know something about cocaine? Digame!
You kidding me or what man?
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday - new guys
They said they got two keys for us, openers
Pure cocaine, you tell 'em, capiche?
I want you to go over there
And if it is what they say it is, you buy it, you bring it back
You can do that you make five grand
Meet them at the Bodegas, noon Friday
You get the buy money then
Oh and chico, if anything happens to the buy money
Eh, pobrecito
Jay Z's gonna stick your heads up your asses faster than a rabbit gets fucked

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
(Roc-A-Fella Y'all)
Yo I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a big willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter
Niggas can't fade me, chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening with the sound of my money machining
My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it
Six digits and running, y'all niggas don't want it
I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco
Swear to God, don't get it fucked up

[Hook 1: Mary J. Blige]
I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
(Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching four lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
While I play with fire, you burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
Until legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause you can't knock the hustle

[Hook 2: Mary J. Blige]
But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
Cause that's the way you're making me feel
(Cause you can't knock the hustle)
I'm just trying to get mine
I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I got to hot your crew
I got to, let you niggas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though: me
Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it
Good me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us huh
At my arraignment screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a nigga eating, fuck you even

The world is mine nigga get back
Don't fuck with my stack the gauge is racked
About to drop the bomb I'm the motherfuckin' don
Big fish in a small pond
Now the feds trying to throw they book at the crook
But I shook they worm and they hook
Guppies hold they breath. They want to miss me when I'm tipsy
Running everything west of the Mississippi
Its the unseen, pulling strings with my pinky ring
We got your woman. Pucker up 'fore we fuck her up
Bow down before I make a phone call
Got 25 niggas running up on y'all
For the cheese we want them keys
Everybody freeze on your knees, butt naked please
Before any of you guppies get heart
Nigga rewind my part fool and....(Bow Down)

I take ten steps and I draw (Blaow!)
Now who's dissin' the mad-ass Inglewood addition
I bust like a pimple, my mind is illmental
The Westside connects with me and South Central
And a drag from the Zig Zag can't fuck with the Philly's
Holdin' down the wild west like a kid they call Billy
Once again it's Mack 10 the gold crown holda
Strong as a Coca-Cola with a chrome pistola
Now who wanna fuss so I can buss when I cuss
My look bring you fear with gear from the Surplus
Since a teen I chased the green, the crack scene king
Lolos, Corniches and baguettes on my pieces
So recognize these real G's, chase the cheese
The Westside Connect keep it rolling like gold D's
Three-wheeling and dealing is like the California style
But in the meanwhile in my town you got to bow

(Bow down) When you come to my town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Because I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you

Well it's that, Chuck wearing, still sporting a beanie
The shadiest nigga in the clique, who want to see me
As I slide my Locs on let my khakis hang
Westside Connect gang, Connect gang, bing bing bang (West side)
Run away run away or get your punk ass slayed
By this H double O to the D to the S.T.A
Fuck hiding it, I'm gang related simple and plain
Which means I could give a fuck about you niggas in this rap game
Flashy niggas get stuck up, beat the fuck up
When you come around, keep your chain tucked from this
Zero zero apostrophe S shit
Fuck a studio lyricist I'm real with this
Talk the talk walk the walk
Diss me on wax, I'm trying to saw your whole fucking head off, nigga
I'm platinum bound so bitch shut up
And nigga all y'all could kiss my Converse like Sho Nuff

Yea. Ha. Let me tell you something

So you ain't got to clown
But if you live on the west side of your town
Make them other fools bow down

[Verse 1]
Now, I don't push a Lex
Others had their turn to flex, Jeru is up next
All these so called players up in the rap game
Got brothers on the corner selling cooked cocaine
It used to be LaToya and jim hats
But now it's Uzis, Macs and G-packs of cracks
Everybody's psycho or some type of good fellow
But me I keep it real that's all swine like jello
Don't drink Cristal, and I can't stand Mo
Never received currency for moving a kilo
Or an ounce, make em bounce to this fake-pimp-free flow
I never knew hustlers confessed in stereo
Or on video get caught you'll know who turned state's
Evidence, murder weapon, confession and fingerprints
Mama always said watch what comes out your mouth
Tight case for the DA from here to down South
Knowledge wisdom understanding like King Solomon's wealth
You're a player but only because you be playing yourself

[Hook]
With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

With all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
With all that big gun talk, bop, you're, playin' yaself
With all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

[Verse 2]
Now these ladies is looking pretty from city to city
I refined a few I met, around the country
The nitty gritty, it's all reality, no question
Actual fact like tight jeans cause yeast infections
And sisters with good minds, get no respect when
Their ass is all hanging out, playing the bar section
Of the club shake what your mama gave ya, back to the lab
I drop the truth, cause rhyming is more than just my craft
Or a way to get ass, or fast cash, or blasted
Black women, make sure you're respected
When niggas is kicking that old off the wall shit, let em know
From jump: ""Dead it"", you're not ignorant
Knowledge wisdom understanding is the key to wealth
Put some clothes on that ass if you respect yourself

[Hook]
With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself
With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself
Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
With those skin tight jeans baby you're, playin' yaself
With those hooker type wears hon you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

[Verse 3]
Now, I don't bust a Tec, bubble drugs
In the projects, or use mics to sell sex
Niggas, nowadays is all about this
So much ying yang, it's ridiculous
If you got so much cheese where are the black distributors
And these record companies shake em down like mobsters
But impostors, like commercial locks are not rastas
Always faking moves, never, making moves
Asses shake, bottles pop, the government is breaking down you fools
You work all week and give the devil back his loot for jewels
And the steak on your plate is filled with chemicals
Still, brothers leave brothers all battered and bruised
On the streets, won't see snakes on my feet
The race is on, but I won't compete
In this competition, because I have a greater mission
I hope that you listen
Knowledge wisdom and understanding brings, long life
And health, think anything else and ya playin' yaself

[Hook]
So all that Big Willie talk, hop, you're, playin' yaself
And all those skin tight jeans hon you're playin' yaself
And all that rah rah rah, you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

And all those hooker type wears baby you're playin' yaself
And all that big gun talk money you're playin' yaself
Everything all exposed you're, playin' yaself
You're, playin' yaself, you're, playin' yaself

You wanna know what the fuck I heard, bitch?

I heard you wanna carbon copy me
Not possible to succeed
Bustin nigga's kneecaps, cuz greed is fuckin wit weed
Gimme more cheddar than Ellie
No Hillbilly from Beverly
Heavely sedated, still hated and Rated R
You the next victim, and if you flinch you fall
I got that sure shot method Guaranteed to make a nigga pause
Peep the Cars I'm in
Uncountable amount of Benjamin's, Benzes for all my friends
If it don't make dollars, you ain't makin no fucking sense
Get relentless when it comes to stacking chips and shit
Try to take mine to thy nine be the glory
Unloaded at the end of the story
I'm on top of the world, nigga...

CHORUS:

Sittin on top of the world
Sittin on top of the world
With 50 grand in my hand
Steady puffin on a blunt
Sippin hennessy and coke
Gimme what you won't

Sittin on top of the world
Sittin on top of the world
With my legs swingin, jewelry jingling baby
Go head baby
Lemme hit you with some real PUMP PUMP

It's the number one contender
So So Def memeber known as Brat
Girlfriend offender cuz they man's think I'm all that
Krystal in my lap, chronic chokin me
Nigga's hopin we fall off
But we won't, we don't
All we do is keep fuckin it up
While all you do is keep lookin at us
Known evidence is that I dispense hits
And make more house quakes than Prince leavin mother fuckers dense
One of the baddest bitches on the planet
Act like you know it's the funk bandit dammit, and you can't stand it
You can run, but you can't hide
From this bad mannered individu-AL Gal from the West Side
Hit em up
I can't quick stick like the bottom of an ostrich
Hung in your pants
Hotness from your bull-shit
And it's written all over your face
You want my space but ain't got what it takes to take my place...

CHORUS

Now best believe I got more Trix up my sleeve
Then that silly rabbit
All day dream about G's and how I gots to have it
Gotta weed habit, but I'm still on point
One of the most wanted to rock off somebody's joint
It be the B-R-A-T, the mind blower
The rough rhyme thrower, mother fuckers can't see
Riding drop top roadsters, fuck all that gold stuff
Only Triangles dangle when I bust
You see, niggas round town called this and that
Said I sound like the Pound and my shit was wack
Dropped the album Funkdafied and they thought it was bold
30 days later, the LP went gold, and I'm...

When I'm dead and gone, you won't be alone
When I'm dead and gone

Verse 1:
O.G. Boom Bang (that's my nigga), that's right
I told you knuckle Bill will still love you after life
And since your death, everythings changed
The family ain't the same, shit seems strange
I started beef with you, use to eat with you
Sleep with you, creep with you, I got use to seeing you
But heistmaster, I ain't mad at cha
I know some day we all all gonna be up in that pasture
But anyway, we finally got some ends
Princess Imani will be blessed with them diamonds and gems
Just like we always planned, so salute, to ya troop
Tribute from your man Billy Danz I love you

Hook:
When we get there you won't be alone, when I'm dead and gone

Verse 2:
Yo, the whole scenery is packed in, people dressed in black and
The whole place is flooded with tears, I'm surrounded by my peers
There I lay, day after day has been a struggle for the man
But when I'm put six feet under, will my son understand?
This is some, ILL shit, that we DEAL with, because
Caps get pealed QUICK, and we be dealin' with some real shit
It's like a universal cycle, I'm a disciple
You could be left not breathing even if you walking with your bible
So when m body hit that soil and sinkin'
I'm gonna be lookin' right over my son, even when I'm dead and stinkin'
A legacy is left behind, for mine
So he can stay strong, so that he can move on, when I'm dead and gone

Hook:
The way the world is going it won't be too long, when I'm dead and gone
I'm on my way home
Just give it up, just give it up, just give it up

Verse 3:
So kid, don't think you alone, when your daddy's all gone
Cause I won' be resting in peace till I see you grown
Carry on, nothing else could come above you
You best believe I love you, I wouldn't of brought you in this world of
Struggle
There's only two places to go, heaven or hell, well only God alone
Will know, where I dwell, so stay tight, keep your head right
It'll be alright, you'll never be alone, when I'm dead and gone

I be amoungst the fallen members of my family tree
(Baby Boy Brimmer) and my man Spuds McKenzy
Princly Roy and Big Mal, Lameef caught a beat
A cat with that Danzine smile
After I stopped breathing, I ain't leavin', cause I belive in
Achievin' goals, through spiritial soul (REMEMBER)
Death is just a heart beat away
And if you live by the gun, you gonna die by the gun I love you

Hook:
When I'm dead and gone, when I'm dead and gone
The way this world is going it won't be to long
I'm on my way home
Just give it up, just give it up, just give it

Fell in love with this fish who got caught in my mesh
But yo she burned my scene up like David Koresh
I guess a diamond ain't nothing but a rock with a name
I guess love ain't nuttin but emotion and game
It's a lesson well learned so praise is well due
I'm sendin off from Big I, to Kenny Calhoun
And add a reservation for the resident crew
And yo get your bowl cuz we cookin up stew
See them Cubans don't care what y'all niggas do
Colombians ain't never ran with your crew
Why you acting all spicy and sheisty
The only Italians you knew was icees, niggas price me

Now here's the lead, y'all niggas pray to hot rods and not God
While Versace play you niggas like Yahtzee
Crackin jokes like you're Potsie
(When's the last time you had Happy Days?)
Blazin up your herb to escape the maze, but the problem stays
Think big get it big is my motto
You can go and play your lotto, I'll be singin like baby won't you be mine
You'll be pressin rewind, you can never see mine
Keep your eyes focused, you can't touch this or quote this
Style is crazy bogus so you can't try to approach this
Stomp you out like roaches, pullin on my coattail
Like some horses pullin coaches, WHOA your roller coasters
It's hotter than the temperature that's cookin in your toasters
While the heat'll put you deep into hypnosis

Chorus 2X

[Verse 1: Keith Murray]
Now for next to little or nothin' I be rippin' up every function
With scientifical mad man consumptions
With mass productions of mass conjunctions
I display new ways of mc destruction
Cause ain't nothin' better than the shit I got
Makin' niggas jump off the roof and roof-tops
I put the hip in hop and the don't in stop and the clips in Glocks
When I rock box your block
My hypothesis on this is you niggas better come in terms of my vocabulary quick
Or get dissed
My brain bleeds mental complex feeds
Bring it on kid I got exactly what you need
Twisted metaphors to get your shit in star wars
Live forever like Bob Marley just because
The mad matador metaphor rips the hard core
For him and his them and theirs you and yours

[Hook: Keith Murray]
And it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I said it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I keep it jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
We keep it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy
Cause it be jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
And it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy

[Verse 2: Keith Murray]
The most beautifullest vocabulist
Punches phony mc's dead in their esophogaus
My analysis is roughly calloused
You better practice if you want to challenge this
I'm symbolic to the sun moon and stars
You gettin' knocked out the box no matter who you are
The funk phat tracks lures you to listen
As my vocals send your brain up in the fetal position
Learn a quick lesson of mic aggression
So when I walk down the street there'll be no second guessing
Now you can walk the walk talk the talk
Back burnin' all day but your still fireproof like an ashtray
I'm a scientist in the mix like Plyx
Turnin' all you fly emcees back into maggots
Non prop soil watch me bubble and spoil
Punch you Grand Royal as you foam like boil

[Hook: Keith Murray]
And it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I said it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I keep it jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
We keep it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy
Cause it be jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
And it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy

[Verse 3: Keith Murray]
I played the many thousand roles of street life
Showed Whodini that the freaks come out in broad daylight
Me and my crew be tight like Lavren and Shirley
Rollin' through all ya'lls hoods pullin all ya'lls fly girlies
Emcee's always bitch, that makes my style all hard
I role with nobody but God and the Squad
Me and my troops we knock the shit out the sides of dudes
Lettin the OJ juice loose on phat tracks E-d produced

[Hook: Keith Murray]
And it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I said it beez like that sometimes
Cause I can't control the rhyme
I keep it jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
We keep it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy
Cause it be jiggy jiggy jiggy jiggy
And it be wiggy wiggy wiggy wiggy

[Hook]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beamers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 1]
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent til proven guilty
I'mma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real G, I'mma fullfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half million
Without the FBI catching feelings

[Hook]
Street dreams are made of these

Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 2]
From Fat Cat to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Wally moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

[Hook]
Street dreams are made of these

A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's looking for something

[Verse 3]
Growing up project-struck, looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny, getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Yo, the saga begins, begin war
I draw first, Blood, be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws, lay down laws
We taking what's yours, we do jooxs, rush the doors
Here come the D'z trying to make breeze and guns toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
My 9 Taurus hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up, we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts for niggas pop shit
Yo, nigga Noyd, what's the topic? Nine pound we rocked in
'96 strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate, my team'll glow like radiation
With no time for patient or complication
Let's get it done right, my clique airtight
Trapped in a never-ending gunfight, so niggas lose stripes
Or lose life, jail niggas sending kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked, finish 'em off
Well done meat, that said 22 slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

[Hook x2]
Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose next are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
It's right in front of your eyes

[Verse 2: Havoc]
We rep the QBC, nigga rep yours, it's all love
Milli stacked down, heavenly guarded by hollow-tip slug
Then crack down on wannabe thugs, adapt to gat sound
And bow down, slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hitting body parts to start shiftin' shit
Never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
Summon rasta, we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminisce, 20 years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me, go against the grain, you better hit me
Legging me or robbing me, niggas better body me
‘Cause it's a small world, and niggas talking like bitches
Bitches singing like snitches, pointing you out in pictures
‘Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa hating me
All that bullshit, is just making me
More the better, then concentrate on getting cheddar
If shorty set you up, you better dead her, I told you
Shape and mold you, son you, then I hold you
Like a pimp, mind control you, double edge blow you
It'll be I like I'm supposed to, the clique is coastal
International, you local Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, son, I solved 'em
Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like, around the way cops the average pitstop
QB City Godfather Pt III, Gotti, Gambino and Ty Nitty
Scarface, rest in peace!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Yo, the heavy metal king, hold big shit with spare clips
You see an eclipse when the MAC spit, your top got split
Laying dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
Turn off his lights, switch to darkness
‘Cause deep in the abyss is street life
Blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
You's the wild child, kid cold turning men into mice
I was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet
The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggas is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness
POW niggas is found MIA
We move like special forces, Green Beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in '89, the same way
The God P walk with a limp see, but simply
To simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me, you must be bent, G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it's full for so long ‘cause I don't waste shit
You properly hit, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs, claiming that they gonna rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what Black
Here's the issue, it's a package deal, you rob me
You take these missiles along with that
I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm trying to make cream, and that's that
Whatever it takes, however, it gots to go down
Four mics on stage, a motherfucking four pound
Speakers leaking out sound and niggas leaking on the ground
I could truly care less, the God gon' get his
Regardless blow for blow, let's find out who wear hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself, see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point, never diss
Regard shit or forget the essence from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds
Live up to my word, if I got beef, niggas coming in herds
We flush through, your clique get purged

Verse One:

People often see me in jams, and be thinkin I'm high
No that just be my lazy eye
What's your reply to the evidence against you
Your girlfriend found one hair, just one long thread
And she claimed you was fuckin, you claim downtown
With Fred, you can beat that, win that, quick nigga wins the ballgames
Tinted windows is a must on any car, any truck
When riding on luck you catch an empty
Riding on the wave is real good, suave bola
You be playin the low low, wife or girlfriend be like, ""Oh no!""
I seen it with my own eyes and I know that it was him
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
Episodes of Free Willy bring strife in your life
You can flip and use the gift of gab, but don't waver
If you love your girlfriend, then you better save her
Cause the next man is eager, to run up in yours
Be in her drawers, put your girl on her fours
Sometime's the girls game's tighter than a sloppy ass nigga
I got my girl locked down hey that's what you figure
She gone away for the weekend, man she right uptown
Runnin around with my man Boogie Brown
I keep your arms in the air, your feet on the floor
While you're over there frontin with these kids
Your girl's givin jaw

Chorus:

I been doin my own thing (2X)

Verse Two:

Oh you got your own dough, from where I don't know
You hold degrees from two universities
Girl you're worth cheese in the nine-seis
Autos, apartment keys, is it Alize for Dolo?
You got a mind on top of that spine plus the lump lump
Highly educated and highly motivated
Workin girl skirt tight love to hurt
Work to exert, break your next man's pockets
Smell of sweet fragrance, unlike the vagrant
You can pay the rent always and don't be in the hallways
In the bed early and at work by nine
Put on the work force ridin on a iron horse
Bring it home to dad, in one piece cause I'm here
Workout baby doll and keep yo' career
No chiggedy, no diggedy, not you
Glad that I got you, when I did
Cause you was runnin wild with this out of style kid, no class
Light in the ass, white enough to pass
Shatterproof glass for the midnight mass

Chorus

Verse Three:

I had seen this chick at the bar, this sleaze, she was thirst
She want to wet her whistle with the glass of bubbly
She want the Willie Dom not the cheap sherry
Tryin to front with the outfit that's goin back tomorrow
Now she's makin me drink and she play the faucet
Dom she want to toss it, back in that
Jet when the bottle's gone and that's a fact
Give you the wrong number knowin it's the wrong number
Front on a nigga never that, not I
If you see me at the bar it's dry throat
Because I'm keepin these hoes dry
Hey lookie there there's Harlem Slim!
Lookin at me, but then you're walkin with him
I be a little old for them young girl games
I know a lot of tricks but I ain't namin no names
One burnt my man, left his beef in flames
Actin ill wild like the untamed dames
Just came from England where I flowed the river Thames
When I was young in the clubs they played Cool James
Get rich without jail, is one of my aims
You remember Good Times with corduroy James

Chorus (repeat 2.5X)

Something about the West coast...
Shhh... don't tell nobody

Something about the West coast
It makes me wanna ride
Shake it Westside
Throw ya hands up let's riide
To the city of the scene
Put it on the one get ya body on the dance floor
Something about the West coast
It makes me wanna ride [over last line]]
(Repeats until Verse 1)

[RR overlaps]
No disrespect it's all love and a muthafucka just feel real good
Be like what's poppin' on this side of the muthafuckin' planet
Understand me? It's still one love, smokin'
It's just a whole lot more money involved

[Verse 1]
In and out my zone
I roam like mobile phones (right)
Rag top 'Vettes Yukons & hundred chromes
Silly bitches lie in wait until the day I come home
While the phone machine kicks
""Biitch Rich ain't at home"" (Ha)
Six million ways to mob choose one
I chose to dispose of those who call theyself foes
Froze like bitches, tuck they toes like hoes
These amateur niggas done turned pro
Can't ride with the hi pro glow
The boss with the sauce
Got receipts to show how much it cost
I dedicate this to the ridahs
Who like to slip sideways
Beware, double's shuttin down the highway

[Hook]
Shake it westsiide (something about the west coast) [over the line]
Throw ya hands up let's riide
To the city of the scene
Put it on the one get ya body on the dance floor
Something about the West coast
It makes me wanna ride [over last line]

[Verse 2]
How many MC's must get dissed
Before somebody say don't fuck with Rich
It's evidential, the presidential slap on the wrist
Who that new nigga from Oakland
With that brand new twist
Don't even worry 'bout it
Watch yo' neck & chest
They don't wanna get
Elliott like Mr. Ness
Known for flippin' scripts sick duets & mic' rips
But now I'm off the hook don't trip
Hookers throw yo' skirt up
Crookas' throw yo' turf up
Hustlers trust her & some of them put that work up
Cause if they ridin' they gone ride tonight
When they hit it we to the next light. Believe it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Thou commands me
To skyball hands free
Sam see I'm havin' some spam hezask me
Through yo' TV, had ""5 On It"" with The Luniz
[Yukmouth] I got five on it
You wanna ride with me
That's when you call yo' N-I-G
I'd rather be
Puttin' the twomp on somethin' thick
Big SSL with Nicki Scarf's within the mix
Still hittin' licks in the villo with cigarillos
Big head C-notes and them light green pillows
Tinted windows V dozen on my Benzo
The rumble and humble
Outdo' versus the indo'
That's how it be'z when I smoke for sho'
West Coast representin' all O. Believe it

[Hook: Raphael Saadiq]
Never do....what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do....what they do, what they do, what they do

[Verse 1]
Lost generation, fast paced nation
World population confront their frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money makin
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man, then stand your own
To MC requires skills, I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin
And roam like a cellular phone far from home
Giving crowds what they wantin
Official hip-hop consumption, the 5th thumpin
Keeping your party jumping with an original somethin
Yo, I dedicate this to the one-dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said: ""Yo we thought we heard you""
Joke's on you; you heard a biting-ass crew but um

[Hook: Raphael Saadiq]
Never do....what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do....what they do, what they do, what they do

[Verse 2]
Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
The game is ill-natured, it's nothing sacred
Aiyyo, it's funny when I see some rap niggas do to make it
A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine to five, is just to hit ya get the party live
I'm Black Thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme saying rent paying life support
I take it very seriously, within this industry
It's various crews that try to touch me
But I come with the beautiful things, and I bless the track plushly
Around the world crowds love me, from doing tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds to send to stores
You take home to absorb and sweat it out your pores
Now who can stop the music running through these veins
Infinitely go against the grain, that's why my motto's to

[Hook: Raphael Saadiq]
Never do....what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do....what they do, what they do, what they do

[Verse 3]
Living the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
And my mental thick they hit my head like brick
As I embark on a mission welcoming to the dark
When I first spark the arts, when the listening start
Open your head wide, and let the Thought inside
My style fortified by all of Philadelphi
My delph more stealth than all the wicked wealthy
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
Then I get paid when the record is played
To put it short ""I want it made"" like Ed, nuff said
Then after that, I'm putting on my cousin Hamed
We let the ladies blend with the dark-skinned thoroughbred
And discover, my level is that of no other
And Roots crew reign official and true while I'm continuing to

Next slit some shit then I sit and puff Buddha ribs
Sell grills in a field with heads that need it
Pour the cuts and oka?, but 50 can't feed it
Read it and weep
Deep like whole bitch grown on
Phenomenon, table one, diamond dusk dawn,  ride on
Tracks from end to end like a trolley
Wheelin’ like a Harley
Smokin’ Bob Marley
With mad, badder than your cousin from the Group Home
Nuff' chrome, stuck fan, leavin’ spots blown
Niggas need to shut the fuck up and take notes, I said it
Make them cats float like boats, unquote

Study long, study wrong
You know lessons get learned in minutes
Keep my diction full of non-fiction, I hate gimmicks
Executives fields know the rules of the game
I’m using sense to make dollars, real scholars bring change
While you feel the funk I feel the b-break slang
My plan is to land more weight than a plane
Fuck havin’ blocks on lock
Let’s meditate in the woods
Come up with plans to expand
Take ov-’ your whole neighbourhood
I’m givin’ clearance to Clarence, I hope the reverend bless my mic
Instead of riding my dick van dyke
I’m too hype but I’m not some kid playin’, I'm fo' real
Givin’ you somethin’ to witness like raw deal
Crab-ass nigga, dig ya, and your baby moms
Never been calm, high strung and I brought the chrome

Shook niggas never get a chance to look

Sunny Boy’ll splash your ass
Faster than The Flash, with precision missin’
Like the marley, lead, and glistenin', my position missin’
What it takes to beat competition, position
The key, watch the O.N.E. and the O.N.E. make the path wider
Can you follow me? Not a criminal, I won’t get loud and rip
Just don’t play me too close, you'll put yourself at risk
Got a bunch of niggas names on my shit list
And one day when I’m pissed, I’ll take care of this
What my mind twisted turns, I burns like an incense
Get on my stick, for this abyss, believe it
It ain’t no misprint, explore poetry out of limits
Fuck a gimmick, if I said it I been it, begin to send it
Back to the drawing board and come back later
With new plans, new mans, new pants, new jams
Maybe the you and yours, come rolling on Satan's Lords
Riding brainwaves like white boys on surf boards
The G, the same as the industry
Don’t respect the disrespect, when i perceive an injury
Twenty M.A.D., lyrically, we be pumpin’ to your parents
And frontin' (inaudible)

Phenomenon! This is phenomenon! This is (phenomenon)
I want to know what's on your mind
Are you in the need of a little bit of phenomenal? I bet you are

""Soul on ice""

[Verse 1]
I was told two wrongs don't make a right but three rights make a left
Act your age not your color, but I'd rather act darker
Mark a page with mazes of labyrinth
Fuck up a rhyme so bad I leave the microphone abstinent
To MC or not to MC?
Beyond B.E.T. and MTV exists me
Origin cause God created man and man created hip hop
I declined to participate until I was orientated
I heard 50,000 drivebys and 49,999 was lies
No surprise, as the sun rises, thine eyes have seen the light
But we stalk the night, I expose like an overbite
In limbo I lamp, rape the lady kill the tramp
The wrong action for the right motive, so now
Give me 50,000 black angry role models
Take me to DC I'll throw the first fuckin' bottle
Cause I don't give a fuck about a menial existence
And I don't give a fuck about nonviolent resistance
Civil rights will not suffice
In the name of Jesus Christ they got my soul on ice

Subzero catching fatalities to my spirituality
Smoke like a chimney, drink like a Kennedy
Still no remedy
Fuck shooting a fair one
Cause open cuts from fuckin' some nigga up
Can lead to contracting HIV positivity
You never know who got traits of femininity
What agwan, pussy wool blood clot
And deal with the bullshit batty-boy business fi' dat
You play the villain
There will be another soundboy killin'
Benadryl pumps through my adrenaline
Feelin' my raps weight, I track Heavy like Tony Dofat
Hip hop is 2% milk but mostly no fat
And most MCs ain't prepared
So what I say goes over your head like pubic hair
In 1999 (flip the script) triple six
One world government ""Novus Ordo Seclorum""
Check your dead president, represented on the one dollar bill
And if Clinton was the answer it was a stupid question
My soul's on ice, baby

[Hook]
""soul on ice"" (x25)

Who am I? The MC, la-di da-di
I don't wear Versace, I wear DJ's out quickly at the party
Who am I? If you're like me hip hop is in your body
Who am I? THE MC!
When the jam is slow and you need a proceeder
Who am I? THE MC!
When you need a lyrical leader wit oratorical triple features
Who am I? THE MC!
When you need to rock your 3000-seat arena, best believe, uh
Who am I? THE MC!
When you need to get the word on the street wit demeanor
Who am I? THE MC!
I beg thee, let me splurt rhymes, I have plenty
Who am I? THE MC! Lord have mercy

Always New like Jersey, stay thirsty
Who am I? THE MC!
Showin my authority, superiority
An artistic minority, now you startin me
Cuz party philosophy can only be carried out by

Her Infinite Power Helps, Oppressed People sent me to tell you
If you truly study lyrical flows and stay on your toes you will be

And as an MC you will study verbal magic
But watch what you say cuz you'll attract it
Control your subconscious magnet from pullin in havoc
Who am I? The MC!
Non-stoppin' MC, hip hoppin MC
Verbal rockin', head knockin', quick droppin' MC
I laugh cuz I mastered the craft MC
In sound clash I'm the first and last MC
It's sort of like Jim Carrey throwin' that Mask to me
I black out and wake up to catastrophe
3 MC's dead from the sound blowin' out massively, wow!
Who am I? The MC!
Untouchable, can't be caught off guard with fast tracks or slow tracks
Ass cracks get waxed to the max, MC's pack raps for all tracks
Indigenous cultures, Asians, Whites and Blacks
Never missed it the linguistic of
Who am I? THE MC!
Meta-lyrical poetic mystic MC
Hearin the voice of an ancient spirit MC
Premeditated worder
Killin negative concepts out the mind of the observer MC
You deserve a break from counterfeits, frauds and fakes
Claimin to be an MC for heaven sakes
Well, this MC done raised the stakes
Under the stress from KRS
Contracts and mental gats are bound to break
Who am I? THE MC! Again, the MC!
Conduct yourselves properly MC...

You ready to get drunk as fuck? (Whateva man)
You, you sayin somethin? (Whateva man)
Ayo (Whateva man)
(I can feel it)
Check it, Kool V

(I keeps it bangin, keep it swangin, Mike type of sangin)
Ooh la la la (So what ya sayin)

[Verse 1: Redman & (Erick Sermon)]
Yo, I'm smokin herbals 'til it hurts you
I keep your daughter way out past her curfew, hard far from commercial
(So what cha mean nigga) We don't give a fuck when we smoked out
In the land that's doped out (It's like that?) no doubt
From this bomb weed, I cop from the streets
Get you open like buttcheeks, from girls who be freaks
Ayo, can I be SWV? You the One nigga
Rap Shogun, yes E the one
Yo, I'm rolling with a forty pack of niggas
Get my weed from Branson cause his sack's bigger, yo give me dap nigga
What I clap lyrically tap call back
Ferocious causing comatoses to collapse
So chinky eyed I see people waving on a map
I make it hotter than your thermostats
Bomb MC's with rough megahertz so call me
Funk Doctor verbal starburst, lyrical expert
Your boombox better form a union
Cause I leave your circuits overworked, word bond
Niggas front like they want it
But I be in the five hundred with E steadily getting blunted
Damn nigga you cool at what you spitting
So why you holding the blunt so long politicking
Huh, I ace them blunts with the technician of electrician
I don't got a pot to piss in but still spend my last on hydroglycerin
I keep it live no jive rolling Dutches
That's Masters like the Furious Five
I, keep your crew chinky eyed, for bitches actin dog
(Can you hit it from the back?) Why not, while we toke on this

[Hook]
(I can feel it)
(I can feel it)
(I can feel it)
Yo, you ready to roll this weed up? (Whateva man)
You ready to knock this nigga out? (Whateva man)
Yo, you ready to get this chedda? (Whateva man)
You ready to start this shit off? (Whateva man)
(I can feel it)

[Verse 2: Redman]
I smoked with a lot of college students
Most of 'em wasn't graduating and they knew it
You know the weed slang? Yeah boy I speak it fluent
I light your college dorm with my entourage from Newark
Bigger they come, harder they fall
That goes for, knuckleheads MCs, pussy walls and all
I lit my first L before I started to crawl
I got my ass whupped when I had my first brawl
But things changed since I was twelve years old
I specialize in wreckin mics and area codes
Now, PPP the kinda niggas that'll bug with ya
Smoke bud with ya, later on stick a slug in ya
Everything that's light green ain't the bomb bitch
I got different forms to make you lose your calm bitch
Read my lips, you ain't hitting unless you got
Ten on it, get on it, or get the fuck out my cypher

[Hook]
(I can feel it)
You ready to roll this weed up? (Whateva man)
You ready to rob this nigga? (Whateva man)
(I can feel it)
You ready to fuck bitch? (Whateva man)
You ready to guzzle this liquor? (Whateva man)

You know we get down, you know we get down

Verse One: Tracey Lee

Hey this is how we get down with no question
Trees in the V.I.P. section, Big Sun sippin on French Connections
Dashin, decked in the latest fashions
Flashin, niggas spendin tax free cash, ten G stash
Son leavin the club scene smashed, hah
Ass in abundance, run with a sick type
Click with mics get in your shit life
So better make sure your shit's tight
When I bomb, shit is worldwide like dot.com
Known to rock swarms, get up in that ass like
Dong Strongarm in the place at alarming rates
Got a fifth and that's all it takes
For me to flip won't slip
Try to front on and get your fronts chipped
Runnin chicks home in plush whips, get a duck sick
Let it be known we got a song that don't quit

Chorus: Tracey Lee and crew

And every hoe that my crew know

You know we get down, you know we get down

Verse Two: Tracey Lee

Yeah this is how we get down with no question
Run up in a chicken's midsection, boom I rock on
From marathons to quick sessions
Menage-a-trois, killin your whole crew
With at least sixteen bars like MC's supposed to
A real MC, take you, to School like D
I'm Kool like G, in Rap, I use the mic, to rule like a pharoah
Dipped in my Nike apparel, you know we get down
Bad to the bone like marrow chicks
Crack your boom, Tray gets played from the plat the greatest tune
Philly's in here, been here, lyrics they win here
Why did you go there?  I swear
RNF tears the things like that
We breakin your team up like a salary cap, and it don't stop
Until I get the cream like Shaq
Seventeen mil annual, flammable

Chorus: Tracey Lee and crew

And every hoe that my crew know
Like Tasha, Yvette, or Sha-See

Ohhhhh yeah, it's party time, havin a party, c'mon
(repeat 2X)

Verse Three: Tracey Lee

So with no question, hey, lyrics get etched in
Stone destined to be, y'all niggas Jonesin
A threat when, in the zone get protection
Duke the best in, my profession
When I ride loops like a stretch Benz, heads get laced
D-Dot keep the chrome cocked, just in case
Tracey Lee rocks son I'm chosen
Whenever we got this party scene live it's frozen
Whoaaa, time to close in on those who be dozen
Not tryin to hear it, without wine and spirit
Shows continue to blow the venue
With flows that's sicked than influ-enza
Roll with a squad that injures pretenders
I'm pullin your card, so surrender
Bombard your agenda, at last RNF stash
With more pitch slaughterin, so we be the new world order in

Chorus: Tracey Lee and crew

And everywhere that my crew go
And every hoe that my crew know
And every show that my crew blow
You know we get down, you know we get down

Multiply, kill a cop

You got beef, I got beef

[Noreaga]
Yo niggas tried to shit on me and make history, supposedly
I was the man who was supposed to be
The head of the clique
Lip sealed, no nigga snitch
Do or die, I smoke bogey, sword like shinobi
Shoot up your block and make you know me
You ain't ready yet, slow down and recollect
Stay in the car, Astaghfiru 'lah bodyset
Ay yo Allahu Akbar, look paw, now I'm set
Air conditioned cooler system, yo, the tec glisten
On a mission, shoot your back out position
Found missing, 2-5 deep in prison
Kid listen, die on the cross like a Christian
So fuck you, plus your weak religion
In disguise, nowdays I cut pies
The invincible, untouchable CNN
Is boldfaced, written in gold with ink pen
Channel 10, we break ten, win again
Kid you on pluto, homo'd out just like menudo
Far from the sun, can't feel the shit that I do
I stand in front the Judge about to lie, plus I'm high too

[Hook: 2x]
T-O-N-Y invade N.Y
Multiply, kill a cop
Me and you
You got beef, I got beef

[Capone]
I did it for the love of cash your honor
Traffickin' across the Verrazano, coke and the marijuana
And my persona, glitters in gold
Unlike them other money getters who stack, turn quitters and fold
Cash and hydro, eyes low
Looking Phillipine, divide dough
And regulate, empire state caked up
Raked up a hundred thou, now we all laced up
What., shining, designer lex pearl lining
The finer wine and, cuisine sitting mastermindin'
Roundtable climbin to the Top Of New York
Won't stop, until we get dropped from New York
Price of coke rise
Jake snatch my enterprise
A million more, rookie cops thinking they live
We survive, game tight like virgin nappy
Feds on our back, tracin' Trag to murder Papi

[Tragedy Khadafi]
2-5 we on a deadline, read the headline
Noreaga blast with nines
Move fakers, get ya back blown in Jamaica
Lay you in the earth and curse you and your maker
I told you fools to stop fuckin with the Mahdi
Arab nazi, blow holes in your Versace
This war's mega, with the arm legga legga
Been doin this, since Mobb Six with Cormega
Gorilla, animal thugs be trife looking, your hearts tookin'
And got blown in Central Booking
I'm mad iller, organized thug killer
Now you little monkey niggas wanna play gorilla
Officially, Mussolini, pump heme
Insanity, temporarily my plea
And the jakes never worry me as long as I'm free
To my people holdin packs, nuthin less than a G
Crime side of life, foul price to pay
Illegal life, trigger trife till we old and gray
When the flesh dry up and the world decay
Reach heaven in a pearly white ACURAy
But until then, I'mma shine to the last sin
Resurrect through the birth of my son, and live again

T-O-N-Y invade N.Y
Multiply, kill a cop

[Intro]
I dedicate this to my man 2Pac
Rest in peace boy
You know it's all love

[Verse 1]
Who holds jurisdiction over my twisted thoughts?
And am I to blame for what's happened off in this game?
I'm do or die about my scratch but I know
This dope game 4 me just ain't the way to go
But I'm still there grinin' and winnin' just like the next foldin' paper
Thinkin' of ways to load another caper
It's a cold twist to know that I can slang all night
And slang all day but never have the courage to pray
Believe I know better but somehow I feel I'm lost
At the crossroads but am I scared to move across
Could it be what I'm drinkin'? It got me thinkin' like I'm thinkin'
""Lord I need help but I can't help myself""
Awaken to the sound of sirens, niggas dyin'
Kids in the street wit no food to eat
Prostitutes gettin' money in they only profession
But Lord I only got one question

[Hook] (Bo Rock)
Do G's go to Heaven? Cause I don't wanna die
(I know it's wrong and I know what's right)
But if so I'd like to know do G's go to heaven? (3x)
(Will I get to heaven if I die tonight)

[Richie Rich]
And if I took a life or perhaps sold some dope
Would you discriminate upon my entry to the gate?
I need to know my fate 'cuz now my life ain't straight
But just look it the place where I live is oh so crooked
I didn't shoot that man but I watched him die
And saw the pain and the struggle in his eye and didn't cry
So when I start to hear the thunder
Are you takin' me under or is my sin just as bad as the gunner?

[Hook]

[Richie Rich]
[bridge]
For every time I walked by, and every time I got high
For every man I watched die
Lord I need to know do gs get to go?
For all the women that I ran through
And those that I did and didn't plan to
For every scam I ran my hands through
Lord I need to do gs get to go?

And if they get to go, when its time to meet my maker
Will he understand that I am only a man
Flesh and bone born to live and die in the zone
And gets loney trying to make it on ya own
And when my baby crys my intentions are to feed
And fufill tha needs of my one and only seed
And if I rob and steal let it read in my will
""Payback from tha ones that who fell victims to my guns""
On tha run but knowin I can't hide
Why do I feel tha way I feel inside?
Its like my soul is leavin me
Are you decieving me ? I hear voices, sayin believe in me
Is it you? I hear theres a man named god
That can fix it, when its twisted
I'm not sayin I'm all that bad but I can use a lil help
Cause at times I can't help myself

[Hook]
Do G's go to Heaven? Cause I don't wanna die
But if so I'd like to know do G's go to heaven? (6x)

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
I'm gettin' dizzy as the world keeps spinnin' like a Frisbee
Gangstas and girls make the world twirl
No hesitation I can run a nation from incarceration
30 years is what I'm facin'
But give me 7 seas and 11 G's
I make enough cheese to bring wall street to its knees
Nigga please I got enough guns
To fill the empire state building full of 1's
Go to school is what you tell us
But niggas in school is scared of the Goodfellas
We got the Yayo you can just say no
But nobody makes a fuckin' move until I say so
That's how it is and that's how it's gonna be
Kids when you grow up who the fuck you wanna be?
Like me ya black superhero
Got enough zeros to hire Bob Shapiro
Ya honor I'm have to get rid of ya
Because it ain't no trivia about my flat in west Bolivia!
Blew the jury a kiss they rather dismiss
Than swim the big fish
YOU fuckin' guppies!!!!!!!!

[Hook]
Gangsta's make the world go round

[Verse 2: W.C.]
Not just saggin', wavin' my flag and
Never will I ease up nigga, so stop askin'
See I was taught as a tiny locin' on the set
It's all about the pussy and money fuck the rest
Nigga what tech is quicker to collect when I'm seekin'
All the jewelry and the money, so miss me with that preachin' teachin'
Fuck all that bullshit I want to Slang yay like Noriega
Sit back watch my paper
Collect like the I.R.S
As I kick it with 50 bitches all on my dick just like the President
And like the police I want a gang of killers all on my Side
That's down to lie more crooked that St. Ides rip ride
On my behalf as I call shots, as if I was Saddam Hussein
Jackin' motherfuckers for Dana Danes
Hated by many but I don't care because I rather be feared than loved
With a pocket full Of dubs
Cause gangsta gangsta's, make the world go round
And if you want a piece then you best to be down
So quit, chastisin' me, analyzin' me
You like the escorts look over your shoulder nigga was plain to see
Crooked ass cowards

[Hook]
Gangstas make the world go round

[Verse 3: Mack 10]
360 degrees like my D's the world be spinnin'
Nigga's been sinnin' since the beginnin'
History's a trip so I peep when I am readin'
Nigga's probably grew weed in the garden of Eden
Before big ballin' six cars and loot
Its like bitches been scandalous bitin' forbidden fruit
But gangsta's don't deal with that shit, on the Westside
And since they regulatin' hoes I roll with the best side
So check it as my lifetime is tickin'
Comin' up strong lickin' and flippin' chickens
Need cheese in amounts of G's
I gave up sports to slang Key's
But blamed it on my Knees
Make sure I got what I need to make up your order
Everything from baggies triple beams to jugs for my water
Like a snitch life's a bitch, a world full of drama
Drug paraphernalia being found by my momma
Trauma brings the sad song, you momma seems just searched your ass you on your way to killa king nigga
So now I stand, with heat in hand
For my whole life span, cause evil lurks the land
Plus I got a packet with this gang-bang jacket
Gotta hold it keep it loaded devoted, since quoted
Fo sho One-0 got the ups on these prankstas
While my world keep twistin' as a Westside, gangsta
FO' LIFE NIGGA

[Outro]
Gangstas make the world go round
Westside is the best side
Gangstas make the world go round
Hittin' vicks for the '96 nigga
Gangstas make the world go round
Westsiiide!
Gangstas make the world go round
Ice Cube I'm the don of [?]
Gangstas make the world go round
Dub-C put it down with this connection
Gangstas make the world go round
Mack 10 straight stompin' and chicken hookin'
Gangstas make the woOOrld go round

957,9622,Warren G,I Shot The Sheriff,23,1997-03-15,"

--Chorus--
I shot the sheriff
--Chorus--

Verse One:

I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable
He mistaked me for somebody who was liable
To more than many murders
LA's a war fields
We keep making war shields
Streets keep souls
Young brothers lose control
I seem to maintain through this
Watch where you kick it they'll put you in a twist
And it ain't nobody like my down ass hommie
And tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me
I keep away from fools
They do crime and  attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

--Chorus--

Verse Two:

They tryin' to stick with some bullshit that I did not do
You know who
The boys in blue
There they go with they assumpitons
Slaverys over let us have somethin'
Why you wanna pull me over?
Cuz I'm bumpin?
I just made a new song
My profession is music
Your profession is protection with gats

Then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today
So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

--Chorus--

Verse Three:

I shot the sheriff
I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to
Cuz in this game they always tryin' to blast you
And leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder
They harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man
The hommie day-dog got strapped but thats okay
Cuz I'm gonna work for life
So he can see another day
A hommies a hommie
A fake is a snake
Straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake
So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

Where there's no one left (Buku, buku! Alla de massive)
But the very best (Klaka, bo bo, BDP crew, bo bo bo bo)
No MC can test *cut and scratch of KRS saying ""but one""*
Step into a world, where hip-hop is me
Where MC's and DJ's
Build up their skills as they play every day for the, rapture

Yeah, what what
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on

[Verse One]
I'm bout to hit you with that tradional style of cold rockin'
Givin options for head knockin non-stoppin'
Tip-toppin' lyrics we droppin' but styles can be forgotten
So we bring back the raw hip-hoppin'
Just like the records and tapes you be coppin'
Cop some breakdancin', boogie poppin', and lockin'
Tic tockin', guaranteed to have you clockin'
We only get better and only better we have gotten
This type of flow don't even think about stoppin'
Beware, the length of the rhyme flow can be shockin'
All music lovers in the place right now
That never understood the way that KRS got down
Yo, I'm strictly about skills and dope lyrical coastin'
Relying on talent, not marketing and promotion
If a dope lyrical flow is a must
You gots to go with a name you can quickly trust
I'm not sayin I'm number one, uhh I'm sorry, I lied
I'm number one, two, three, four and five
Stop wastin' your money on marketing schemes
And pretty packages pushin' dreams to the fiends
A dope MC is a dope MC
With or witout a record deal, all can see
And that's who KRS be son
I'm not the run of mill, cause for the mill I don't run

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on

[Refrain]

[Verse Two]
Everybody on the mic in the party sound alike
Until I recite, in black and white what's right
Let me take flight, my style is TIGHT AN GOOD
TIGHT AN GOOD, come is it TIGHT AN GOOD
Old styles I pass dat, slow down on fast rap
All in yo' ass crack, Cocaine? Don't pass dat
Conjure to ask dat, hyper type of flashback
I publish like ASCAP lyrics for hand clap
No past rappin', youth trackin', talent lackin'
MC's more worried about their financial backin'
Steady packin a gat as if something's gonna happen
But it doesn't, they wind up shootin they cousin, they buggin'
I appear everywhere and nowhere at once
I know my style is bumpin, even though some people front
It's the God of rap, you heard of it
The one that rhymes toward the sky givin airplanes mad turbulence
In rap tournaments, I reign permanent
Don't you think by now the number one spot I'm not concerned with it
The course of rap I'm turnin' it
Back to that good old fashioned way of getting cash money by earning it
No bogus hocus pocus, I bring back to focus
Skills if you notice my position is lotus
Now quote this, MC's are just hopeless
Thinkin record sales make them the dopest

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on
Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, KRS-One, rock on

Intro/Chorus:

You know the time when we rock the spot
Artifacts, New Jeruz, catch wreck and get the props
You know the time when we rock the shit
Tame One and MC El we be the ultimate

Verse One: El Da Sensai, Tame One

We bring forth the swords in rap sports
Niggas play the bench for us, overtime if niggas wanna shine
Divine with the intricate shit, who wanna bring it
To the table able now it's stable on the disc

The Heineken bottle catcher, drops ya, slasher
Dat's the the bastard with the fastest ass capture
No moonwalk, my tune's talk all by they fuckin lonely
Phone me home I'm in the middle like I'm Monie (E.T.)
Love to do dubs on deck without a mic check
Collect no checks (huh) but catch wreck on sets
(Deuce deuce nigga! What? L.O.D. too)
Deuce deuce is loose PPP represent see
Def Squad, Boom Skwad, and Artifacts make three
Like Dennis Scott droppin one for the wisdom
Cause when I gets em, I'll be fuckin up they system
Altar bitches cheer when I appear from the mist
Priceless, ice-diss and never see another Christmas

You play Risk when you dealin with the New Jeruz two blitz
Without the use of two clips, niggas styles still be fluid (still)
The cat, darer with the terror off hands (hah!)
Without bands we rock spots in all lands (all lands)
Nigs be playin and we stand for the susbtance
Subject's the basement, MC's be patient
Cause all that Russian/rushin save that shit for the dressing
(Word up) BS we stand strong wack niggas we addressin

Chorus: repeat 2X

Verse Two: Tame One

Test me, the best be, checkin for my recipes (mmm)
Mess with me and I'll be drainin all your fuckin energy (boo-yaa!)
Galactic tactics match wits I'm from the Bricks (yeah nigga)
I used to catch a switch from any walk-by bitch (bitch!)
But now I'm to the break like disc jocks, dis rock is hot
Got props and plus bust shots for what I got (booyaka booyaka)
Don't sniff shit but snot hops, you better watch your snotbox
I'll diss you, then I'll clear the air like Scott tissue
The issue got a barcode on funkmode
So now I pack a trunkload of skunk, for the underground chumps
(Hoo-wee!) Cause I bumps in any system, who dissed em?
Watch me back them up from all the way from New Jeru
To Manhattan (Manhattan) satin and silk, kill the best built
I guess the milk was no good, so now I'm classified a true hood
Check this nigga, live on Kodak tits
Or bust a pimp, cause I'm not a boogaloo shrimp
Tame One the Jesus and the Judas
Cause when I hit the buddhas, my problem's manifest is deep-rooted
(yeah, that's it, wordup)

Chorus: repeat 2X

Verse Three: El Da Sensai

MC, universal no rehearsal on tap with rap so
Magnificent sufficient all that tall facts
From the six footer, in slang I be the gooder, goodest
Best put to rest acts that's less
Sub-regular wreckster, prefer tracks to measure
Size up, MC's that need to wise up, fuckin they lives up
Urban survivalist, live with this, closed style (whassup)
Tribalist, that gets, all up in your shit (That's Them, huh)
(Yeah, all up in your shit)
For all reasons, number one you're sleepin
Speakin like a deacon catch the drops my props leakin
(Praise the Lord) Seekin on the deep end, sinkin while I'm thinkin
Of ways, to slay my competition without blinkin (hah!)
The ink's on the sheet with rhymes that are unique
Complete batter, astoundin feats yo it don't matter
(Don't matter) Capi-talize, while I'm, categorized
The G-L to the Tame to the O-N-E

[Intro: sample (P.R. Terrorist)]
For security reasons
I am broadcasting tonight from an undisclosed location
Because the subject of tonight's American expose is terrorism
(Killarmy in this motherfucker)

[Chorus: Killa Sin]
Yo, Killarmy, we the last Armageddon
Prepare yourself now for the 6 Man Wetting
In the streets or in the sand war is on
Now aside nigga, here comes the pride

[Verse 1: P.R. Terrorist]
You can't persuade this brigade Killarmy renegade
On this crusade lyrical murder is sure to be my trade
Draw more heat than Black Suede, I'm the Sun beaming on your dome When the shade is nowhere to be found
All you hear is the unrenowned sound
That makes your eardrum pound, you can't avoid it
It been exploited in your district
The ballistics are statistics fuck the critics
They criticize while I revise my enterprise
Do the knowledge and you'll be surprised
General Wise keeps currency alive
While strong soldiers build with boulders
Forts and barriers, my brain pattern hold weight like a freight
Sharp like ice skates, blow this track like a cellmate
Then motivate, now I'm out of state using my Papermate
To penetrate through open minds that take the time to listen to
The Crimson Tide that I provide, I dedicate my life to my poetry
If it's meant to be then let it be
It's only right I'm out for the night, my life's a legacy

[Verse 2: Killa Sin]
It's like I remember slap boxing now we clap shots to catch props
From knocking rocks on the block to chop the fat crops and jock
I see the Jakes and motivate cause half my team be holding weight
We march across the Golden Gate Bridge, my mind is in the soldier state
Forever real, troops will never squeal, so my Berettas peel
Leisurely and infiltrate your mental shield easily
I'm pleased to be the man hundred grand in tan Lands
Now my Clan's doing tours in Japan and San Francisco
Liver than disco packing nickel plated pistols
And keep my block hot like burning Crisco

[Break: Killa Sin]
Wu-Renegades, deadly switchblades

Chorus 2X

[Verse 3: 9th Prince]
Renegades are slayed in steel cage
I wave war blades at United Snakes parade
The unforgiven law of no mercy, build controversy
Then perform surgery, Killarmy, we meet at a ninety degree angle
Universal star angels, we form the tip of a triangle
Like Egyptians did, I perform inside pyramids
Wu-Tang, a scientist labelled me the last lyricist
For today's Genesis, surrender
Take you on an adventure like being kidnapped by seven ninjas
Supreme marine I move in submarines
Anti-murderer, stage burglar
Rugged rhyme asserterer, put the mic on crutches
Lyrical ruckus, build to destruction, Destructicons
Best to kill in camouflage, Desert Storm
On the battle before I lost an arm
Held on to my sword took both hands like Voltron
Like the master who's imperial, king of the scenario
To all my universal soldiers, salute the general

[Verse 4: Beretta 9]
I come armed with explosive chemicals
Extremely physical Killarmy individuals
The concept of principles that are highly indispensable
My name is Born God Allah came to North America on a ship
And was stripped of my knowledge and wits
Death to all enemies by your own fucking penalties
Off with your dome, I roam through your war zone
With a platoon full of soldiers with dust bones
Ain't nothing but the army shit with military warheads
Tie you up in your barracks, with heat-seeking lyrics
I'm out for revenge like a tribe full of Indians
I break down your physical change it to a chemical
_____ made of wickedness, the black man be original

Chorus 2X

[Outro]
Let it vibe, homicide, suicide

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Oh yes I love her like Egyptian, want a description?
My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can’t be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill boi because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that man fuck them niggas I’m going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw em
With these old ghetto poems
Thinking it's better for em
When they can let they thumb down from hitch hiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call the body
Now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes
Even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They fucking a different nigga every time
They get the feeling to
I’m willing to go the extra kilo-meter
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no good ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it’s real Jazzy Belle

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
See what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
Having the very best of life lots of steak and Perignon
Smoking an ounce of weed and every single day was personal FreakNik
Freaking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, looking into your eyes I see
You weapon and it’s depressing
They're digging up in your thighs
Leaving deposits keep your closets open knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily calling me Antwan
Cause you thinking that you my lady bitch don’t play me cause you’re janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, for running that Southerplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame
A nigga don’t even know your name
It’s a shame, you cracking em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up
I’m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don’t get me see
I gotta be feeding my daughter
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
Cause you’ll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be
Dumb and Dumber, yeah you know what I’m saying

[Verse 3: Andre 3000]
See me and ol' girl, in the black on black 'Llac no star
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Strap, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my
Furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to earl
Cause most of the girls that we was liking in high school
Now they dykeing

[Big Boi]
Having no mercy for the disrespect-ful ones, some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be asking me all about mine
How she doing how she be
I know she’s sipping that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures baby
Hey he, faking it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi use 'er and abuse 'er

Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick to clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3

Bang every MC easily, busily
Recently niggas fronting ain't saying nothing
So I just speak my piece, keep my peace
Cubans with the Jesus piece, with my peeps
Packing, asking who want it, you got it nigga flaunt it
That Brooklyn bullshit, we on it

And I just love your flashy ways

I put hoes in NY onto DKNY
Miami, D.C. prefer Versace
All Philly hoes, go with Moschino
Every cutie wit a booty bought a Coogi
Now who's the real dookie, meaning who's really the shit
Them niggas ride dicks, Frank White push the six
Or the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass, tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rapping 'bout blunts and broads
Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars
I still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment
At my arraignment, note for the plaintiff
""Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement""
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy
Richer than Richie, 'til you niggas come and get me

So get with this nigga, it's easy
Girlfriend, here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin'
For certain, Poppa freakin', not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin', like rapper demo

Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

I keep it realer than most, I know you feeling it
Cristals on ice, I like to toast, I keep on spilling it
Bone crushers I keep real close, I got the skill for this
On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill as shit
Transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch
And then you die, but for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circle us, success – they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light ya life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it

What, shorty? (Where you disappear to, son?) Maintaining
Putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in, I'm living
The ill streets' blues got you hunger panging
Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose you still singing, fool
I'm thorough, in every borough my name be ringing
Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and
Ya feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit
'95 South and Papi on the Hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed with, shit
And all the thorough-ass niggas that I hustle with
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit

What, y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay hot?
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed I'd stop
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got
Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot
Y'all feel me, enough to stop the illing right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight
I'm so confused, okay I'm getting weeded now
I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now
It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do
And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zoning: me and this chick on the L and then we're boning
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning
Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone, man
It got me going, shit

Running you up out of the spot in which you standing

[Johnny P] Let me play with your emotions

[Verse One: Twista]
Well a motherfucker could never control me, only squeeze me and hold me
That's what the ho came up and told me
Now is she bold G? But in my mouth is where the gold be
Cause I be pimpin her like Goldie
Gotta get paid in this age my fingers ain't made
Just to be choppin up confetti with, if it's already thick
You better study nigga if you ain't with it you can get it
Cause I ain't even on that petty shit
So who the fuck do I competi with?
The rhythm I kick, is like a rhythmly-wicked-arith-a-metic
Pick em up quick and then give em the dick, thinkin I'm innocent
They up in the mall shoppin for me pickin a fit
I got them heffer's nose red
And when we get in the bed, I be leavin em with rose legs
Stuffin that made em wanna pose dead
But you already got em until you get up in them hoes head
I don't mean to sound bogus or nothin
But it's the bomb when I be havin them cuties thinkin
I'm in love with em, when I'm rubbin em
Be gettin pub with em, in a club with em
Smokin dub with em, huggin em, freakin in the tub with em
After gettin paid from her she ain't trippin
Cause she know she got what she paid for
She honor my name, I gotta tame, here it go
Now we speakin with the game on ways to make mo'

[Hook: repeat 2X]

[Johnny P in background: let me playyyyy, with your emotions]
(Let me play with your) emotions ho
To the rhythm of a hi-hat, take a puff and lie back
Let me stimulate your mind, body and soul, I know you want to try that
Now motherfucker can you buy that...
Tell me baby can you buy that
I got you under my complete control, you know it's worth more than
Diamonds and gold, now don't be bogus and deny that

[Verse Two: Twista]
Now how the fuck you gon' act ho, I saw you creepin out the back do'
What you runnin from a mack fo'? Lay you on your back slow
Cause you know I got you with my lasso
Blow your mind like a afroCome and take a glimpse of the stairs
It's the aroma of a pimp in the air, I betcha notice the smell
It's like a lotus when I flow dis, cause my eyes be the lowest
If you didn't notice then you bogus as hell
I'm puttin women under my spell, like I'm up in their brain
Pumpin their vein with game for the anatomy that's feminine
They're fillin em up with adrenaline, got em geekin
We're speakin approachin up a pimp like a gentleman
Submission is surrenderin, it ain't no endin if it's on
With a blunt from the bomb side
In the right place, with the right mind and the right line
You can get a lifetime contract
They be wise until they look into your eyes
A shorty freaked when she spotted mine
Took her over to my crib, lay low, hit her off from behind
Then she signed on the dotted-line, the ho was like
""Oooohh Daddy... why you doin me like this?
I'd do anything to be with you, you got me gone in the head""
Ya mind, I don't mean to make a disaster up
Like my Dad to master love
But if a motherfucker breakin you for every penny you earn
Then how could you still show the bastard love?
I guess it's cause I'm cold, shit
Thought you was gon' be spendin me I betcha think you sho' did
But game recognize game, now you lame in the brain
Stupid bitch that's what you get for tryin to gold dig, now

[Hook]

Yeah, this be Hype, the Verbal Tantrum
Kickin it with my man Twista
If you should suck my soul
I should make your funky emotions
Nothin is good unless you play with it
Play with me baby

[Verse Three: Twista]
I know you think it's blasphemy
But won't you give up when she ask for me? After he passed the beat
Since you said I was your Magesty, I had to see
And when you get paid, there is some cash for me, is it a tragedy
That I can get her so gone, the ho be trippin talkin up her love a lot
But the only love I got, is when I'm grippin like I wanna hug the Glock
Or when I rub the twat, or pickin up a dub at spots
Fuck the ho thugs, the clubs, and the phony perpetrators with dimes
The speed knots match voo-Do or Die, Psycho Drama, Crucial Conflict
Be pimpin with em gators and dons, collect the papers and dolls
Player haters remarks will get smoked to a blunt dust
Sso keep walkin the next time you hear grown folks talkin
Motherfuckers betta shut the fuck up, cause we make the women suck up
You insist to be trippin while we be gamin like Don Juan
What up the filet minion, the grey poupon
Them hoes are staked to charm, because we make the bomb
Now I don't mean no harm, but either come on in or get on gone
And let me pull my pouch of snuff
In between your thighs, come take a pull and vibe
And let your tongue go coastin low, now

[Verse One]
Highside to the fullest, creepin up out tha house wit my mug on mean

Ridin hard inhalin', and they forgot that they was trailin
There wadn't no getaway

[Verse Three]
Fresh out the club with a dub

If you is a dancehall fan

For cross-over appeal, you don't know the deal

Never sprung huh? Know my style

I love bitches, thug bitches, shy bitches
Rough bitches, don't matter you my bitches
Gold diggers witcha eyes on my riches
Can't Knock your Hustle for real, exotic bitches
I'm game tight, see it all through the platinum french
Frames with the french name, in the same night
Pull you and your tight friend
Lift your little dress like light wind, hah, then I slide right in
You know the whole repertoire, U.S. to the U-S-S-R
Sexier than a Lexus car
Match wits with the best of y'all the rest of y'all
Is like veg-etables in my presence, check it
Reminescin to nuttin you ever heard, Iceberg
Slim baby ride rims through the suburbs
Funds come in lump sums never ends deferred
Get money like I'm down South Wednesday the 3rd, it's on

*chorus*

Dough to get, more shows to rip
I suggest you all roll with the click, who you wit
Frozen wrists and it's flows that's sick
More O's than you know exist, bitch who you wit

Can't scheme on em, Roc-a-Fella got a team on em
Chicks dream on him trick cream on him
Lose it when dudes think it's just music
Lean on em flash green on em and diamond rings on em
Sex around the way girls down to meet eyes
I'm somethin every girl gotta have like Levi's
Ya quita, me got more, see I ball
You can love me or hate me, either or
I'mma stay winnin rock the custom drop Bentleys
Never eat at Denny's and party like Lil Penny
Can he live? Trick or main chick but if she leave
Just as quick, indian give, ha-hah
Now what I look like? Givin a chick half my trap
Like she wrote half my raps, yeah, I'm havin that
You be the same chick when you leave, leave
The bankbook and the credit cards and take everything you came wit
*chorus*

You know the move's major, never minor
Cause when you a true player, they never find ya
We takin trips abroad with chicks from afar
Down in the grill in the Villa gettin hilla
Never know em at the resort, readin to ride with us all
Checkin out this new wine, inhalin the cork
Million miles from the puddles the rainy days the tussles
Reign in ways to hustle, so we won't get caught
Had beef of all sort but I turned it around
Chose my steps more wisely, I'm learnin the ground
I was so gung-ho when I earned my first pound
Now it's million dollar deals, straight turnin em down
Roc-a-Fella make or break me, til death do us
Won't be in your right mind, you ever step to us
Been there, when I was in my tenth year, went there
Then I realized that it didn't make sense there
Backtrack, show me where the cash at, and plus
Frivilous beef, please, we lookin past that
Y'all can gossip while we learnin the world
Drop the hot shit never returnin your girl, it's on

Beyatch!

We thuggish ruggish niggas always, always
And ready to bring the war up your way, if you hate
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Would you look into my eyes?
Look into my eyes and tell me what it is you see in me
Could you tell me what you see?

[Bizzy]
Comin' through the door with my militia, why do they bring big niggas?
Fuck y'all, with a gang of bodyguards
My niggas is stone cold killas, peelas
Steppin' out the limos the bitch soldiers maintain
Givin' my babies all of my money, but my diamonds steady be shinin'
My gang, you know me. Homies got mo' love
And I'm blessed, when I'm outta my sentence
Pump my fist to Mo Thug, gotta keep the Lord up over my shoulders
Jesus sent me his roll or loco, sober, load a revolver, hold up
Now, buck 'em all to Hell, cause I'm showin' 'em
And I seen that the bulletholes was too much, no luck
Ya get blowed up, all of you niggas goes out
The surgeons say that your body can not be sewed up
Hold up, and wait a minute
It's time for Bone Thugs, cause y'all think that you can really hate, nigga

Chorus

[Krayzie]
What makes a nigga think he can bite my shit and call his shit original?
What's worse, tellin' people you made the style we put down three fuckin'
Years ago
And that's just like a nigga wanna take all the credit
I bet it didn't even occur that we would eventually meet with ya, kid
Don't crash, collide, lock up with the enemy
And I don't wanna say a nigga's name and all that
But a y'all fin to get stomped, let 'em loose
And they heard the news, ya run up, ya could get dead, oh
Uh-huh, hey, we murder muthafuckas in a deadly way -
Fully automatic when we let 'em lay
""Aw shit! Get down, Leatherface.""
Fuck 'em all, if I can't get my respect
Come on, now, put them to rest
What a bloody, bloody mess, but nevertheless, we won't stress
I figured this platinum got you actin' like you got to be me
It's all in your mind, but in time, you'll find we as real as we speak

Chorus

[Layzie]
All I see is this soldier, pistol in holster, givin' you the most
I toast to them thugs
Nigga, nothin' but the love of bud that we brought to the table
And a nigga wanna test, catch slugs, put 'em in the mud
Harmony smooth with the thug shit, mo murda to the fools that clone
Five niggas loc'd out with the roughness, nigga
And it's war when you craft these Bones we can get it on
And I'm referrin' to all of y'all bitches
Y'all know who y'all are when y'all tried that
Rollin' with the E since ninety-three, shuttin'
Shit down in the industry, nigga, can you bite that?
I know y'all niggas wanna roll with pros, and make friend of foes
But we chosen - God done blessed us with His potion
Pure devotion, freely spoken, baby
Niggas can't see us never, stay together, my click too clever
Ridin' through the days of the stormy weather
Remember: eternal, it means for everlastin'
#1 Assassin blastin', bashin' on all you niggas's what I'm doin'
All of the heavens gonna be rulin' trues, when He come
We won't be losin', provin' 'em wrong

Chorus

[Wish]
I see five killa realer niggas ready to roll wherever I go
True to pull the trigger, smother a nigga, put 'em in a river
We the killas, and that's for sure
Niggas out there clownin' mine, you can't rhyme, the style you got is all mine
And when I see you, bitch, I'm goin' in your pockets double-time
And it's like that, you don't want that
Come and get some pap, pap. Wanna sound like?
Wanna be like? Nigga, we can't have that
Why a nigga wanna bite the Bone shit? Platinum raps
Nigga bet that bitin' shit ain't doin' nothin', tryin' to make somethin'
Outta nothin'
Fuck it, let's peel caps, buck 'em all down
Put 'em in check, fuck 'em up with the 44 mag, I'm glad
Cause when you're fuckin' with Bone, we sendin' 'em home in a bodybag
Now, look into my eyes, bet you see a realer killa thug puttin' it down with
Harmony, harmony

Motion Picture
Analyze the Royal Flush'll hit ya
Dominate the scripture
Wild black emperor,protecting your perimeter
Rockin Jew-waal, bring on the minister, sober while I'm sticking ya
And roll a dutch of a indica
Shorty I've been whipping ya for years now
Gold teeth smile on the prowl
My lifestyle
Or better yet my position now
To blow you cats like trial
Smooth criminal
From New York to Quebec
Unbelieveable respect
Plan X
22 ways up out the projects
But keep focus Iraq
Wastelands on the quest
Gettin' deeper than check
We all die, but who's next?
And we go again
My enemies I keep friends
Cuz when I want 'em, I got 'em, and take 'em rock bottom
And rapid fire
I'ts you-vs.-I-uh
Hit man for hire blow the world like a live wire

Load clips
Holdin it down my guns spit
Find my deal wit
Drive a 5-40 wit tint
Yo nice
Hold the strip up on the hill in the bricks
Flush the golden Kid
Wisdom knowledge, still living
Understand what I'm given
A wild life to live in, while we all driven
We sell drugs young black thugs
Who take slugs
Most invincible, gettin' money's the principle
Everyday's an interview
You know who
I'm talkin to the best chosen
Laying on 45th and Colden
Sellin drugs 'til the mornin
Swifter than my opponets
Fuck around and catch a bonus
One love to Ryan Owens
When you died I wasn't holdin'
And ever since that day I walk around double toastin
With two holsters
Wanted posters
Plus whatever's closest
Or die like your man in that black Testarossa
Flush don't give a fuck, I'm taking over

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Royal Flush]
Now past the Hen-Rock
Invest in thirty G's of stock
None stop
Crystal poppin
Drop toppin
While the feds whatchin
They on my back heat me up like Al Pacino
Or Joe Pesci in Casino (Noreaga: Que pasa, amigo?)
Take keys of perico
Transport state to state
Livin' great
Bust around a hell gate
Can the key
Money man
Regulate
New York City, crime state
And bless ya L's be on track to make an earthquake
Now wait
Desert Storm just like Kuwait
Watch jake
Can't go to jail wit' no cake
Cause when I come home I've got to live crazy straight

[Hook]

Word up, you know mean? Dust off the gat, royal flush, word up
Back to Iraq, Lefrak,  regulate, word up, combine that, Royal Flush, bitchass...

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Verse One:

Saturday morning at the crack of sunrise
Thank the man upstairs for lettin me open my eyes
It's a whole new game for me like T-Lee
It's nine-seven now and I'mma stay sucka free
Thinkin about all my homeboys behind bars
As I crease up my khakis and lace up my stars
And everthang is straight I'm in the full zone
Gettin paper every day, it's all I'm trippin on
Cause ain't nothin like a ride in Californ-ia
With the top back, rollin on a hot sunny day
It's one-oh, fo'-sho', and I'm clownin all the rookies
With a pocket full of cookies
And mashin to the backyard boogie

Get yo' boogie on [repeat 3X]
And then we comin wit that

Chorus:

Backyard boogie oogie oogie (yeah)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (it's all about that)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (unh)
Backyard boogie oogie oogie (it's the backyard boogie) [repeat 3X]
Backyard boogie oogie oogie [repeat 2X]

Verse Two:

Now just throw yo hands up high in the sky
Representin where you from cause it's West till I die
Put it down anywhere, take thangs for what they worth
Been a rider since birth, and the earth is my turf
So I bails in the party, everythang is cool
It's niggas in the hood I ain't seen since high school
And everybody gots stripes cause we all paid dues
Crips, Damus, and other clicks and crews
Just gettin they boogie on, hoochie bitches gettin loose
It kinda remind me of the truce in nine-deuce
I'm even kickin back, and I'm usually chicken hawkin
The Bloods shootin dice, and the Crips are C-walkin
Now the party is jumpin, and the crowd's gettin bigger
Looked up and saw four hoes to every nigga
And it's off the hook, got ya grindin and humpin
Cause the backyard boogie be bumpin

(Unh, straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good
You can put that on yo' hood, everyday
And we comin with that)

Chorus

Verse Three

Now it's out of control, and everywhere you look
Ain't nothin but real niggas, the bustas got shook
And everybody left with the whole hustla bang
And Daisy Dukes and khakis do seem to be the thang
You choose or you lose while you conversatin
Enough cock to go around, so ain't no playa hatin
I want homegirl over there in red
Cause Baby Got Backs like Mix-a-Lot said
When I keep my composure, kick back like a pro
Cause Mack one-oh just refuse to save a ho
But it's a done deal, locked up throw away the key
Cause she gonna lead a backyard boogie with me
(Get yo' boogie on, yeah
Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood
Get yo' boogie on, Inglewood, pause
Get yo' backyard boogie on)

Chorus

Straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good
You can put that on yo' hood, everyday

See it's time to pay dues, deliver the news
Like you mass we re-fuse to loose
Rhymes and booze, the life we choose
Fight with the mic like Musslims and Jews
No shame in out game things stay the same
Niggas try to front we ain't with the flame
Never take the blame too much game
In the concrete jungle our minds untamed

[Yogi]
You can clap your hands the hands you clap
If your girl's in the club, it's your girl I'm at
If you don't know, check the sound
I am from the boo-gie down
The Rhythem Blunt Cru, The Cru's Rhythem Blunt
Hanging niggas from his Versace don't front
Got big booty bitches but they ain't for sale
With them big juicy lips like Rochelle for real
As I'm making funky with my man Man Taj
And i gotta get a mil so Shah can make the harge
I'm smart but not Maxwell, the demo's on the Maxell
Then print the jam on wax is a back and watch the waxell
I swell, Latin Kings like gorilla family like damn
Yogi's coming through Chad my man

[Chadio]
Rippin microphones off hypertones are the slow ones
What we about when our flow's done
Bust you down like the last cigarate
Rhythem Blunt Cru we the best shit yet

[Chorus](2x)

[Yogi]
Aye yo I used to begin love with the girl named E. Bridget
Had a crush on Puffy fat ass like a midget
Rollin' with them kids call 'em ""uptown cosa nostra""
Goin' state to state in a hoopta testa-rosa
I said, ""Oh Bridget baby, know you drive me crazy
When I see your body you astound and amaze me.""
She said, ""Yogi bear I ain't nothin' but trouble
Keep me on the low I'll see you when you bubble""

[Chadio]
Yo I want the kingdom, the power, and the glory
The whole story is getting money, and livin' honkey dory
Plenty y'all fall, any and all quickly
Known to turn lezzbo strictly dickly
Crushin like a wreckin ball when it fall
I reckon y'all on a nigga then give it it's all
Just give me some cash cause life is troublin'
1-2, 1-2 lets start bubblin'

[Chorus](2x)

[Verse 1]
Now I'm in love with these two chicks
I don't know which one to pick
My feelings for them both are getting thick
Now am I wrong cause I don't want to lose none of them
Am I confused cause I don't want to chose one of them
It's no doubt I think about my honeys everyday
It's no question I show my honeys love in every way
Possible I once took my shorty to the hospital
She cut that hand on glass plus I love that ass
Short and sexy lips always wet see
I go downtown cause it's fresh plus she lets me
Rub it the right way like Johnny Gill would say
I'm glad you feel that way sometimes we just chill and lay
In the sack I rub her back when we're resting
It was love at first sight my confession
She know who she is can't say her name
Cause if I do I won't be true to my game
Word up

[Hook]
I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to Moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I don't want to let none of them go
Yo I can't escape this life that I'm living
I'm in the mix I'm in love with two women
That's word to Moms
I got two honeys on my arms and I don't want to let none of them go

[Verse 2]
Now, my next one she lives out of state
I mean the sex and conversation situation is great
Everytime I hit town we make a date
And when it's time to chill my shorty can't wait
Now I can still remember when we first met eachother
Exchanged numbers promised we won't forget eachother
Goes to work and school
That's cool
No doubt that's why a nigga went that route
No form foot locker
Shorty lookin proper
She's out to get me can't stop her
Know I had a lover
Yo still went for her
Even copped a bed and kicks on the strength of her
Yo chatted talkin bout see you later
From that moment on I knew that I had to date her
Couldn't conversate long
Shorty had to go back to work
Something inside said that will work

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I thought I couldn't live with chicks cause they be too demanding
Especially the ones that's never understanding, like
Who was that? Where you goin? Who you out with?
Them same niggas I make moves and I shout with
Don't let these niggas in the street gash your head up
Like they can do better than me
Plus I'm fed up
I had to tell my main chick that one time
Thinking to me short
She thought that I'm
Some clown nigga she can scream on and talk to
I had to run her down the line this ain't no walk through
Now who the fuck you think you talking to chick
Your complaining's making me sick
Understand man I tried to do my thing
Yo understand I played the puppet on the string
Like I say everyday be careful my friend
Good things always come to an end
So yo

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
See the moral of this is that I really do care
But I'm not afraid to go there
Very unselfish and yes I do share
You could have your bitch but you gets nowhere
Word, she began by saying try after try
It's a done deal
Now I'm singing bye bye
All I tried to do was keep you satisfied
Never dealing with no others I try
Too many threats kid, gotta let her go
Always in your corner
Got to let her know
As I grab my coat and painfully walked out
Hands about to give, we talked out
I'm feeling pain as it came to an end
I said to shorty I will always be your friend
Now if you ever need me I will be right there
I ain't going nowhere, for real

Blac Haze, representing for my real niggas
Blac Haze, representing, for my real niggas
Let me holla at cha

Let me ride, Let me roll, get inside lose control
Real nigga never fold, money clip stay swole
Got me screaming not really, you motherfuckers kill me
Running game, acting silly only real niggas feel me
Coming up to the fullest,thought I was fallin'
Player haters don't wanna see a nigga ballin'
Dealin' with these niggas, got me pullin' triggers
Pumpin' up gettin' bigger, all up on me like a figure
Don't wanna get a nigga hot, talkin' shit must wanna get a nigga shot
Smoking herb with some old school cats
We go way back. Reminiscing on how we made niggas get flat
Writin' letters to my homie doing five to ten
Can't wait till we motherfucking ride again, don't worry
Nigga chill out, when them bitches let you go, we're gonna peel out
The way a nigga live,we be putting motherfuckers to sleep
I'mma ride till I'm six feet deep

(chorus)
So don't try to tell me how to live my life
Chillin' with my homies smoking weed all night, cos real niggas keep it real, And that's word is born
Riding out to the early morn'
Let me holla at cha

How many niggas on a paper chase, caught up in a paper race
Tryin' to make ends, losing friends to a better place
Living like a villain, player haters heelin'
Lord please forgive me for all the drama and the killin'
Blame it on the Hennessey, I'm falling for satan, let be known for the hard times, all that I'm facing
Smoking weed trying to get a buzz, running with the ghetto thugs
To a young man in the hood, trying to understand
Everybody wanna judge, threatening prophesies laced up with drama seeds,but nobody stops me
Young nigga stay paid, guard your riches, hoes become too scandalous
Better far from bitches, beware of the serpent
Parading like a centipede, full of accuse for all that is enemies
The world is a funny place nigga can't call it
Got me stressed to the fullest, chronic alcoholic
Peep game, let a motherfucker known you all up on it
Be about come up, cos only real niggas want it
Do what cha gotta, but reconcile where you must,cos we all must return to dust

(chores)
So don't try to tell me how to live my life
Chilling with my homies smoking weed all night, cos real niggas keep it real, and that word is born
Riding out to the early morn'
Let me holla at cha
Just riding it on out now, representing for my real niggas
Busting it down for my real niggas
Blac haze representing' for my niggas, representing

Live for material possess, what a repetition, termination of black life
A common expedition, God willin' uplift, going in peace and do it
But who knows, in dead cars. Nobody sure, get to see niggas leaving in an astonishing race, am I hell bound?
I repent, money be straight
All a nigga know how to maintain his cuff, living' in the last days
Lord Knows it's rough,hearing voices screaming nigga; appreciate yo life
A bullet pierce the heart,like a coppers's might
Still rolling with them niggas, I believe it's stuff, keep it real among killers, not giving a fuck
Open fire over chips, I died for my paper. roll a bob, when I rob, when high on a caper
Over miles of air and sea, disproving the written
No one knows I'm problem, keep it real but didn't
Made a record now the motherfuckers know me as haze
Kept my hoes seeing dollar signs, reckon for days, put the wood to the niggas player hatin' my space
Keep em' stressed on a how I stay a laced

(chorus)
So don't try to tell me how to live my life
Chilling with my homies smoking weed all night,cos real niggas keep it real and that's word is born
Riding out to the early morn'
Let me holla at cha

Oooooh, you ain't never lied (How we comin'!)
Somebody said we comin hella high (How we comin!)
Oooooh, you ain't never lied (juss sit back an peep nigga)
(I'm comin)

Verse 1 *(Black C)*

Check these flows we deliver
Makin the hardest rapper shiver
When a killa touch the mic, I'm givin him blows
To the brain like Mike and despite
Them faulty ass niggas who try to cross me
Smel of coffee, cuz it's burnin
I'm gettin that money like Mike Vernon
While ya learin, we teachin, you reapin
What yo soul, see the whole load is gettin heavy
Now ya ready, to pull a lick
I'm pullin a switch
Pullin yo black mask down
I put my fuckin mash down so now
You know that dog in me
Maybe that hog in me
Got me runnin around town wit no love an actin thuggishly
But ruggidly I'm comin
My nigga Ric Roc passed the Glock, now we dumpin
We dumpin

Verse 2 *(Big Lurch)*

Comin, pumpin
Brain waves wit no assumptions
I'm ready to ruin somethin
If you want it, come get it I'm bumpin
Wigs, get split quick, fuckin wit this, you don't understand
This ain't yo average man
Matter fact I'm a buck, buck, buckin
An leavin you shell struck an I'm dumpin yo ass wit precussions
No disscussions, juss bustin 9 millimeters disperstin
And the worse you been cursed, in a hearse and
Watchin all you extersions
Lay down to your knees and your worryin
Evaporatin for purgerin, an disturbin 'em
Hit the nerve and then
We sweet swervin
Back to the hood to get a lil bit mo pervin

Verse 3 *(Mystikal & Big Lurch)*

I'm one of the fresh mutha fuckas tattooed for the murderin
And didn't nobody have to go and bury him

I'm walkin down the street wit a Glock
An my loons ain't to be played in this game
Nigga I'm hurtin 'em

*(Chorus)*

*(Ric Roc talking during chorus)*

Oooh. Most deceiving to the soul. Negros will come from near and far
Juss to find out who we are. We are... RBL. Big Lurch, Hitman, Mystikal
This is how we comin

Verse 4 *(Hitman)*

Now who these niggas who's always frontin
Like talkin behind our back
Scared to confront the strap, we can let it all react
Or we can take 10 paces back, and watch your brains collapse
Or we can handle this like gentlemen and juss scrap
Try and cross me like longitude, latitude
I show no gratitude to another nigga wit an attitude
I gets to taggin fools
Hittin roofs like, Rictor Rooter
You get dumped calls, I make house calls like Roto-Rooter
Hoes be ridin my dick like a scooter
Maybe cuz we swerve
Fuck around wit these hoes on the curb
While I get the bullets reserved
The nerve
Somebody's always tryin to tell me what my title bout
Get served, it don't take like rocket scientist to figure this out
When I emerge, I'm on like National Geographics when I have this
My clicks got graphics like Sega Saturn which is only like 32-bits
Blow you to bits
These pieces is bad for your health
So put a quarter in yo ass, cuz you played your self

Verse 5 *(Mystikal)*

Nasty vomit, mildew, rottin I'm the violentest
I make the most advanced hightech state of the art rapper sound childish
No matter how hard you try, you can't come no where round us
Even if you scream at the top of your lungs (AHHH!)
I'm a still be the loudest
HAAAAAAAAA!
Wildest
Hand full of niggas ain't gonna get hurt
Rest of y'all niggas gettin dimolished
Red peppers and hot tamales
It's the nigga that's gonna be tighter than grip plyers
Cussin like Richard Pryor
I came down here, fixin to bust yo head
Don't try an sleep on me nigga, you gonna have nightmares bout what I
Said
Mouths get busted
Ooh you know you gonna get rushed
Nigga put it together, wiped out and brushed up
Comin from the bottom of sound elevation to the occassion
This ain't no fuckin past time
BITCH THIS AN OCCUPATION!
So fool what you talkin bout, where my money?
Or wit my fist down yo mutha fuckin throat.... HOW I BE COMIN!!

*(Chorus)*

*(Ric Roc talking during chorus)*

An I swam, all the way from the shark infested waters of New Orleans, to
The Golden Gate Bridge, an I've never seen playas like this. Spittin

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Machine gun Rap for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, linebacker nigga flash stacks
See through yellow lines, rock a fly jersey in the summertime
God, magic marker rap, bleed betadine relaxed
Wrote this, coming at you crab ass culprits
Snatch ya ice off, chilling in the back, throw the lights off
Waves, water blend, rhyme flow in slow motion
Thick snare, I'm feeling like a snail in the ocean
What's your wish? Wanna Kringle like Kris? Melodic single darts
Snap a nigga just like fish, you fucked up
Some rich niggas you done test, yo
Select the wrong apartment and niggas pulled up your dress
Style, molest that, Canal chain, nigga where ya vest at?
Flex'll make me wanna bless that, yo
Saddam Hussain niggas, light the torch, we flaming niggas
Autograph that, flatten all the main niggas

[Hook: RZA]
(It's Yours!)
The world in the palm of your hand
(It's Yours!)
Twenty-three million of useful land
(It's Yours!)
The seed and the black woman
(It's Yours!)
Double LP from Wu-Tang Clan
(It's Yours!)

[Verse 2: U-God]
Yo, super freak physique like Raphael Saadiq
Baby love the ganja leaf everyday of the week
Super friends wake up, deluxe gourmet beats
The night is right, I might find me a suite
It's a quarter full moon, I arrive, women swoon
Well groomed, dance hall packed, full room
Lady move, peep my glide, peep my zoom
Keep in stride, smoke the lye smoke the boom
Feel the fumes, consume toxic tunes
Hell bound, species forty ounce typhoon
The ultra-violet scream machine move your body touch
The totem pole wobble, Ark builders, God's thrust
Beams of light, stop ya breathing, it's hunting season
Honey eye-balling down for no reason
Grab her close, play post, wind and wax floors
Never mind the laws cause tonight It's yours

[Verse 3: RZA]
Stop the fader of the RAM, blast more watts through my pre-amp
Them can't stress the beat vamp the shit'll get blamp
At full throttle, hot lead propels throughout my nozzle
Crack your soul like bottles, leave you stiff as models
You fag, you couldn't pull one drag off my blunt
You couldn't punch your way out of a wet paper bag
With scissors in your hands bitch the RZA
I stand close to walls, like Number 4 The Lizard
And channel through solar panels, blast off like Roman Candles
Rap vandals, stomp your ass like Wahoo McDaniel
You cocker spaniel dogs, can't fuck with our catalog
Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog

[Verse 4: Inspectah Deck]
It's only natural, actual facts are thrown at you
The impact will blow trees back and crack statues
Million dollar rap crews fold, check the sick shit
Explicit, I crystallize ya rhyme till you can sniff it
We live this, fitted hats low conceal the crooked eye
No surprise, verbal stick up, put 'em high
Rebel I outlaw, split second on the draw
Blow the door off this shit like bricks of C-4

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Check out my beaver, baby blue Glock in the safe
Seen Dorothy in the garden getting ski row eight
We hold a belt Son, that's my word
Spot a rapper run him down, throw him out in the third, yo check it
I think like the man behind a register
Evergreen smoking estates, Divine and Power made me treasurer
With third down, six to go flash his strobe lights
I'm open, RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts, here's a tennis court for your birthday
The babyface of Rap politic with Sade
Avenging eagle crooks, rock the ""W"" and ""Spiegel"" books
Anheuser-Busch kings came through and stopped your whole Juks
Spitfire Kangols, watch Tony train a gang of hoes
Painful like hearing the news, like when your man go
Ends blow, windy at times watch the room
Sexy girl love the shit out the song, now watch her water break

Why do I stay high? Why do I stay high?

[Hook]
If I could teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thug-n-harmony (harmony)
Then I would teach the world (whole wide world)
To be a thugsta just like me (like me)

[Krayzie]
How many mo days on this old earth can you see
It's a crime to me
So we should get ready for Armageddon
Cause I know God should be ready to roll
Do away with all of the wicked shit like mr. police-man
And duck if you want to pump ya fist in tha air
And pray for the politicians freely; get an amen?
The last days of the last days

[Bizzy]
That's why I get high, that's why I get high
I'm holdin on to my soul
But nobody knows when it all unfolds
Then when I don't go
Remember the days cause I all I got
I go on my own with BONE
BONE BONE muggin runnin through your door
Hoes speakin of the last day its on with the plastic trial
What do you know but I can't go wrong
When I kick it wit my song
I turn it up
Cause you love that Thuggish Ruggish Bone, Bone, Bone
Crossroads what rules the world
Enough to make it where we almost lost those
Who meant so much why wasn't I chose?
But it will not stop BONE
Those shots don't drop BONE
Nooooooo no
If I could teach the world to be a thug like me
Everybody thuggin in heaven eternally

[Layzie]
Everyday the world goes round and round
I see it's a small world after all
Cause I can go met n agree with my fans
Smoke a little weed and have a little laugh at ch'yall
But every now and then I gets caught up in a playa hation
Lord what's wrong with the nation, erase em'
But if I could teach the world to be a thug just like me
You could live your lifestyle worry free
In the arms of the Lord eternally
No mystery, but check the essence of the story
The warrior wasteland warrior so true
Divine, it's mine, east 19-99
It's where ya find'in all of my kind, every time

[Hook]

[Krayzie]
(if I, if I)
We stand as united, but fall if divided
My thugsters the tightest
Cause God is our guidance, they don't need to define us
As killer and fighters, cuz the critics n writers
Backstab when they typing our story
The wannabe warrior, that's for sure
And as thugs we're more and more and more

[Wish]
I got, we got, too much shit to give, got shit to give
Expensive but still understood by the older folks for the little kids
Come on ah, follow me (Bone), way to go, we know the way to go
Follow me follow me (Bone)
And that's why I stay high cause I got shit to deal with
The government and these playa-haters out to kill Wish
Wanna hurt this but uhuh
I got two mo thug niggas you just can't fuck with
Artillery you can come with
Nigga betta let it rest shit (shit)
To the little boys and girls all over the world
The shit that we say is from the streets not for you to go and do
Uh or to repeat, please if we can no more murder
How must I say this, if we can no more murder

[Hook]

Verse 1

Dear love I was thinking how I should be starting this
Mean difference of ways still I can light you like an arsonist
Put my heart in this particularly funny when we start to kiss, marvelous
How I see you in the cut chillin' with your homies gettin' fucked up

I hope you stayin'alone I'm into givin'pleasure echoin' rhythms of my
Manly moans

Aggression of nana I've never had

Herringbone on gettin' my pose on to the dome strong take a sip of
Liquor I'm on bone
Huggin you like I ain't seen you in so long what's up girl, I execute my
Unique approach who be the most
Willin'to learn and try to be like I got some experience if you need a
Coach
Or we can ride tonight and kick it like the homies, who? only me and you
Smoke b's up like a cigarette, till I can only see a silhouette and even
Though you won't admit it yet
I can tell in time you want me to eventually wanna let me get it what?
Get it wet

Chorus
(get it wet)
Gimme some tang and alize let me tickle your body, after the party we

[Voice - 2Pac]
It's gonna be alright, you gotta believe dat

[Treach]
Dear God times are changing and the weather got hot
Over the past year a lot of niggas went pop drop
So I thank you for my life and all that I got
I wanna praise you and drop off a message to Pac
I was sittin' here lookin' at your picture my nigga
Puttin' hash with the weed wit a mixture of liqour
We can't kick it you ain't wit us is the shit I can't figure
Nigga I miss ya this thug gonna miss ya til I'm wit cha'
It was 90 on the P.E. tour when we mashed down
Don't even seem like 7 years passed
Both rodies now homies out the hood on the scene
You did the humpty with D.U. I did the walk wit the queen
Was a dream smokin and drinkin' threw our per diem
Stealin' backstage passes to hit ho's and coliseums
Found hoes to flip up make them lift they shit up
Get it then get up looking to chicks up and switch up
Think of all the times that I rolled wit mine
Male groupies got dissed and got the hell out of dodge
They was blinded when the good shined through they were on you
Just know I'm gon' mourn you till I join you

[Chorus] (×2)
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I hope you here me now in god we trust
Even all the prayers can't bring you back to us
I'll mourn you til I join you cause i'll keep in touch

[Treach]
We was two lil niggas both skinny and broke
Happy if we scrap pennies for smokes
Tours over we were out yeah and you called with the news
You was over in New York to film this movie called Juice
Called you back up you told me pack up
Me and you and Stretch could shack up
The thug luv back up the act up
Shock, Hakeem and  ain't true would call and fuss cause they know we all kicked up dust
You remember when the cabby said daddy wouldn't pick up our RACE
You beat his ass then you spit in his face
I remember on the set from the trailer feens stole your jewels
And Big Stretch punched him out his shoes
Back then I was taken stashes quick who holdin'
That's when every piece of bud I was rolling was stolen
We would laugh at the jacks over six packs and yacks
Spit the emos over demos thinkin' ladies and limos
Youse a wild motherfucker who could never sit still
Said you wouldn't rest until you saw a mill
Nigga I felt you
We was back an' forth borough to projects for forts
Damn I wish they knew how much you loved new york
Shit and can't nobody dis my nigga
Motha fuck that I miss my nigga
I'm a mourn you til I join you

[Spoken]
You ain't got to worry about how long I'm gonna mourn ya
I'm gonna keep your name on the streets

[Chorus] (×2)

[Treach]
I'm ya true motherfucker thug nation alert
Keep his name on the street til ya lay in the dirt
This shit hurt cause we went from poor to rich
You're supposed to see a lot more than this
They brought you up locked you up when you did above the rim
They let you out you called us up we came as thugs again
We WOULD HEAR ah-ha rapist they shout
Ya'll was talkin shit that ya'll didn't know a damn thang bout
You was going through your stress while your enemies laughed
Ain't never take no shit and 2Pac never took no ass
Fuck the press fuck the world life goes on when you die
Fuck the court fuck the judge and every bitch that lied
A little time ticked by, my ho and I got rocked
My lady waking me up yelling Treach, Pac got shot
Soon as I get there I find Afeni urging' me
Saying convince my baby, don't leave after surgery
So I'm lookin in her eyes while they walkin me through
Thinkin Pac hard head what the hell I'ma do
So we kicked it as they stayed and I asked what you need
You say a pound for comin nigga and a hit of some weed
So I asked you not to go over and over god knows
You just smiled and said nigga help me get on my clothes
So we got over that, you healed up got locked
I dropped case about lights, they had you caged when I stopped
Yeah the chain remains plus you a part of my link
They fucked up by givin' you too much time to think
I remember your release and we met up in l.a
At the billiard getting blazed Henny'd out with the hay
After that you blew up a made nigga platinum plus
Addicted to drama a soldier with a nation of thugs
Now we in these savage ages
Even you yourself predicted that last night in vegas
I heard gats were brandished, my nigga once again damaged
And a part of this heart right here in Venice
At the same time you was both loved and feared
M.O.B. the fuckin' thug of the year
I'm a mourn you til I join you

[Chorus] (×2)

[Everybody]
We'll mourn - that's what we'll do
We'll mourn - till we're with you

Right about now I'll be stoned to the bone
Just puffin scarma with my man P. Tone
Got Big Fred makin moves on the phone
So we can lock shit down like Al Capone
Been a long time since you heard my style
Ain't shit changed, still buckwild
Been wreckin mics since Gomer Pyle
Way back when I was a juvenile
Everybody rappin like it's goin out of style
Can't roll up weed hawks on the prowl
Fellas say ho, ladies saw ow
No hump, no pump without creden-tials
Call me dough maker, now with sex appeal
Rock the British Walker, with the quarter feel

[Chorus]
Greg Nice - YOU KNOW YOU'RE BLAZIN HOT
No doubt - YOU KNOW I'M BLAZIN HOT
Greg Nice - YOU KNOW I'M BLAZIN HOT

No doubt - YOU KNOW I'M BLAZIN HOT

[Smooth B]
Who's the messiah?  Was he a rasta?  Kill the impostor with fire
Number one MC, I'm much flyer
They tried to catch me by the cross, they lost
So I teamed up with Greg Nice on the mic, and now I floss
I flow faster, faster cause I has'ta
Some of my disciples call me the rabbi, the master
I opened up the 7th seal to reveal
Every rhyme that came out while I was gone has no appeal
So chill, let me step up to the front and get my propers
When it comes to dope routines on the mic, no one can stop us
Or drop us or rock us, like Spike Lee we be the ""Clockers""
Flavor Flav and all my peeps in the Bronx, we be them knockers

[Chorus]
Greg Nice - OUR STYLE BE BLAZIN HOT
Smooth B - STYLE BE BLAZIN HOT
Greg Nice - OUR STYLE BE BLAZIN HOT
Smooth B - STYLE BE BLAZIN HOT

[Guru talking]
That makes me know that we we we we're doing
We had the right idea in the beginning
And and we just need to maintain our focus and elevate
We what we do we update our formulas
We have certain formulas but we update em (oh right)
With the times and everything y'know
So y'know the rhyme style is elevated
The style of beats is elevated but it's still Guru and Premier
And it's always a message involved

[Intro]
The real (The real)
Hip-hop (Hip-hop)
MCing(MCing), and
DJing (DJing), from your own mind (from your own mind,)
You know? (you know?)
I, I guess right now we should start the show

[Verse 1: Guru]
Who's the suspicious character
Strapped with the sounds profound
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome, like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
‘Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
‘Cause I'm like the Wizard, and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hitting like some double Desert Eagles
Sporting caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtracting all the rappers who lack
Over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whoop ass
Dropping lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolving, on its axis
I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this
So many people searching for false bliss
I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sort of like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez

[Hook]
You know my steez
Let 'em know, do your thing, dog
Keep it live (Keep it live,Keep it live)
To the beat y'all

[Verse 2]
The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacing the wax
I be bringing salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feeling more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines take flight
The apparatus gets blessed
And suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure, I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreading like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid
But still can't make the fucking grade
How many times are wannabe's gonna lie?
Yo, they must wanna fry
They can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness, carrying my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort
(You know my steez)
You know my steez

[Hook]
Let em know, do your thing y'all
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing y'all
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing y'all
Keep it live (Keep it live)
You know my steez
Let em know, do your thing y'all
Keep it live (Keep it live)
The mic

[Verse 3]
On the microphone, you know that I'm one of the best yet
Some punks ain't paid all of their debts yet
Trying to be fly, riding high on the jet-set
With juvenile rhymes, making fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out you be like, ""Damn, he flipped!""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip, it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick  why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a frigging riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas
Yo, them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse, you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche
In this rap shit, you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon
Your song's pathetic, synthetic, like Rayon
Fat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on
Word is bond
You know my steez

Spell my name right, B-I, double-G, I-E
Iced out, lights out, me and Cease-a-Leo
Getting head from some chick he know
See it's all about the cheddar, nobody do it better
Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather
Women and the weed - sticky green
No seeds bitch please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the hood, ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up, you drunk them licks up
Mad cause I got my dick sucked
And my balls licked, forfeit, the game is mine
I'ma spell my name one more time, check it

I live out there, so don't go there
But that don't mean a nigga can't rest in the West
See some nice breast in the West
Smoke some nice sess in the West, y'all niggas is a mess
Thinking I'm gon stop, giving LA props
All I got is beef with those that violate me
I shall annihilate thee
Case closed, suitcase filled with clothes
Linens and things, I begin things
Beeper start to flash, 818's, 213's
313's, B.I.G

Scream Biggie Biggie gimme One More Chance
I be whipping on the freeway, the NYC way
On the celly-celly with my homeboy Lance
Pass hash from left to right
Only got five blunts left to light
I'm set tonight
Met a bitch at the Versace store
Said she suck it 'til I ain't got no more, only in L.A
Bust on bitches be-lly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then fuck your man
What's your plan, is it to rock the Tri-State
Almost gold, five Gs a show date
Or do you wanna see about seven digits
Fuck hoes exquisite

Artist: Young MC
Album:  Return Of The One Hit Wonder
Song:   Madame Buttafly

Chorus:

Madame, madame, madame buttafly
I just cannot, cannot, cannot tell you why
You're so pleasing, pleasing, pleasing to my eye
Cause you're butter, butter, butter and you're fly

Now the first time ever I saw you face
It was love at first sight in a public place
See you moved through the room with such style and grace
And like a sweet peice of candy yes I wanted a taste
Sex appeal in blue it was real and true
Like Chaka Kahn said girl I feel for you
But what I had to do was just chill take my time
Cause my main objective was to make you mine
Divine and every synonym that's related
It's taken many years but I'm glad that we waited
Debated on weither I should make the push
Because this bird in a hen is worth ten in the bush
Oh yes intellectual heterosexual
Have you coming back for more baby I bet you will
See what I mean when you look in my eyes
An I can tell you from the heart you're my madame buttafly

Chorus

Now madame let me tell you one thing for sure
When I first came across you I was immature
Didn't see all the changes live would put me through
And I know you can realte cause you were young then too
I had a chance to flip but no I did not trip
Stumbiling through meaningless relationships
Baby I give you a tip and you should follow the trend
Sometimes your best lovers comes from your best friends
Do you remember those late night's on the phone
Ain't nobody in the room but we're never alone
And I tell you some lady tried to tear me apart
The same time some punk tried to break your heart
And at that point it never really crossed my mind
That I wanted to be with you til the end of time
See I grew to love you that's precisly why
I can tell you from the heart you're my madame buttafly

Chorus

Now many days have passed sort of crazy fast
And I think that I have come out of my haze at last
Put myself to task and underwent the test
To see if this was real or if I was just obsessed
But it's not obsession I've learned my lesson
And grew with you through a true progression
And sting wrote a song that occured to me
That if you love somebody you should set them free
See you've been important to me in my life
And in the fairytale ending you would be my wife
But sometimes fairytales don't come true
And this won't if you don't feel the same way too
Cause all the things you've done for me I can't measure
The days and nights memories that we treasure
The time we spend as friends brings me pleasure
So it makes no sense to get tense and bring pressure
So if you want a friend than it's fine with me
And baby if you want a lover you know where I'll be
But if I find another woman than I tell her why
I became a better man knowing madame buttafly

[Hook]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Verse 1]
I was raised, the little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit, ‘cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass, Mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?
Broke out, left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Found a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips
Makin' G's was my mission
Movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella?
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
Goddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot
Black people on a rage, police, so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
‘Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right, but it's long overdue
We can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Hook]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Verse 2]
Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth?
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, Latasha, and many more
It's been going on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, ""When will the violence cease?""
When your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street
Niggas had enough time to make a difference
Bear witness, on our own business
Fuck the guard, ‘cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them ‘cause for years they would take from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down
And now Bush can't stop the hit
Predicted the shit in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggas
Felt good in the hood being around the niggas
Yeah, and for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Hook]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
(yeah), I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Verse 3]
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to have a black President
Huh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The Penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas
Rather I'd be dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

[Hook & (Ad-Lib)]
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
And I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
(Just think if niggas decide to retaliate)
(soldier in eye's)
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

That somebody else will scoop him up
Can't have that
Wanna be that girl that
Find herself a perfect match
Didn't wanna come off as bein' too fly
Got contact eye to eye
Then I walked over to him slowly
Said I know that you don't know me
But this might be my only shot at
A tenderoni
He told me that we can do this

[Produced by KNS]

[Peter Gunz]
New York to the heart, but got love for all
Lie and die in the fire, where I learned to ball
Uptown is the place where I lay my dome
On the streets of the Bronx where my family roam
Ho damn it, we home, Peter got a nine millimeter
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater
I never really liked to play a fool like that
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat
Splat, like deja vu
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew
I sip Cristal, Dom P, Mo' with pist-al
Just cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should misdoubt
Keep em near da fifties and, hundreds all arranged
Anything less than that, you keep the change
Not filthy rich, but bitch I'm barely broke
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope
Friends call me Gunz, sons call me trife
Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her
I guarantee Peter, knows how to eat her
And beat her, niggas in the Bronx call me Lex
Cause I push a Lex, and I rock a Rolex
And I lounge on Lex, and I love sex
And I wave techs on sets that be tryin to flex
Like Dex, nigga God rest your soul
But when you're playin cards for Gunz, it ain't no time to fold

[Pre-Hook: Peter Gunz]
New York niggas got crazy game
But outta town niggas is all the same
Brooklyn niggas get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot
Harlem niggas know how to play
Mack the 600, getting crazy pay
Niggas outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the Glock, running up in your spot

[Hook: Lord Tariq (Peter Gunz)]
But if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from
(Uptown baby, uptown baby
We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)
Now if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from
(Uptown baby, uptown baby
We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)

[Lord Tariq]
Yo the RM-80, is parked in the lot
Right next to the Mercedes, keep the heat cocked
For these blocks that are shady, you're crazy if you walk around
Thinking shit's gravy; stop me? Maybe
I'm livin life lawless, makin big investments
On them 8-class flawless, and hoes call us
I'm comfortable like Recaro, two quarters of my life
Walkin roads type narrow, deep thoughts which I abide by
Puffin high, got my mind's eye, points sharper
Than an arrow gettin high, keep your eye on the sparrow
Riches like the pharaoh, bought a new five
With the snitches for these hoes, trunk full of ammo
Keep my toast closer than most niggas keep they own shadow
And I strap for my foes like a saddle
I rock stones, other niggas rock gravel
Talk shit? Whatever have you, I'm from Soundview
Bronx most wanted, front get confronted
Playa, we rollin deep in the one point five hundreds
Like Big I., red eyed, mad blunted
You step outside and get blooded have your whole block flooded
With the Bronx it's a warnin, stormin guns out
From dusk 'til dawn and it's on, no doubt
Keep a eye on yo' bitch when I'm roamin about
And put a eye on yo' lip nigga, watch yo' mouth
I'm from the Bronx, wipe yo' feet when you step in my house
Cause you's a small-time nigga, bout a half an ounce now

[Pre-Hook: Peter Gunz]
New York niggas got crazy game
But outta town niggas is all the same

Verse One: Rampage

I went into the Mirage, parties on charge
10 bottles of Dom P, I'm feelin' so large
Chickens shakin' they asses like ya don't care
Guess what (what?)
This is the party of the year, flooded out Cartier
Tell 'em stop and stare
Rocks in my ear
Weighing two point eight, so I'm livin' life straight
Fuck all you player haters, I got them Now-And-Later gators
The mad future flavors
Niggas pass 'em like a pack of Life Savors
My whole cup is lime green, Flipmode is on the scene
Call me the black Charlie Sheen
The rap Itty Ammine
That makes you wanna scream, throw ya hands in the air
If you know what I mean, I countin' one (one!)
Like a basketball team
Makin' sure that you shake your ass
Till you fall out on the ground, you better bring you oxygen tank

Verse Two: Rampage

Gramp I'm a Big Willie, from New York to Philly
I Take You To The Streets like Billy
Shady niggas actin' silly
They watch my back, I still got my shit millie
I'm a cool cat, that says to myself
No fakin' jacks
My accountant pays my tax when I shop at Sax
Just bought a gold Acs, that's fully loaded
Now I'm bloated, you know my name in this rap game
I'm doing many things I can't explain
Buying it in twenty's
Back with a hundred tellin' them to keep the change
Take a long trip to Spain, I got a phat house in the ill (hill)
Sippin' Marguritas like Shaquielle
Bout to see three mill'
And build and empire, yo, yo, yo the Ramp is on fire
I won't stop rocking until I retire, Flipmode toughest squad
And we still on fire, we getz down

Chorus (sung by 702)

I wanna dedicate this song, Gone 'Til November...
To all you ladies out there, crying all alone in your room
And all you fellas, going down south...Not making it back...
May the lord bless your soul, I love you girl

(Wyclef - Chorus)
Every time I make a run
Girl you turn around and cry
I ask myself, why oh why?
See you must understand
I can't work a nine to five
So I'll be Gone...'Til November

Said I'll be Gone 'Til November
I'll be Gone 'Til November
Yo, tell my girl yo I'll be Gone 'Til November
I'll be Gone 'Til November
I'll be Gone 'Til November
Yo, tell my girl yo I'll be Gone 'Til November
January, February, March, April, May...
I see you crying, but girl I can't stay
I'll be Gone 'Til November
I'll be Gone 'Til November...
And give a kiss to my mother...

(Wyclef - Verse One)
Girl I gotta leave, please don't cry
When I come back, you know the limit's the sky
I'll take you out to dinner, to your favorite spot
Feed you an aphrodisiac just to get you hot
Drive-by movies, by a cemetary
If my corpse could talk then I would tell you I was sorry
Lifestyles of The Rich & Famous
Some die with a name, some die nameless

(Chorus 1x)

(Wyclef - Verse Two)
We had nothin'
I had to do something
So I'm Knocking On Heaven's Door, like I'm Bob Dylan
Ever comtemplating, the charges I'm facing
My new-born son, I hope I see his graduation
Take him to the movies, by the cemetary
If my corpse could talk then I would tell him, I was sorry
Lifestyles of The Rich & Famous
Some die with a name, some die nameless!

If you really dig me, and you think I'm jiggy
Come on shorty let me know
We can get together, we can do whatever
But you can't get no dough

[Verse 1: Sheek Louch]
Yo, since the Mona video you been trackin' me down
Tryin' to figure out how I lookin'perso-nal, Baby
Forget looks tell me can you roll with crooks
The three hot niggas rising in the Billboard books, nigga
We look at things through the big lens, big picture
Big Benz we try and make CEO ends
The thick chicks love us, big dick style niggas
Cristal niggas, ya'll finesse this quick style niggas
You didn't love me when my name was Sean
Now you should see how bitches act when the Benjamins come on
But I ain't hatin' em, you gotta love the ways females play
Quickly use a neglige to getta get-away
Five stars where the willies stay, and Sheek pay for nothing
But thats what ya'll herbs get for frontin'
I spend wild chips gettin' drunk up in the China
Club, while you up in Skate Key wit a minor

[Verse 2: Styles P]
I know she wit it, I betta brick I could hit it
Black tie affair I gotta fresh pair of British
Ice Berg shirts with Ice along with it
Turquoise, 9-11 Porsche and it's tinted
But honey got alot of jazz, You gotta philly
You gotta bag, then she went inside the Prada bag
Blew two and she said it was choice, like my voice
My thug style made her cat moist
That's the realest shit I heard, that's my word
Regardless who she fucked, I'm the nigga she deserves
I put her on to holdin' birds, rockin' furs
Different ways to speak without using words
And even though she proper I still gotta drop her
Cuz Sheek dont like her, had a dream that he shot her
I can't buy you ascotta, you get nada
I'm the bounce with a chick that look a little bit hotter

[Hook]
If you really dig me, and you think I'm jiggy
Come on shorty let me know
We can get together, we can do whatever
But you can't get no dough

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
They was never mine for me to dump em
Its just like checkers, after they make a move then I jump em
It's like this girlfriend I'ma keep it real
Every nigga with a deal ain't able to peel
I'm a Bad Boy so I'm caked up with whips
And guess what, I got more nuts than chips
And they gon' melt right in your mouth, not in your hand
You know that you ain't my girl, I'm not your man
But do you still wanna lick me?
Or is cause I'm a six figgy niggy, and I know Biggie
And I dont mess with no fat ladies
But if you pay like you weigh then you can stay, baby
PJ slide to tha mo like that
With this honey named trout cuz she blow like that
And when we finish don't look at me like I owe nothin'
Cuz if you really dig then let me know something

[Hook]
If you really dig me, and you think I'm jiggy
Come on shorty let me know
We can get together, we can do whatever
But you can't get no dough

[Verse 4: Styles & Sheek]
[Styles]
It's a drunk laid out in the V.I.P., can't talk about a 3 on 3
Heard a freak ask Sheek ""Big Luch why don't you pee on me?""
And her friend is tellin' Jay ""I hold a key on me.""
And I'm laughin' to myself, I got a key on me
And they friend in my ear like Lean On Me
Told her to get some bare backs and cream on me...

[Sheek]
Yeak Sheek holler to these mommies ""Ven aqui...""
Gas 'em up easily and take 'em home with me
Who respect this, can't keep her hands off my necklace
If it's good, next week I'll put her on the guest list...

[Jadakiss]
This goes out to all ya'll
There's too many names to call but ya'll know who ya'll are
See me at the bar all eyes on the R...
O-L to the E-X, sip the Henny and VS
112 sex styles baby, maybe we can fall in the L.O.X. files
You betta believe we all scorin', yeah
We can dance all night and do whatever all mornin'...ha ha...yeah...

[Hook]
If you really dig me, and you think I'm jiggy
Come on shorty let me know
We can get together, we can do whatever
But you can't get no dough

If you really dig me, and you think I'm jiggy

I'm on a mission. Look, be
They gonna find your ass missing
Ever since me and Fame came, we maintained
A strange, but a strong game
(That can't change!)
The real ghetto bad shit for blastin, subtractin
Those that ain't matchin my fashion I'm mashin
(Retality's real) Fatality's ill
When your stash in my path then your stash is a raw deal
(Clap, clap) Get your gat
(Buckabuckabubububububububuckabucka) blow, blow, get the fuck back

Chorus

Verse Three:

Lil' Fame: FACE MINE Cause I'm here
Dog its' all clear
Rap jewels put it on my baseline from a snare
Then the wanna doubt The Kid
Who analyze this whole fucking shit?
Trying to make somethin out of it
Explode quicker than landmines
M.O.P. tapes make earthquakes and cause landslides
Bump this in your Lex coupe
Or your Lex hoop
Danze, finish em, twenty-one gun salute
(The Crew)

Billy Danze: How many niggas runnin with me? *pause* (this few)
A hundred niggas gunnin with me *pause* (to shoot)
Firing Squad, draw blood on the enemy
At point-blank range, deliverin the penalty
AIN'T NOTHING BUT THE THUGS
Slangin out hollow slugs
(Nigga), anti-love keepin it real (Thug, let em slide today)
I'm known best for leavin em stretchin like Doc Holliday
Salute! *main beat stops, baseline continues*
*beat comes back in*

[Verse 1]
On your mark ready set let's go, dance floor pro
I know you know I go psycho
When my new joint hit, just can't sit
Got to get jiggy with it, ooh, that's it
Now honey honey come ride, DKNY
All up in my eye, you got a Prada
Bag with a lot of stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody looking at me
Glancing the kid, wishing they was dancing a jig
Here with this handsome kid, ciga-cigar
Right from Cuba-Cuba, I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it
Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay
Give it up jiggy make it feel like foreplay
Yo my cardio is infinite, ha-ha
Big Willie style's all in it, getting jiggy with it

[Hook]
Getting jiggy with it

[Verse 2]
What you want to ball with the kid?
Watch your step you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama mama mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off a go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all
Ya don't stop in the winter or the (Summertime)
I makes it hot, getting jiggy with 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from south street to one two fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
Cream to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?
Don't be silly, getting jiggy with it

[Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Let's start another riot cuz you can't hide
Throw your hoods in the sky if you wanna be down with mine
Pimp gangstas from the south gold grill in my mouth
Tatted out hustler Skinny Pimp talking about
Fake tricks in the game acting lame laying 'em down
To the ground insane when we clown I ain't changed
Still buck too buck North Memphis area
Where I'm from you heard of us haters getting scarier
My cousin Quan in the penitentiary and my Uncle Joe
And I'm in for the ballers and mobsters on the dance floe
You wonder how I'm blowing up I take care of my biz
And I be tearing up the club to make my bank account thick
We starting a riot be aware of the game to hang around pimps that bang we
Watching your set
Now don't throw it up and if you ain't with it quick it or you gon get wet
Now make your money and don't sneak and try to diss me
We finna start another riot live in your city, fool..

[Chorus - 4X]
Let's start another riot in this junt
If you crunk I know you with it I know you with it

[Whip]
Aggravated mind stated but under gunning
Dropping serious (edit) to have they call me the Tin Turner
Pass the blunt of the gan weed I need to hit it
Whip and Skinny Pimp collabos dropping this real (edit)
From Detroit to Memphis and Dre click up
This track so I can Skinny Pimp this and represent this
Midwest state is getting creative check the mitten
No bull(edit) causing a riot when I be spitting
Keep them amped up dropping bomb rhymes load and blow cans up
Keep your hands up I'm ripping this mic you know the man's up

Microphone assassin blasting emcees I'm dea......
(Talking)

[Chorus - 4X]

[Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
I'm coming up in this game see I was a long way from home
I'm packing my nuts tryna make it knowing though I have to fire that chrome
I'm drinking that Mo and mixed with Zay hanging in Houston kicking with fakes
Dirty South hold me straight and we never act fake
Jumping on that thug and I showing no mercy I'm breaking laws like Three 6
Gimisum Army got my back with the infrared on them gats
Beware black KKK don't stumble or fall
We cracking jaws when we rumble throwing your head thru the wall
Guests walking backwards in the crowd screaming ""Yall ain't no killas!""
Thugging and swinging at your mug like on Jerry Springer
All races yall invited stomp stomp on the floe
Even white people hype like a Van Helen show
Multi-platinum producer L.A.J. got 'em crunk
Ruthless beats be for the streets and knock a hole in your trunk
I'm coming up wilder than ever before look at the Billboard Stars we running my money
Got love in the game got stronger the whole crowd buck jumping, til the New Beginning..

You ever buck a gal weh deep like a bucket?

Draw fi your pick axe, and like a ground, you all a dig it

I don't think den right now, just to lose my main squeeze
Oh Guantanamera, you a killer!

[Intro: Mike Tyson]
Yo, Canibus, man, what's up, man?
I caught you on that cut with Wyclef
Man, you were booming
But I caught these foul slouch-ass niggas, you know I mean?
Talking foul about you the other night
On the corner of the boulevard, man, I wasn't with that
But I ain't know you well enough to defend you though, right?
But you seem like you got true game
But peep game, man, they've been playing me all my life, man
You know I won the title a couple of times
Dig right, you know what I mean?
But they can't hurt us, man, we gonna do it
Get up in this ring, man, put on these gloves
Let me show how to handle yourself, man
You don't got nobody out there with you
I gots to show you, man, get up in there, move that head, man
Come on to me, man, but when you come, man
You gotta come for blood, man
Come up to me, man, come on, bust that nigga whole
Man, niggas talking that shit about you
Hey, Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo, Canibus your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat, eat, eat, eat MC's for lunch, breakfast
Hey, man, they been playing me all my life, man
You know I won the title a couple of times, dig right?
No, but they can't hurt us, man
We gonna do it, get up in this ring man, put on these gloves
Let me show you how to handle yourself, man

[Verse 1: Canibus]
So I'ma let the world know the truth, you don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, something that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum, you only dropping clues
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes about how you used to sniff coke
Fronting like a drug-free role model, you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showing off your body ‘cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me ‘cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While 99% of your fans wear high heels
From Ice-T to Kool Moe Dee to Jay Z
Now you want to fuck with me? You must be crazy
You dripping with wack juice, and you can't get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start, nigga

[Interlude: Mike Tyson]
Yo Canibus, man, you gotta hit harder than that man
You don't want no bitch-ass niggas hanging out with me, man
We're warriors man, when we go into battle
We come out or don't come out at all

[Verse 2: Canibus]
You better give me the respect that I deserve or I'ma take it by force
Blast you with a .45 Colt, make you somersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk?
It's about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first
That's why I laugh when I hear that wack ass verse
That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life
‘Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th
God bless his soul, rest in peace, kid
It's because of him now at least I know what beef is
It's not what I would call this, see this is something different
A faggot nigga tryna make a livin' off of dissin'
Somebody that he gotta know is better than him
But he feeling himself ‘cause he got more cheddar than him
Well, let me tell you something, you might got more cash then me
But you ain't got the skills to eat a nigga's ass like me
And if you really want to show off, we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll let you kick a verse, fuck it, I'll let you kick 'em all
I'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom, your 1st, 2nd and 3rd-born
Make your wife get on the horn, call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it
I say ""Naw, he started it, he forgot what a hardcore artist is""
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man
Such as myself, trained to run 20 miles in soft sand
On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars offhand
From a lost and forgotten land
You done did it, man, you done spitted some wack shit
And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'll forget it? Fuck that!
‘Cause like Common and Cube, I see the bitch in you
And I'ma make the world see it too, motherfucker

[Interlude: Referee]
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new lyrical weight champion
By second round knock out
3 minutes and 40 seconds, Can-i-bus

[Outro: Mike Tyson]
Yo, Canibus man, you moving like Mike Tyson Jr
Man, you in-and-out, and you're agile with your flow, man
But dig right, you got to eat, man
That's your name Canibus
Your whole agenda is to eat these niggas, man
They have no business to be in the same stage with you
Holding the mic with you, but dig right
Hey, Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo, Canibus, your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat, eat, eat, eat MC's
For lunch, breakfast, dinner; that's your agenda, baby
Your agenda to consume them
Their whole existence, they can't exist in your presence
The Canibus is here to rule forever, Mike Tyson, on the def

You can never compare to rhymes I write

Niggas try to take my reign I'm shittin' on 'em
As is I'm trippin' on 'em tracks I'm flippin' on 'em
Niggas ain't satisfied 'til my weapon is spittin' on 'em
Everytime I bust mine your soul burn
You niggas yearn to learn my flows spread the germs
Makin' you squirm any MC can get his ass beat
Blowin' up the spot in spite of the last beef
Chiki ko ya highest title ya numero uno
My wife is Puerto Rican so we speak in ??

Verse 2
Who the most John Blaze?
And who John Doe?

Heeyyy stick it up in yo' girl so I'm quick
Tickle it hee hee hee hee hee Who I be?

Came through the crowd, heard the brother booin
Said real low, 'Hey whatcha doin?'
Don't you know I've been rappin on tracks

Rapped out a hit on the plane out to Spain
My mind go in space when I'm kissin on jane
Can't Stand the Rain, but, love Missy
I rock with mad funk so my middle finger pissy
Look for me I'm Chico undercover at the Nico
Mag and double-ooh got gas from burrito
Lay you like Frito if you're white then amigo
In my plaid tuxedo, the rap Al Pacino
Star in Casino, to a veterino
Not Italia-no, but still gambino
Most of y'all rappers can't do your part
I'mma finish up what you all can't start
Got no heart I thought on your LP
I'm on your radio and on your TV

When I get money you know I like to keep it
How I get money niggas you try to peep it
Flipmode be niggas you wanna form a team with
Them get money niggas the ones to plot the scheme with
Them niggas that be used to getting money frequent
The ones that would always measure my triple beam with
Until they start taking my niggas to the precinct
That's all back in the day yo that ain't nothing recent
Cause now-a-days it be bitches we like to speak with
Eat with
Lay them down and sleep with
Type of pussy make a nigga wanna keep it
Shorty be so exotic she looking decent
Lot of corny niggas be offering wack free shit
I can't hold the heat no more yo I gotta release it

What ya'll wanna do

Now, everytime that I meet a nigga who fronting
It's alright cause you getting money and everybody want it
Smoke a big spliff
Get myself for a blunted
Fall on the floor and I gotta call my S500
Iceburg 5 where you at
No need for alarm
Right now I'm cruising to the sounds of my enhancing song
Hurry up 5
Ayyo you know it's about to get thick
I see this cat a way behind my back about to do a stick
Tell me where you at
I will be there in 10 seconds flat
You know I got your back
I'll be there just in time to counteract
Sometimes I'm unforget cooth
My S5 bulletproof
I turbo boost
And blast right through your motherfucking roof
Coming through
Hitting you
Knocking out a nigga's tooth
Full speed ahead like we running a toll booth
Produce more flavor than Very Fine juice
Call a truce
Before me and my niggas'll let loose

All my ladies in the place to be
Getting money while they next to me
Let me see
Let me hear you say fire it up (fire it up)
Say fire it up (fire it up)
All my people just wave your hand
Getting money all across the land
One time
Let me hear you say fire it up (fire it up)
Say fire it up (fire it up)
C'MON!

Bleach the heat
You're letting loose to the extreme
Me and the Iceburg S5 bounce from the scene
Recline my seat rock to the beat
Leaning so hard, it's like my whole squad up in the Jeep
Blowing up the spot or we hit them know what I mean
Got you open we keeping you niggas up like caffine
Flying ghetto team
Seeing everything on my little computer screen
From here to Phillipine
Keep it moving we never run out of gasoline
Gas me you ossen a nigga with kerosine
Me and my 5 be running some mission you've never seen
Hot shit making you niggas forever feen
Anyone of you coming, you better come clean
Hit you with an overdose of more rhyme and Phetamine
Got your eye blood shot you need Physine

[Intro]
Make a long live the Villain nigga, fuck a intro

[Hook]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[Verse 1]
Nigga ten years passed, and we still up in that ass
Villain make it all continuing, look at all the shit you in
Eazy-Duz-It, happy like the shit we used to do
5 niggas coming out the C-P-T, so fuck you
Time changed for the good
Niggas in the hood be coming up
Villain can you set it off again, you know, you should
Yo let's take this shit back to 1989
Where these niggas shit, I'm busting, niggas know they couldn't find
Dream Team lovers, Egyptian fan based
Villain hit the scene, all them fools got erased
Threw a motherfucking monkey, wrench up in the rap game
Since I hooked up with E, shit ain't never been the same
Opened up doors for you niggas that be thinking
That your flows be on tizight
Biting what I wrizite, joking when I recite
Villain manuscripts when I MC
If it ain't ruff it ain't me

[Hook]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[Verse 2]
All y'all motherfucking G's nigga, like Eric Wright
You can floss for your bitch, but you know this shit is tight
Cause when y'all niggas started rappin, who you trying to be?
I'mma slap you cause you lying if you don't be saying me
Or the other 3, that the FBI be phone tapping
Shoot the government before you niggas start rapping
Now it's clone city, I gotta bomb it like Iraq
Use my alias, spend my nights at The Shack
Ruthless attack all the way to two thou'
Try to black it out, but you never knew how and when
I walk through the crowd, I'm seeing motherfucker's brain
I hear their bitches saying that's MC Ren
Making fools Sway when I pull the King Tech's
Because I started cussing all you fools getting checks
Ruthless for life, see, that be my state of mind
Y'all can Kizz My Black Azz one more time

[Hook]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[Verse 3]
I run a hundred miles just so I can MC
Villain wants that bomb so I get with L.T
Ain't nothing changed, we find them, fuck them, then flee
While you're hating, pillow talking, with that bitch, she want me
Niggas weed crazy, Dre and Snoop turned you out
Now y'all cristal sipping, y'all niggas be tripping
Make the West look like ass, all full of shit
Investing drug money, shit still didn't hit
What it takes for y'all quit, Ruthless got it on lock
Y'all shooting videos trying to look like 'Pac
Here we come, here we come, blowing up your spot
With my little brother Jubee and that Bigg homie Rocc
Full Circle, all that shit gone repeat
When the shit dropped, niggas clowning in the streets
The saga continues right before your eyes
Villain gives a fuck nigga, cause this is ruthless for life

[Hook]
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life
The saga continues right before your eyes
The saga continues cause it's do or die
The saga continues right before your eyes
You know why? Why? - Cause I'm Ruthless for life

[Verse 1-Doonie Baby]

Go ahead take a center, Satan's coming for dinner
In this world of living hell you can never be a winner
Now crooks with bad looks and tricks that got shook
You play with Doonie Baby and your life just got took
I'm living in the lines of money and fast cars
I'm used too being poor drinking wine from jelly jars
The storm
Loved by thugs and hookers alike
Faggots and dykes sweated by reverend knight
Nikies and Reeboks
More wet than droptops
Years for lifeline for nigga's who wanna shine
Alizé and Buddha
Bloods with six shooters
Hoes with fat clits and bitches with big hooters
With money movers freakin' with hella hoes
In the back of land cruisers
Niggas don't give a damn
Macaroni and candy yams curse the government
I got a bullet for Uncle Sam

[Hook]

Lord won't you please help me
Jesus
Take a sinner out me
Jesus
But if you feel you can't help me
Jesus
Just let my mind be free
Jesus

[Verse 2]

Now enemies envy just crawling like centipedes
Nuclear bombs which just made heaven bleed
Now if its all a game, why is the government shamed?
On computer based files now they know my name
Cos' ive been living in the ghetto of mind states that penetrate
Bodily functions
That have high class luncheons
I'm living in the lines of drugs and many lies
Used to being high so I won't have to cry
Super fly, loved by hookers and drug addicts
Fiends and dope heads getting sweated by city feds
Creepers and crawlers t
He biggest are baller's
Nicotine my ease pull, when those thugs annoy
Peace and gin, hella ho's with MAC-10's
Kids with switchblades and mamma's with hella sin
Killing for stupid trends
Making money stacking ends
And even money makers get jacked by family friends
This world is at the end
No hope for Resurrection
I'm sitting up in church with an UZI for protection


[Hook]

Lord won't you please help me
Jesus
Take a sinner out me
Jesus
But if you feel you can't help me
Jesus
Just let my mind be free
Jesus

Mega large collossal nigga you docile
And I sizable play me close and I'll ox you
That's only logical cause I'm fact, you costume
Now who da obstacle?
Throw basic, watch me blaze shit, The All's faced it
It's natural for champs to hate shit
Plenty cases, some anonymous, age m-i-n-t
With a diamond glist, like jewelery
You hold on, you'll see, if it kill me
All City, bound to be rich, without the filthy
My players skillt me, your glares don't tilt me
My pops def' built to the point
I'm not moved by no thing
Man or material, crime without the serial
Never been inside, unless it was a V.I
Although they got plans to knock me
I feel 'em watchin' me, eyein' the city while we monopoly
The game is hot to me, but I play to win ""CREW""

""No...no doubt baby... All City CREW...don't get it wrong...

Verse 2:

Yo, yo, yo
We the forever livin', there's no beginnin' or endin'
All City's The Actual, y'all niggas is pretendin'
In jeans and linen, I will attract the flyest women
My waves stay spinnin', and not a dime of mine they spendin'
That's pimpin' tradition, play Sony in the Expedition
Play your position, who wandered with my coalition
We boa constricted, gettin' so many splits it's sickenin'
Lyrically stick ya, every pedestrians a victim
I gotta addiction, to marijuana and the Henny
Brooklyn send me, we break bread and convert pennies into major dollars
We lock jaws like rottweilers, duck tapin' your mouth
So they can't here you hollar, you held for hostage
Now we informed ya niggas, the ransom is handsome
Seven digit figures, and some, while back at the mansion
We light up the Branson, and write hot shit to leave you dancin'
As we advance on through, All City ""CREW""

""Ready to flip shit, comin' through with crew...

Verse 3:

For this dough yo, the mega flowin' coastal
Plan to be the next mogul, through rap vocal
No love if I don't know you, fam is so few
N-Y streets I flow through, layin low dope, like I'm suppost to
Till I'm boku, in the gold coupe, the city wanna whole Lou
You couldn't go through, platinum medallion with the opal
Swingin' low true, you fugazi, yo shit's shaky, made you shady
The mega psalms hades, never play thee
Put in work till shit's gravy, move greatly, up in the grey V-12
Puffin the hazy, eyes lazy, thoughts paisley
Me and my shorty from Baisley, All City raise due
New ones to follow, chrome nozzle, we spit things that leave you hollow
Sophisticato, strictly for the cargo, gems sparkle, new wave
El DeMarco, I play my part though, the city hot though ""CREW""

""don't get it wrong...comin' through with the crew...""

Verse 4:

Yo, I'm certified raw, you heard of me before
Verbally I'm bringin war to those who wanna murder me
Put ya niggas servin' me, King put 'em through surgery
Had you on a respirator in state of emergency
Rob you for your currency, y'all worry me not
Blast a shot and watch you faggot niggas scurry from spot
I play the devils advocate play me sideways I ain't havin' it
You rather get mauled by attack dogs, thats havin' this
You can't fathom this, when in the presence of the fabulous
Rap attackin' this, fly at niggas with the rapidness
Who 'bout to clap at this, we at the top of our rank
Your shit is juvenile compared to my style you shootin' blanks
Behold this metropolis, gold, throw ya hands in
Me and my mans'n, we explodin' like loose cannons
Lace you quick with the basic wit, Tiger like Asics
Theatrical niggas be tryin' to play sick, stay awake kid...

[Intro]
And so it was written, and after all these things
I saw another angel come down from heaven
Having great power, and the earth was lightened with his glory
And he cried mightily with a strong voice saying
""Babylon the great has fallen
Has fallen and has become the habitation of devils
And the home to every foul spirit
And a cage of very unclean, and hateful men""

[Verse 1]
What you see is what you get now
Xzibit never wait around for no kickdown, got my own shit loud
Shot heard around the world
Uplift, bench press, arm curl, keep the structure of the temple
To make things simple, my existence is a ripple through time
Only concerned with what is mine, divine
Never monkeyshine, walkin down a very thin line
Holdin heat, runnin crazy in the streets, yeah (What's up?)
Plus the company I keep put in overtime while you oversleep
Don't wanna see none of this evil I speak
Around the atlas, cume la matra, the super actress
You all get close-lined and pinned to the mattress
All day, every day, every which way
Who said you can't have your cake and eat it too (Fuck you!)
This is hard time on Planet Earth, for what it's worth
Xzibit stay in rotation without rehabilitation like this

[Bridge]
Players, pimps, hoes, hustlers
Willies, thugs, ballers, busters
Gangstas, macks, everyday, all day
Shot callers, even high rollers keep it moving

[Hook]
What you see is what you get now
The kinda style make the whole world go wild
Bless the child that can hold his own, flesh and bone
And no matter where I roam I feel right at home, and that's the real shit

[Verse 2]
You got more than you bargained for; hit the floor
I pull a fast one to let you know today could be your last one black
Take your breath like an asthma attack
Just a slave like Flavor Flav, ""You're blind to the facts""
Mr. X to the Z, tha Liks and King Tee
Guaranteed to bring the house down naturally
Niggas knowin No Limits like Master P
Makin you motherfuckin bastards see (What?)
A whole different breed of MC; realize it's you against me
Catch a three-hundred and sixty degree
Roundhouse to the mouth right
And like the sun, make the hot shit shine bright
I feelin like my whole life is a green light never turn red
Cause I strike like a rattlesnake, lock like a dread
Niggas wanna bump heads, but they better off dead
Came crashin through the door like the Feds, bring it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The year everybody start to rush
Swingin through is your friendly neighborhood lush
I crack your bottle then watch how Xzibit bust
I regulate like a killer with a nickel plate, I set it straight
Start to shakin you down, breakin new ground, construction work
Heavy artillery, put your dick in the dirt
Stay alert, the game is rough so you might get hurt
Slug burnt through your jacket through your sweater, through your shirt
Get cut from the belly up (What?)
I break the chain, fast lane, suck my sugar cane
I'm tryin to spark a nigga brain while you entertain trivial things
Material things, protected by the underground kings
Who rule the land with an iron fist
The Men in Black, if we flash can't remember shit (Sorry)
You cross me, I'll make you pay like the government, I wanna kill Sam
Cause my package came short twelve grams, get the picture?

[Hook]
Now you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way

[Q-Tip]
Messing me up, my whole head
Teasing me, just like Tisha did Martin
Now look at what you're starting
Schoolboy's crush and it ain't on the hush
The whole world sees it but you can't (uh)
My peoples they complain, sit and rave and rant (come on)
Your name is out my mouth like an ancient chant (say what?)
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant...

[Phife]
Speaking of which, got a leash and I wish just to rock you miss (come on)
Make a militant move, peep my strategy (what?)
End of the day you're not mad at me (uh)
Not dealing with nobody, now that's what you told me (what?)
I said: ""hey yo, it's cool, we can just be friendly"" (come on)
Cause yo, picture me messing it up
Her mind now corrupt with the ill C-Cups
Shit, I'm on my J.O. (come on)
Bullshitting, hoping that the day goes slow (what?)
Got me like a friend, what confuses me though
Is kisses when we breeze, tell me what's the deal yo? (deal yo, yo, yo...)

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Q-Tip]
Now why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Making things for me towards you harder
Killing me, just when I think we're there
You douse the whole vibe and the flows in the air
Telling me 'bout next man
But next man ain't the nigga with the plan
Who got your heart in mind?
It's about time that you just unwind (come on)

[Phife]
And let it just happen, make it front-free (uh)
Just sweat me like Moneypenny (uh)
Digging you, getting inside of your stee (what?)
It's the Quest cat keeping you company
Forever, or however you want it

[Q-Tip]
Word word, now wait a minute Ma before you jet into the curb (yeah, yeah)
Start to make affections, which is good not the herb
But it, it ain't me, and I, I ain't blurred (uh)
I'mma still just chill with you
Maybe things could change if you change your view (come on)
If not then I guess it is cool (yeah)
Just, to keep to yourself and abide by the rules, right

Check it out now...
Check it out now...
Like that now...
Check it out now...
Wha wha now...
Check it out now...
Yeah yeah now...
Check it out now...
Check it out now...
It's like that now...
Check it out now...
Yeah yeah now...

What you say, what? what?

And just can't find some anywhere?

From seed to clone, and the best homegrown
And if you're afraid of those pesky pork choppers in the sky

To block the nosy pig's vision

Hyuh, hyuh, hello mah name is Jaid
And ahm a farmer and I've been growin

At them pesky porkers no more

""Hello Dr. Greenthumb, paging Dr. Greenthumb!""

[B-Real]
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
In the hills where the trees grow wild with weed fields
The fucking pigs with shields holding the blue steels
Greenhouse effect with the weed connect
(Doctor) DEA can't keep Greenthumb in check (Doctor!)
HPS, God Bless the whole crop
Please God, don't let me see no cops
Trunkload, ready to hit the highway
Don't let the eye in the sky fly my way
Or we gonna have big trouble, that's no shit
Can't be growin without no permit
But fuck that, I study the 215 trip
That way when they come they can suck my dick
Weed can't grow without attention
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Chorus:

[B-Real] Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
[SenDog] Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
[B-Real] I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
[SenDog] Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
[B-Real] Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
[SenDog] Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
[B-Real] I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
[SenDog] Aiyyo Dr. Greenthumb, come on back one time!

[B-Real]
People can't live without the herb man
If not they'd be drinkin and drivin and swervin
But thanks to Dr. Greenthumb weed grow
In the backyard or inside with hydro
To the kush plant brush in a tangerine dream
Tasty, blowin a fuckin smokescreen
Cycles of weed are constantly grown
Somebody give me the razor to cut clones
I'd like to stop, but it feels so good
Horny plants stinkin up my whole neighborhood
DEA, never wanna leave me alone
But never ever ever gotta warrant for my home
What that funny sound knockin at the door (Open up it's the DEA!)
Sorry Greenthumb can't talk no more
Please don't follow me into the sun
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb

Chorus 1/2

[B-Real]
Out from the lab, no need for rehab
If I can't drive then call me a cab (ese!)
In my closet the weed is dried out
Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out
I don't wanna buy no weed from no cop
Get locked up and they close up my shop
That's why I buy no weed from no one
That's why they call me Dr. Greenthumb
The scientifical, mystical one
Growin my crops with the rays of the sun
Come one come all and see how it's done
If you see the pigs there's no need to run
Cause some of these pigs are down with Greenthumb
But you never know what be the outcome
You see the photo in the album
The weed is growin like my erection
Look I never told you where I was from
Some call me Real, but I'm Dr. Greenthumb

Chorus

Dr. Greenthumb
Doctor, your Bulova plant needs special tending to
Doctor, we need more oxygen we need more CO2
Doctor, Dr. Greenthumb you're needed
Doctor, dahyahahahhh... Doctor

*  promo version ""Fuck Somebody Up"" had slightly different
With ""Fuck"" instead of ""Spark""

[Intro: Buddha Monk, (computerized deep voice), [sampled singer]]
(all hip hop acknowledge, prepare to embark the known)
[Oooooohhhh) News flash: they just let my ass out the damn door
Umm.. (yea)

[Chorus: Sampled singer]
You gonna make me spark somebody up (Yo, you, you and you)
If ya keep on doin the things ya dooooo (That's right, everybody)
You gonna make me spark somebody up (I mean you and you and you)
If ya keep on doin the things you are dooooin, don't wanna do it (Don't do
It)

[Buddha Monk]
Yo, I'm tired of these niggas in this industry
Procrastinate to assassinate me, what you high off some trees?
I figure ya said that cuz yo' bitch was on yo' back
Dead that, this vigilante wit' swords gon' come and chop down yo' facts
I stand amongst he square with a youth, phony prevail
Anythin other than that nigga, just condemned by Hell
Is you slick just to do the shit like Buddhists?
Heather B, three hundred sixty degrees, level move this
My audio shells is my surface and my third eye covered by mucus
Oh, so there's a hundred-eight pressure points, I'm sorry ya didn't know
This
Ha, ya hopeless, also soon to be homeless
Ya betta sit back and start taken fuckin dough to this
My dosage, sick like white lotus, don't never quote this
Realize this tritan is mad ferocious
For the minute, I rolls out my Old Earth's home
Thug life became known and sold drugs like Al Capone
So, you'se a so-called thug nigga, here's a slug for ya wigga
How ya figure? Ya test the style that was born to be wit' ya
I was born to be bad, the Brooklyn Zu, Thief of Bagdad
Lay yo' ass on the grass, and gimme all ya fuckin cash!
Cuz..

[Chorus: Sampled singer, (Buddha Monk)]
You gonna make me spark somebody up (Yo, you, you and you)
If ya keep on doin the things ya dooooo (Don't make me do it!)
You gonna make me spark somebody up (You know who I be, nigga, what?!)
If ya keep on doin the things you are dooooin, don't wanna do it!
(Level seven)

[Buddha Monk]
Yo, to each and every men, call yo' ten best friends
And watch this verbal murder just start to begin
Ha, like winds, my style enters yo' anatomy
Reconstruct yo' mind, niggas, and shake to' bone cavity
Are you mad at me? Take yo' ass to Buddha Monk's academy
Get a crash-test course, nothin new for the G-O-D
You so silent, so silent then don't do it
For to be all bad, plus styes that run up like blood fluid
Yo, I'm true to this, wet rap flows like breakin mucus
Hit you so hard, it feels like a shift in yo' uterus
Have no clue to this? Oh, Buddha Monk's just movin in this mist
Yo, it's pure verbal murder when I get into yo' shiiiit

[Chorus: Sampled singer, (Buddha Monk)]
You gonna make me spark somebody up (hahahaha)
If ya keep on doin the things ya dooooo (Level ten)
You gonna make me spark somebody up (I mean you and you and you)
If ya keep on doin the things you are dooooin, dont wanna do it!

[Buddha Monk]
Watch these whirlwind kicks, we move forward this very day
You pray that our kills it on yo' whole family
This technique that we speak seeps inside the devil's teeth
Now you're body's been breached by the seven-dotten priest
Stop the lyin, all hail to the God that's now residin
To teach the new souls the nightmares of lost foes
I move worst than Babylon, son I'll tally up ya arm
Throw this knowledge like windstorms, crown the sovreigns that bear arms
We Manchuz, Masta Allah Rahmel now sees you
And the Zig-Zag-Zag, seven fly picture this pyramid
Can't erase this shit I gave you from the devil, the triple-six
Manchuz not duck low while Brooklyn Zu make body blows
Hide your feet on hot coals, North Star fourty-eight track impose
Lyrics assassin strike low, Buddha Monk is above the law!
Now it's war! Things ain't just peace no more
You niggas hit the floor floor, face the, face the floor, floor

[Chorus: Sampled singer, (Buddha Monk)]
Say, you gonna (you)
You gonna... (you and you and you)
You gonna, ya gonna.. (what you gonna do?)
Ya gonna make me spark somebody up (Buddha Monk, you've done it again)
If ya keep on doin the things ya dooooo
(I don't wanna, yes, I don't wanna!)
You gonna make me spark somebody up
(This is dedicated to all those who think I'm a real MC)
I don't wanna do it, yo, don't wanna do it!

[Outro: computerized high-pitched voice]
Buddha Monk, you just keep bangin em funky
You just keep bangin em funky
You know you a crazy cat, right?
Yes, that's right, baby
Huh-huh-huh-huh, yea...

Yeah that's right
We gonna flash back
To 1983
I'ma show you niggas how I was spittin' this pimp game
Before most of you niggas even started rappin'
1983
Too $hort
Word for word
Like this baby
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

A nigga like me I know what's up
I want a nasty bitch with a lot of butt
If I can't find one anywhere
It turns my dreams to nightmares
Baby right there ain't got no ass
But she's okay if she got cash

Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

I'll tell 'bout a day that I had
Seen nothin' but bitches with no ass
I woke up early feeling right
Do the same damn thing every day of my life
Cause every morning you know I get
A good blowjob from a real fine bitch
Strokin', smokin', sir Too $hort
Thinking about the day before
30 minutes after I rolled out
I pulled a freak took her to my house
She was hella young with a lot of butt
She sucked my dick and then we fucked
That good tight pussy I couldn't pass
A light-skined freak with so much ass
At 1 P.M. I was fuckin' away
I wanna do the same thing again today
Today my story made itself
Every bitch I saw was flat as hell
I told myself ""I must need glasses""
Where's them bitches with the big round asses
Me and me homie just wanna be tuff
Freak two bitches then switch'em up
It was 3:35 the strip was lit
Every two blocks I saw a different bitch
Waiting on the bus some was walking
Me and my homie just started talking
I said ""Homie she looks good""
He said ""That ass is flat as wood""
I said ""What about baby in the black""
And he said ""$hort she's all back""

Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

Every single day of the week
For every nigga living there's a freak
If you got game and a bed
Why not get fucked and get some head
Cause bitches all over wanna get fucked
I just need one with a lot of butt
Me and my homie rollin' and smokin'
Flat booty bitches took over Oakland
I told my homie ""I hate to say
All the bitches with ass stayed home today""
And he said ""$hort what now?""
Put the pedal to the metal and hit the B-town
I thought them bitches out there was fine
But the invasion was on and it fucked my mind

Bitches, Bitches, Bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

We hit the B-town like Oakland players
I knew it bitches was everywere
The first one had tities so fat
But that don't work her ass was flat
The second bitch was flat too
Talked about the bitch like a muthafuckin' fool
I said ""Beyotch
I know I'm capin'
Where's your ass baby, what happened?""
She turned around caped back on me
Said ""Fuck you nigga, where's your teeth?""
I damn near fell jumping out the car
But I slapped that bitch and slapped her hard
My homie said ""$hort, we gots to cut""
But I was spankin' that bitch on her big flat butt
We parked the car and took a walk
I saw another bitch and I had to talk
I said ""Baby, baby, baby come here
Yeah you baby with the long long hair""
Baby came over from across the street
Standing on the corner talking to me
I was spittin' the game but I talked too fast
Cause I didn't even notice that she had a flat ass
Sheit!
And I was ready to go
We was rollin' back to the O'
I told that bitch ""I changed my mind""
She looked at me and she said ""Why""
I said ""I'm Sir Too $hort the Oakland player
I'm not one of them niggas who don't care
It's no thang to do my duty
But not with you and your flat booty""
In the Berkley town what did we find
Freak after freak with no behind
One long day I never got in
I'm glad that shit never happened again

Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches

The invasion (Beyotch) is on

That's that old school
'83
Still pimpin' baby
$hort dog
You know I can't stay away from this game

How ya doin' sweetheart?
Heya, you know these last few months we've been together
Happened so right and I'm just so happy for what we shared
I've been wonderin'...how do you feel?

I wanna get lost in love with you
And do all the things you want me to
Caress your body touch your soul
Cuz boy I love you so
I wanna get lost in love with you
And do all the things you want me to
Caress your body touch your soul
Cuz boy I love you so

The love we shared something so especial
Es tan contigo is all I wanna do every night
Ever since el primer dia, the first day
I knew it'd last forever if I had it my way
So the days go on, no hago otra cosa
But dream about the moment, our hearts will come closer
Holdin' tu mano in your face tan bonita
Never met another young lady senorita
And that is why I gotta say that you're the best
A millon and one ways just to express
Mi amor I know that we will be together
So, sing to me, baby, and sing forever

I wanna be with you always
Together forever 'til our ending days
Hold me baby don't let go
Makin' love like never before
I wanna be with you always
Together forever 'til our ending days
Hold me baby don't let go
Makin' love like never before

Makin' love in the night time, walks and romance
I'm telling you, hermosa, my heart is in a trance
They say that true love is so hard to find
I thank the man up above for makin' you mine
Talkin' on the telephone, sendin' you kisses
A dozen of roses just to say that I am missin'
The warmth of your body right next to mine
Ere es tu la mejor like a toast of fine wine
Out to the movies, maybe sharing some ice cream
Si estoy dormido, don't wake me from my dream
Todo lo que quiero, all I need is your affection
My life was fine but you brought profection
Now we sit here just holdin' hands
Whispers in my ear tell me that I'll be your man
Today, manana in a paradise for two
I feel the same way 'cuz I'm so in love with you

I love the way you make me feel
My love for you is all so real
Embrace my body, touch me softly
Love me 'til the morning
I love the way you make me feel
My love for you is all so real
Embrace my body, touch me softly
Love me 'til the morning

You know that love we shared is just something so special
I just don't know what to say, girl
Would you sing to me one more time?
Do it like this, c'mon

I wanna get lost in love with you
And do all the things you want me to
Caress your body, touch your soul
Cuz boy I love you so
I wanna be with you always
Together forever 'til our ending days
Hold me baby, don't let go
Makin' love like never before

See the crowd in an uproar acting unstable
Here comes Dark Gable raps remarkable
Mic ripper, cash flipper, Cristal sipper
Derrie're batalliere that's French for ass whipper
Long time putting work in this, to be tremendous
If I'm not the best then I'm a damn striking resemblance
I roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice
And cause great disturbance just like a poltergeist
I come attacking this enrage to disengage the missing page
To the newest in age that's hitting stage
For I be one that knows the art
To get you up and out your seat, if you was Rosa Parks
Tell me how much can you take from me the man to make
Rhymes that's so butter my breath smell like land o lakes
You know the lick, seen me hit em like a brick
Plus my posse run thick, not that click from Mario flick
Beware of one of the best they be
You wanna test the God I hope you mean a SAT
Because your poetasterous style it plain bore me
Pardon the vainglory, but here's the Kane story

Chorus
Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky

Verse 2
Fuck the chorus
And let the lyrics sit up in the track like rigamortis
I spit a few to listen to when this I do it's as if as you
Was invisible it'll make your life miserable
Hip-hop icon, keep a grip like a python
I be that wrong one to get fly on
Boy you got to get that playa hatin' out you
That's the other side of the game and I ain't Erykah Badu
Black Caesar, don't you even reach my way
You'd sooner find a vital point that's on Priest Pai Mae
I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys
A fast demise disaster lies as he dies
Confront one of the best at rhyming
What I write it be so rough that my ink pen need alignment
The untouchable, don't want to tempt me
I come kicking through your door, unlawful entry
It be me, even though none of y'all want to see me
For real, damn I know how Jehovah's witness feel
I remember how I formed it up
Cause I took what was raw and then I warmed it up
Turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up
But take a look I think the Kane about to overcook
Come and get it, but you better come with paramedics
Cause you couldn't bring it to me if you worked for Fed Ex
I come cutting through split his gut in two
I touch em what em do you know the style ain't nothing new

Chorus
Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down baby we keep it live
Repeat

Verse 3
A good game it lets the plot thicken
But the thing that just ain't clickin'
Is the way y'all legalize trickin'
You talk about your ride and you don't even got one
But I can pull a hot one, when inside of a Datsun
The wicked in the bed, plus the wicked in the head
When I shoot the game, it's like my tongue got infra red
Let the Messiah take you higher as I supply ya' what you require
Desire and admire it entire
Sudden impact as I'm guttin' em black
Closest thing to me would be; nothin' in fact
I come with more in skill, to always score and kill
Females adore and thrill, sweeter thang than Lauryn Hill
As I return with a vengeance, here comes the day of independence
Approach them all with some bad intentions
In other words I'm making them resign, diminish mine
Runnin' through them like a finish line

Chorus

[Grand Puba]
Now a lot of people think this is easy as it looks
Books and books of rhyme concepts and hooks
Session to session to get thoughts manifested
Stressin and stressin to hit the world with a blessin
Lot of people often ask, ""Puba how you givin' back?""
The way I give back is through the knowledge of my raps
Like a gem, for all my people caught out on a limb
Who be givin in, caught out on a stem, who don't wanna win
""I'm feelin you I know you gettin down like that
But what I'm sayin Dog is let me hold a little somethin black!
I'll hit you back!"" C'mon dead that, that's the tenth time
I heard that—all you know is gimme I work hard for every penny
That I make—video and tape
LP and CD, if I fall, you feedin me?
No dough to spread, always keep a level head
Long as my seeds get fed, it won't go to my head, so..

""Don't let it go your head, no!""
Everybody love a star, when he on top
""Don't don't let it go your head, no!""
Nobody comes around when the star start to drop
""Don't let it go your head, no!""
Strive to help others who help themselves
""Don't let it go your head, no no no no no!""
Knowledge of self, and good health and wealth

[Sadat X]
The ladies a dame, no question but you can’t tell her that
Cuz sometimes she speed and put her hand out
Like I'm that ATM nigga, drop me off at Chase
Earing in her naval like she sex-u-al
She royalty but her whole loyalty to smoke
Get wrecked in the kitchen like she run the cooking channel
And then hide the heat in the car door
God damn she’s a mother to be, I’m hoping twins
Give me a whole tribe
And be as sexy as Janet was on the cover of Vibe
She slick talk, threaten to walk
She got a girlfriend I used to tap back when
So she always worry and bitches
I tell her hold it down ma I give you high ranks
Sometimes you wild but I guess thats your style
If you lay up in my high-rise, will you stay wise?
Will I slay thighs? Open your eyes, girl

""Don't let it go your head, no!""
Don't believe those jealous type cats
""Don't don't let it go your head, no!""
Cause I'm the one makin some late night cash
""Don't let it go your head, no!""
I told you girl my home is my castle
""Don't let it go your head, no no no no no!""
Understand it won't be no hassle

[Lord Jamar]
I heard your single on the battle of the beats
It won five nights, I bet you had the time of your life
Workin so hard, and so long, to make a record
Finally to make a song people respected
Collect the dough at a show as you sip the Mo'
Now you hittin the flo', you never hit befo'
Got you trippin, how much better could it get?
Got the leather with the work check, all up in the whip
They're all legitimate, callin it what it's really not
This is just one single you got, that's really hot
Tomorrow it could bust just like a blood clot
Leave you in the dust with your body to rot
Another party to rock, if it's you or if it's me
It doesn't matter cause it just won't stop
Don't let your gray matter pop
Cause when you release the album
If they don't cop, you gonna get dropped, so..

""Don't let it go your head, no!""
Cause one single don't make you a hit
""Don't don't let it go your head, no!""
Stay true to who you are don't never forget
""Don't let it go your head, no!""
Keep your feet on solid ground
""Don't let it go your head, no no no no no!""
Cause what goes up, must come down, uhh

""Don't let it go your head, no!""
""Don't don't let it go your head, no!""
""Don't let it go your head, no!""
""Don't let it go your head, no no no no no!""

[Fat Pat]
Welcome to the land, where it just don't stop
Trunks pop tops drop, see and the front end hop
Paint flop screens on, acting bad in the zone
Yeah it's on riding chrome, balling at my home
Texas plates don't hate, showing up in the state
Can't wait get it straight, while the front end break
Paid the cost to be the boss, looking good when I floss
Sunshine let it down, turn it up and clown
Fool around hit your block, trunk going on knock
Let it up let it pop, light up the whole block
Southside how we hold, on a gangsta stroll
Music hitting so hard, knocking off side molds
Hit the highway, cruise control, go on let it roll
Po' up the drank fire it up, make sho' the windows closed
On chrome high side, throwing up the Southside
Giving niggas dap coming down, wrecking the slab

[Hook - 2x]
Trunks keep popping
Tops keep dropping down in Houston
Trunks pop, trunks pop, trunks pop, trunks pop
Tops drop, tops drop, tops drop, tops drop

[Fat Pat]
Now what's up H-Town, cause we know that they feel us
Three wheeler four peeler, acting bad for scrilla
Swisha burna bouncing turner, sitting low on 4's
I'm pulling through the lot, slamming do's on buttons
And I'mma slide slide, slippidy slide
Pop trunk let it down, show up in my ride
Roll out the red carpet, never buy it to park it
Valet piece and chain, starch is my jeans
Hit the club showing love, tip the dancer a dub
Got killa in the club, for after the club
One more time for they mind, I'mma gon put it down
It's that boy Fat Pat, yeah I got's to clown

I just wanna drop it, all night long
Yeah, yeah, I just wanna drop it
All night long yeah, drop it, drop it, drop it

[Hook - 2x]

[Fat Pat]
And you laced on the game, that cost a fee
Bouncing on the track, with P-A-T
Now they see how it be, I'm just a G
Cocked up on three, blowing on a whole tree
See me in the drop, crawling down on boys
Right behind him is the Lincoln, my favorite toy
Candy red with the screens, and I'm riding on cream
Mean mugs triple beams, make reality a dream
Sipping lean sticky green, make em cloud the whole scene
Europeans what the deal, making all haters chill
While I show my naked skills, gripping wood grain grills
Running lights shining bright, floating smooth as a kite
Trunk cracked Fat Pat, breaking all haters hats
Where they at where they at, 'fore I pull out my gat
Looking good it's understood, flossing for my hood
Taking pride in my ride, like every playa should

[Hook - 4x]

Trunks pop, trunks pop, trunks pop
Tops drop, tops drop, tops drop - 3x

[Hook]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 1]
From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!

[Hook]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 2]
I flow for those 'dro'ed out; all my niggas
Locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, ""Still, y'all don't know me.""
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin'—feel me?

[Hook]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 3]
I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lot of beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top, and drop albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

[Hook]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Intro]
Yo, remember back on the boogie when cats used to harmonize like
Yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen, Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!

(Put them up, put  them up)
(Put them up, put  them up)
(Put them up, put  them up)

[Verse 1]
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again

[Hook]
Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

[Verse 2]
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (Like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Come again
Come again
Come again
Come again

[Bridge]
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

[Bridge]
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

[Bridge]
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

[Bridge]
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

[Hook]
Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

DCQ:
Four a.m. laid up at the res
Got a call made my heart jump out my chest
My man's got beef at the dance, exits is blocked
Enemies outside with they heat on cop
He's says that if he goes outside
He knows he goin' get clapped
My man from way back
Ain't going out like that
He got peoples in the club and his ties is strong
But he know that they can only hold it down for so long
So now he's trapped off and he's calling on me
To come and represent like I'm G.O.D
Of course I must agree, cuz this is family
If tables was turned he would do it for me
So now I'm hopping out my bed
Ready put a nigga never seen 'pon dead
Guess a black man can't have no peace
Pull out my heat
Woke up out my sleep over crosstown beef

CHORUS:
Crosstown beef be like crosstown traffic, thick!
Brothers be on some real shit
Everyman get scared when prepared for confrontation
""When the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation""
Crosstown beef be like crosstown traffic, thick!
Brothers be on some real shit
Everyman get scared when prepared for confrontation
""Getting closer to God, in a tight situation""

Mos Def:
Yo check it
It was a Friday in the month of may
Around the time when everybody put they game on play
See my girl was out of T so it was all on me
I figured I would hit the metro on the mad L.D
Now everybody know what the spring time is about
Players polish up they game cause the shorties be out
I was rocking jew-els and my wears was crisp
My man said there was a jam that I should not miss
I hopped in the livery without a moment to spare
And when I rolled up on the function everybody was there
I was catching sexy stares from the shams in the rear
Saw my peers and heads I haven't seen in years
Now I was getting caught up in the nightlife mix
Then I see my main man from my old time clique
""Oh shit, not my nigga Mos Def in the house""
""Oh shit baby-paw, I ain't know you came home""
We talked about that and this and way back since
When I seen a caravan sporting wild dark tints
Had its window half cracked and was cruising slow
And was circling the block like they was po-po
Said I was jibbing with my man so I paid it no mind
That's when the shots rang out from the passenger side
It was a forty-five bark that made us all duck down
Girls was letting out screams as shells hit the ground
I was looking for my man so we both could split
That's when he turned to me and said ""yo Mos I'm hit""
I guess the street life don't leave a nigga alone
Laced up at the party and he just came home
If he survive I know he goin' retaliate
If he don't, they bought theyself a burial plate
Either way situation status on code red
I'm on the horn to tell the fam its on like ConEd

CHORUS

[Phone ringing...] [DCQ] Eh yo, son get that?

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie
Then niggas wonder why niggas wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain with mad shit on my brain
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is
New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is with it; you want it, come and get it
Took it, then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew
Don't know what we're goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
When you find out there's some mo' niggas
That's runnin' with yo' niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up, like a candle, just ‘cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight, then you haven't met the apes

[Hook]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 2]
Is y'all niggas crazy? I'll bust you and be Swayze
Stop actin' like a baby; mind your business, lady!
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah, I know, it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down, watch my niggas spit rounds
Make y'all niggas kiss ground, just for talkin' shit, clown
Oh, you think it's funny? Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean, come up off that green
Rob niggas on ravine, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
Ayo, I'ma slave 'til my home is a grave
I'ma pull capers, it’s all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors, and now they wanna rape us

Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop

[Verse 3]
Look what you done started, asked for it, you got it
Had it, should've shot it, now you're dearly departed
Get at me, dawg, did I rip shit? With this one here I flip shit
Niggas know when I kick shit it's gon' be some slick shit
What was that look for when I walked in the door?
Oh, you thought you was raw?! Boom! Not anymore
‘Cause now you on the floor, wishin' you never saw
Me walk through that door with that .44
Now it's time for bed, two more to the head
Got the floor red, yeah, that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, it's goin' down in history
Niggas ain't never did shit to me
Bitch-ass niggas can't get to me
Gots to make the move, got a point to prove
Gotta make them groove, got 'em all like, ""Ooh!""
So to the next time you hear this nigga rhyme
Try to keep your mind on gettin' pussy and crime

[Hook]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Outro]
Talk is cheap, mothafucka!

[Verse 1]
Aiyyo! Rhyme or crime, let's get it on
MC's wanna eat me but it's Ramadan
Peep what's on the arm, when it's ice it's ice
When I'm right, I'm right, when you're wrong, you're wrong
I'm the bomb, records is platinum, skin is bronze
Flows all night like vintage Dom
Been this nice since umm, the first Prince bomb
Before ""The Artist Was Known As"" wit my grown ass
Haters said it won't last, know how many birds I flown past
Celly on roam, full belly, first class
And I don't play, I watch them pockets
Know y'all niggas go broke after you cop them watches
See you in the club, no bub' nigga pop it
Then you wanna fuck, give it up nigga, not this
My coat is ostrich, flow is the hottest
You ain't got dough, you can't go with the Fox bitch

[Hook]
You can catch me at the hot spot cause I Fox, I plots
At the bar y'all, all night, I pops
Is it alright, sho' you right, you can't stop it
This is our world, me and my girls
You can catch me at the hot spot, I Fox, I plots
At the bar y'all, all night, I pops
Is it alright, sho' you right, you can't stop it
This is our world, me and my girls

[Verse 2]
Yo! Cats bustin out the six, cash flushin out the niggas
Platinum heart in half hangin 'tween the two tit-ties
Scheme on your team, lookin over graph pictures
Pick the finest, then I put it on the minors
Love, after the club, meet me at the diner
So you can bring your boys, we got ten cars behind us
Order a steak, a glass of OJ to break-fast
Hop in the car and head straight up Eighth Ave
The night is young, I'm likin son
Either he don't have one, or his wife is dumb
His whole hand numb, nigga iced his thumb
Pull up my tights some, enticin him
You can handle the work, I'll play wit it
Til he curve and swerve nigga, stay wit it
Bitches in the club they, hated it
Cause I put my mack down then I, skated it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You can catch me at the Expo', Jacob Jav
Knocking Jigga out the Navigator, layin back, I stay in that
Me fallin off? Imagine that, it's not the case
I'm sittin' on Top of the World like Brandy and Mase
You wanna, buy me a drink, nigga hand me a case
Big ballin bitch, I want all of this shit
Six AMG's with the spoiler kit
Chromes from the fac', phones front and back
CoCo, flow, niggas is wantin that
Out they vehicles, niggas is bumpin that
I heard you wanna stop Fox, tell me how so
I got that New York, to the Dirty South flow
Whole album hot, even the outro
This time around I'm tryin to do about fo'
This is for my niggas and bitches who count dough
And y'all in the club I make em bounce

[Hook]

[Outro]
Hot spot (pause), bar y'all (pause)
Alright (pause), our world (pause)

BEYOTCH!
Short Dog's in the house, once again with this pimp shit

Chorus:
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna have sex say hell yeah

Verse 1: Too $hort
I met this girl in Atlanta
She let a nigga fuck but I still can't stand her
The pussy wasn't good I said ""What's up bitch?
I'm tired of fuckin' can you suck dick?""
She said ""No"", but she had another friend
So I switched like a real pimp
Laying on my back with my dick in her mouth
I said ""Beyotch!!  What you talkin' 'bout?""
She mumbled something, I don't know what she said
Smoking on a joint gettin some bomb-ass head
Bitch said her name was Theresa
All on my dick like cheese on pizza
In the A-T-L where the grass is greener
I fucked Nina, Melina, Sabrina and Tina
When I first moved out there, I met Holly
Five-foot one with a bad ass body
Freaky little bitch she was a Gemini
She used to stand up and say ""Shoot it in my eye!""
I met another girl went to Spellman College
Every day after school I aquired the knowledge
I took her to my house so I could get some
I fucked her real good and made the bitch cum
She was hella limber, said her name was Amber
She wouldn't stop screaming, that's all I remember
I had another freak, her name was Wendy
When I first met the bitch she said ""Please don't pimp me!""
I did it anyway
I'm coming straight from Oakland, C-A
Ain't no other way, like my girl Shante
She lives in Atlanta, but she comes from the Bay
Let me hit that hometown pussy on the strimp
Look out for a nigga, treat me like a pimp
You know I can't forget about the strippers
Cinderella with the glass slipper
Top down in the Benz ain't spendin' no ends
Fat bag of indo, bring all your friends
It's like Lotto, you get a quick pick
Bitches said they heard I had a big dick
So I showed it to 'em, only took one second
Dick rock hard, bitches gettin' nekked

Chorus:
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna have sex say hell yeah

Verse 2: Too $hort
I know another bitch, her name is Terri
I lied to the bitch ""It's about time I get married""
I couldn't see me pimpin' her
So I fucked her next door neighbor, Jennifer
She had two roommates, Cindy and Amy
Terri caught me creepin' and said ""Nigga don't play me!""
But them hoes liked to freak
I used to send 'em new niggas every other week
I never would tell you all the hoes I fucked
These are the tales, some of this shit I made up
I change the name so I can rhyme and shit
So if it's you, you know the time bitch!
I spent the night with Monique in between the sheets
It was her, her girlfriend April and me
I do it on the regular, two at a time
Call it what you want I be a fool wit' mine
Like them Texas niggas, I never would change
Like my niggas up in Cleveland spit the good game
These hoes recognize when I come in the door
I ain't trickin bitch, so what you want me for?
Like Natalie, swearin' up and down I had to be the one
Bitch lets have some fun
I fucked her, you thought I didn't
Short Dog's in the house and I keep on pimpin'
So then I fucked the twins, Sharon and Karen
Went straight for the panties, but they wasn't wearin 'em
Don't ask me who I fucked first, it ain't my fault
In the end, I still got the same results

Chorus:
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna have sex say hell yeah

Verse 3: Too $hort
Hell yeah, I never would forget Charlene
We was layin real close like two sardines
Talkin', laughin', kissin' and shit
Next thing I know she started kissin' my dick
You know the rest, before she left I paged Mia
I told her ""I got a new freak over here""
She rushed over, I left and when I came back
Them hoes was lickin' cats
They call me ""Short"" when I'm pimpin', ""Dog"" when I'm mackin'
Gotta get the money, thats all thats happenin'
She wants to be my love slave, I need some bug spray
To keep these hoes away
I never would tell you all the hoes I fucked
These are the tales, some of this shit I made up
I change the name so I can rhyme and shit
So if it's you, you know the time bitch!

These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna get fucked say hell yeah (hell yeah)
Beyotch!
And it don't stop
Old school Short Dog
Still spittin' it
Still gettin' it
Gettin' that money
Eastside baby, Oakland
You ain't knowin?
Beyotch!

Yo, bless the steel, step out dressed to kill

Clock the squeal, the MC overkill
Certified cylinders 35 mil'
Jumpin out planes, Doc's Da Name
Cock the flame, back to relieve the pain
Hater, IKSRFO don't Piscopo
Hit the safe for cake, shoulda switched the code
Nigga, sneak a pound through custom drug hounds
Bound to rob your neighborhood Waldbaum's
Me and my man jumpin' out Sedans
Tappin' your jaw, like Sugar Ray did Duran
I, execute like wars in Beirut
Twenty-two inch rims to parachute out the Lex Coupe
The rhythm hit 'em without the venom in 'em
Pin 'em skin 'em with the shit, I pull out the John Lennon
Ha, dog style your girl, smokin' a lot
I been had a demo before ""Ridin' High""
Buy a whip straight up, cash out the car lot

Choose the date, today you hallucinate
Smokin me out without war, torn, ghettoes
Opposite of Goodfellas, Dinero
Go to any borough who rock the mic thorough
Got your wife sayin, ""Not tonight, hello!""
Money talk, bullshit walk, ask Chris
The baptist, roll Garcia's with hashish
You need classes for practice to tap this
Jurassic crab shaft nasty ass bitch
Hot potato, drop the data
Guard your Emancipation Proclimator
Lock shit down, cock the pound - no doubt
As a juvenile, brought cazals off canal
Brick City be the pros at wildin' out
Off at the mouth, get dressed like Thousand Isle
Got a degree, on the hash and the leaky
Crash in the V while we Master the P
I beez Bout It Bout It, causin low mileage
Blacka, make Zsa Zsa Gabor cha-cha
Spit somethin to you then turn your eyes cockeyed
Down with the Outz - ah ha ha, ha ha!
Yo tremblin, pickin up the pen again, adrenaline
Got impact like DJ threw on ""Benjamins""
Sentiment, hit you with your thongs and your Timberland
Fuck ya, rob ya, cops say, ""It's them again!""

INTRO (scratched):
-Yes, ah ha, I like the rhyme-(scratch)-the rhyme-(scratch)-the rhymes
-All of us are born with a miraculous ability to determine the direction
[Whistle] from which sounds approach us
-Let us (scratch) venture into new and un-chartered land
-People get shook up ya know when I'm introduced as God

[VERSE 1]
Energetic, poetic and athletic
You know I get down and dirty when it's time to set it
I'm tearin' through, clean your scene like ammonia
I drown ya, flood four corners, the perimeter
I wonder, cause earthquakes bolts of lightning
You couldn't test the one and only Mic Titan
Afu-Ra, now you hear it now you know it
The body of the life force came forth just to show it
Crucial, lyrical style ain't what it used to
Microphone check one two
I hit the atmosphere, give emcees visions of comets
Technique kicked by force the earth I hit and bomb it
Immaculate, conception with the weapon
Emittin' mind bogglin' forms to mental sections
Beats is cooked, base burnin' like it's lava
Throwin' shit together more iller than Mcgyver
I never tire, spirit live like a wire
I came to let you know fantasies burn like desires
Before I go, on this mic I show pity
Coast to coast I whirlwind through cities

CHORUS:
Yeah, I whirlwind through cities
Influential, Scientifical power
My mental violence will shower
Devour, at a crazy rate

[VERSE 2]
Enterprising, uprising surprisin'
Ultra-sonic, mind like bionic
Gets ya body up just like a roots tonic
It's ironic, negative broke to north
I hit the crowd up and scorch off like Molotov
Stadiums is ripped in half, the diameter
Of area, mathematics, straight up scarin' ya
Face to face, cheek to cheek eye to eye
Now many wish to battle but never wanna die
So they kick it, bout the finer things in life
Yes rings is nice yes but knowledge skills be priceless
And so I radiate platinum diamonds luster
Flavor, perform unique my cosmic savior
As the legend's told, the heavens cradled my birth
Time to get down for my crown and show you what it's worth
My energy level's about to reach the proximity
Perverted monk I whirlwind through cities

(scratched)- friends prefer to call him just plain God

CHORUS

[VERSE 3]
The intentions, of reminiscence is essential
On how I had dreams of a youth now monumental
It's comin' true, things I've said have come to pass
And emcees would get busy but still won't get no cash
Some talents get the stash with skills as half as yours
It's not about styles it's what the crowd you has applaused
This unified circle, slip up it hurts you
So I spread forth and my thoughts make miracles
With my syllables I'm killin' you, but never softly
I'm unique, my critique speaks of my physique
From Chicago to Cairo, skills like the mic
On emcees I make em think that I was Hiero
Glyphics, now the whole world can read the message
Fake emcees couldn't walk through my passage
Afu-Ra, shake the world with agility
Master self I whirlwind through cities

CHORUS (four times)

[Indo G]
Fresh out the womb, 1973
A baby boy, I'm ready for war
Now this just can't be
Wit my daddy
He don't love us, just too young to know
I love you mama, work real hard
It got us out the ghetto
No more dependin' on my mama
See I'm a cra... man
And I got kids of my own
But if I call she there
Somehow, someway
Indo gone shine like diamonds
Immortalize to my rise dodgin' demons and phantoms
Realize your situation, ain't gettin' no better
They building more and more prisons
I wrote my nation a letter
Conversation and hation
I talked to god last night
Like from last saw 6 phantom
And I'ma lie in twilight
Zonin', think I'm gonin'
Maybe bro hoe
Was I talkin' on that level
Crucifix on my door
Race em', rece em', racin'
Got my heart pacin'
Listen learn it's my turn
I'd a free mase em'

Chorus x1

The late generation 6
Never caught up in clicks
How can you haters
Claim you real
Turn in (??)
But anyway that stories old
Let me kick in the loot
I'm tellin' heavy understand me, baby this Gangsta Boo
Now all you wannabe's
Claimin' platinum LP's
I can't believe all you fakers in the rap industry
You stay at home at your moms house
Stackin' your cheese
Whatever punk, I'm on my own
Still stackin' g's
I'm young in ages
Only the hair trick, I've been everywhere
I'm takin' flights to NY
Lookin' for somethin' to wear
I don't be carin' what you say
I'm hypnotized for your mind
I state it fly
Sippin' wine
Wit my 6's behind
Call up Chris
I'm in crystal
What you got for me baby
Me and Paul comin' over
Range Rover we're reelin'
X-O through the door
Cause we got plenty more
We be the one with the flow
Hurtin' all I fall

Chorus x1

[Indo G]
Triggas bleed the same blood
We killin' each other for colors and lovers and others
We can talk a long time
Smoke a blunt and touch faces
Rull laces, talk, pimp, and no slippin' and take it
To upper places
Like do you have a strong mind
What's your purpose in life
Begin it to end in my potion, I'm steady coastin'
Bustas look me in my eye
Turn around and throw crosses
Talkin' shit, your jealous bustas come and go like my (??)
Toss and turn, and burn and yurnin' for freedom in my sleep
I'm bout' to lose my mind
But them angels watchin' over me
Three strikes and now your gone
To the penetentiary
Word is bond, they won't capture me
I'm on a mission, I'm wishin'
Up on a star
Workin' on a meal ticket
While I'm eatin' caviar
I lie please
Bless my soul on my journey through hell
I know my bothers my keeper
My brother got a street sweeper
We gonna blast these devils
I know you comin' to get me
But when I die, I'm takin' six of ya'll wit me

And I'm ready for war

[Intro]
Excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?

[Verse 1]
Hi, kids! Do you like violence? Wanna see me stick nine inch nails through each one of my eyelids?
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is?
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said ""Slim Shady, you a basehead!""
Uh-uhhh! ""So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!""
Well, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else
‘Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off, and smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut! ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!""
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off

[Hook]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?

Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady

[Verse 2]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship
While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends!""
99 percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
So I signed it: ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole!""

[Hook]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady

[Verse 3]
Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (GET 'EM!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, my palms too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head
I'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had

[Hook]
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?

[Produced by DJ Premier]

[Verse 1]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born
Same time a man is murdered; the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking in light
Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell - NAS, NAS

[Scratched Hook]
""Nas is like life or death…""
""I'm a rebel…""
""My poetry's deep, I never fell…""
""Nas is like…""
""Half man half amazing…""
""No doubt…""

[Verse 2]
""Nas is like…"" Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
""Nas is like…"" Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death
The last one left, let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blastin' TEC's on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos, but what's it all worth?
Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Making choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is

[Scratched Hook]
""Nas is like life or death…""
""I'm a rebel…""
""My poetry's deep, I never fell…""
""Nas is like…""
""Half man half amazing…""
""No doubt…""

[Verse 3]
""Nas is like…"" Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, bustin' heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt
Learning something deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I’m like Pac dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
Combined in one man; like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces
And none of 'em fam
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like
Y'all play it your system every night, now…

[Scratched Hook]
""Nas is like life or death…""
""I'm a rebel…""
""My poetry's deep, I never fell…""
""Nas is like…""
""Half man half amazing…""
""No doubt…""

[Intro: Prodigy]
Done been through it all, man
Blood, sweat and tears, niggas is dead and shit
What the fuck else can happen, yo?
I don't think much more, son, word to mother, yo
We done seen it all, and been through it all, yo
Let y'all niggas know right now
Word to mother, for real, for real
That shit is the truth, I'm not lyin'

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
I put my lifetime in between the paper's lines
I'm the quiet storm nigga who fight rhyme
P, yeah, you heard of him, but I ain't concerned with them
Nigga, I pop more guns than you holdin' them
Make my route while the sun's out and scold your men
Unload ten in broad daylight, get right
Fuck your life! Hop on my '98 dirt bike
You try to stop mines from growin'
I'll make your blood stop flowin'
Take affirmative action to any ass if he askin'
Now here come the MAC-10
You's a dick blower, tryin' to speak the Dunn language
What the drilly with that though? It ain't bangin'
You hooked on Mobb-phonics, Infamous-bonics
Lying to the Pop Dog like you got it
You ain't no wildin' out for the Knife-Fist thrower
Rusty shank holder, we live this shit

[Hook: Havoc]
‘Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, ‘cause it's never enough

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Yo, the P rock forty inch cables, drinkin' white label
My chain hang down to my dick, my piece bang glass tables
Diamonds and guns before the fame, duke
A nigga like me hold TEC's, are you the same too?
Goin' through the emotions of gun holdin'
Long shotgun's down my pants leg limpin'
Killa B, you still livin', even my pops too
He taught me how to shoot when I was seven
I used to bust shots crazy
I couldn't even look because the loud sound used to scare me
I love my pops for that, I love my nigga D. Black
I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left
And through all of that a nigga ain't scared of death
All y'all brand new niggas just scared to death
I spent too many nights sniffin' coke, gettin' right
Wastin' my life, now I'm tryin' to make things right
Grand open some gates, invest in the rag business
Do things for the kids, the little Dunns
Build a jungle gym behind the crib, so they can enjoy youth
CBR's and VCR's, ATV's and big screen TV's
Nigga, please don't make me have to risk my freedom
We worked our whole life for this, you get your shit beat in

[Hook: Havoc]
‘Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, ‘cause it's never enough

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
It go one, two, three to the fourth
That nigga P-Double got that shit for y'alls
Peoples to rock to, stirrin' up pots of brew
In hell's kitchen, I chef the impossible
To serve hot plates all across the Unified States
Sit down and sup with the top rap reps
We the streets that's watchin', boy, move diligent
You better walk like a nigga on a tightrope do
Infamous first infantry, first division, fourth mission
First assignment, give 'em that shit they been missin'
My new edition's way bitchin'
Those that listen get addicted to my diction
Fuck rhymes, I write prescriptions for your disease
Generic raps just not potent like P's
One-thousand one-hundred CC's on the throttle
I peel off, chest naked on Katanas
Spaghetti head Mobb niggas is full bred
Fully-blown melanin tone, I rock skeleton bone shirts
And verses, but thirst for worse beats
So I can put more product out on the street
Get respect and love all across the board
We've been adored for keeping it raw
Nothing less or more, I score every time for sure
While the rest of y'all niggas just nil

[Hook: Havoc]
‘Cause it's the real shit, shit to make 'em feel shit
Lump 'em in the club shit
Have you wildin' out when you bump this
Drugs to your eardrum, the raw uncut
Have a nigga OD, ‘cause it's never enough

We bout to spit hospitable
Physical, but shit is gettin critical
The way cats bitin' is despicable
Pitiful, unoriginal, this shit is miserable
I'm a businessman, I ain't tryin to be lyrical
Damn it's a miracle, thought y'all was veterans
Wish your flow was ill huh?
Mine was your medicine
Now you're in the game
Lame sound the best you've ever been
Play right I'll catch you late night nigga like Letterman
Get thirty thou now your actions begun
Actin and fun nigga after taxes you're done
Cars impounded, New York must stop bitin and start writin
And start malice(?)
When the fuck we start bouncin'?
We stash ounces, make a nigga start clownin
We spark round and nigga that's your heart poundin'

In broad day on the streets
We got to change y'all
That's how it's goin for you
So here it goes, c'mon now

[Chorus x4: Buddha Monk]
Life's a scheme, it's all about the cream
Gotta get over life and fulfill ya dreams

[Buddha Monk]
I grew up on the streets, where shit was somethin terrible
Drug dealers, gun slingers and fuckin rebels
They was out to get knees to feed seeds
Takin mad g's, killin their own breed
Heartless to this game to get a gold chain
Never thinkin who they killed, skin was the same
It's too lazy to realize what you've done
Here lays the brother's dead victim's son
Things break out and kids start fallin
When yo' kid is shot, these three Gods will start callin
You lost your foes and you lost your soul
So ya hide up in ya house cuz ya thinkin it's the gold
Ah, now it's too late, they see you down that block
Aimin at that head with two nines, never Glocks
So take up and take heed my friend
Because now is the time, your life will now end
Cuz...

[Chorus x4]

[Buddha Monk]
As I stand on the corners with my friends, drinkin gin
Waitin for another nigga to commit a sin
Ah, there he goes, just walkin down the block
Thinkin that he's hot cuz his Glock rock knots
Sprayin up shit cuz he thinks he's the man
Robbin and stealin from the niggas in his Clan
He's trife, when he ignite, he socks light
He put seven of my friends in the past life
Yo, I'm tired of the shit that he's done
Let me call the Gods and get the gitchy gun
(Blaow! Blaow Blaow! Blaow!)
Light chunks spray all over the place (AHHHH!)
I seen the brother's face, put gun to his face

[Chorus x4]

[Buddha Monk]
Yo, next on the menu, from here we continue
A fifteen year old girl who wants to feed a fuckin kin too
She had big tits, long dress with slits
And every nigga on the block just wanted to dip
But what they caught was bad ways and bad decisions
That was one thing that the bitch forgot to mention
Late in the hall, sex on the wall
She's havin mad fun, you catchin clams on ya balls
It doesn't matter to this type of trick
Cuz she knew she burnt niggas, had a gun with two clips
She laid and prayed cuz the rent wasn't paid
Till finally, one day the bitch caught the germ AIDS
Now she feels that she shouldn't have done it
To my fuckin niggas, please weight ya fuckin garments

[Chorus x4]

(Master P Talking)

Yo Silkk and C-Murder just remember as brothers blood is thicker than water
And can't no man women or object infiltrate this family

(O'Dell)

When my TRU Homies call me I'll be there
When my TRU Homies need me I'll be there

Verse 1 (C-Murder)

Damn it feels good to be TRU, thats why
I gotta represent the tattoo
We roll deep when we creep in the streets
And stay strapped just like the police
No Limit or should I say the army
I feel like can't a damn thing harm me
You don't want to go to war with a soldier
Cuz TRU villains throw nothing but boulders
My click assist of hard hitters
A bunch of use to be thug villains
And nobody don't mess with nam' one of us
Cuz we make alot of bustas run from us
Ain't no such thing as a fist fight
You getting jumped, so you better have your mind right
Give me a call, when it's time to bang up
And I'm there, before the phone hang up

(Chorus) O'Dell

When my TRU homies call me, I'll be there
When my TRU homies need me, I'll be there
When my TRU Homies call me, I'll be there
I'll be around

Verse 2  (Master P)

I knew one day, my time was coming
But my whole world changed when I put TRU on my stomach
And (nigga) TRU stand for keeping it real
And thats why we ride for our homies when our people are killed
I love my momma and my daddy for planting my seed
But me and my homies reminisce over Hennesy and (weed)
And all my loved ones lost trying to hustle and bang
I make RIP songs just remember your name
And now Kevin you a legend
Even though It send chills up my body, see TRU up in heaven
No Limit is my life I love my job
Thats why I roll with TRU homies like Jimmy and Boz
And TRU is the tank
And me and Silkk and C-Murder we the links
I love my brothers over (bitches) and some bank
And when if need me, I'm there for ya blank

(Chorus)

Verse 3 (Silkk)

So I'm there when y'all need me. Anytime, now look
For my TRU soldiers, I put nothing in front of y'all
If something jump off, I'm jumping in front of y'all
Ya' know what, they bet not touch none of y'all
Cuz everybody gotta go, even if they touch just one of y'all
They say Silkk you might die, but thats my call
Wrong or right, they right cuz thats my dawgs
Thug living, living like sort of like a menace
Form with ex-cons, people on bonds waiting to get sentenced
You know what I'm saying
And I ride with this TRU click
It's No Limit for  life,look ain't nothing after this
And damn it feels good to be a soldier
I roll with (niggas) like C and P
???
Y'all my brothers when we fuss, I let ya'll win
Wouldn't trade y'all life for ten million so I couldn't fight over ten
TRU tattoos and tanks just Boz and V
Just two a few thats down to ride wit' me
I know y'all want to let me see y'all doing it on y'all own
But if ya fall never hesitate to call me on the phone

Bust led to the head plus I stay red
Everytime I think about the dead
I think about what Makaveli said
Fight for the one's who bled
And this MC shit we at V shit got outta hand
But they ain't stop the plan
Unaffective
No respect for this but my perspective is
Those who walk the path of the straight and narrow
We could rule the land like farrow
Plus enjoy the bone to the marrow
Delicious, eat an emcee for breakfast the break fast
Shatter niggas dreams like glass a ass
How many niggas wanna get with this shit mxed the boo's
And sit with this is what it sounds like

1 -	This is what it sounds like
When ya walk in the worldwind [x5]

I heard alot of yall try to dis the flex

Good try to follow buck but ya got bad luck
Next time you get your bullshit click to try to hit me up fast
Dont give em gas
Fuck if its the past I outlast the rest of them
Shot the best of them
Who the fuck wanna test the son
Guns got developed in the war we fight
]From the weakest to the strongest
I been on tour for the longest at night
I used to dream about becoming the star when
I first seen the microphone feened the R
In 86 and now im in the mix

So call up the doctor its
Time to rock you with the shit
So sit back cause when I hear it
Beat bodies, niggas man I flip its

Repeat 1

I used to hear beats
Buck with the baseline
And 1 thing I never did was waste time
Rhyme after rhyme I got
Tired of MC's coming with weak shit
Damn u need the BD beats
So I give it to you in the form of this
Not an alcoholic but I sip liquid lyrics
They put me in the mood to bug out (bug out)
Lyrically a victor weak you could get the fuck out
When I sneak huh I wrote a L first
Im thinking about this earth and how we walked this hell first
I hold on to this rap shit
See its the world in me music lets me be free its the only true girl for me
Im representing form 1, 2, 3, 5FT, Buckshot and Evil Dee
You knew that I was coming but MC's not came out
And showed how we get MC's got
Kid I got alot, but I'mma save it for later you tell me who's greater
When they rock with Beatminerz

Imprinted on my mind every minute
Make my plans and you always in it, yo

And even though we both fly
Give each other space and not the evil eye

And when we both do hit

[ VERSE 1 ]
My ghetto niggas survive and hold hands, we live
And old men embedded the game and aim 4-5's
And blindsided females, we mesmerize them
See, hell, we're live men, broke as fuck, no lyin
So what's up? I make a whole city get em up
And I know white folks is racist, cousin, I don't really give a fuck
Patience, don't be sayin that, sling the dopest rhymes like crack
Take a look around you, all your boys is layin on they back
Makin noise and bangin tracks, trained to kill on contact
Can't nobody hold me back, hate me or give up some dap
Take me somewhere off the map, gee, tell us where the party at
Show respect and then reject, the fellas don't know how to act
Blaze a sack of bombay, can we do it all way?
In school I was a fool, catch me screwin in the hallway
Ball all day, if I ever fall, it's on my knees to pray
Jesus bless my soul, needin dough I sold a ki of lley
Hopin it won't end this way, runnin from the D.E.A
When they come investigate, you better have your story straight
Ain't nothin poppin bout no broke nigga, black nigga
Fuck what they say, and get your dough, nigga, scratch, nigga

Don't let the ghetto snatch you, police tryina catch you
And everywhere we go somebody lookin at you
(Give em what they want, give em what they want
Give em what they want, give em what they want)

[ VERSE 2 ]
99 caused madness, who's rappin, uzi-grabbin, straight mack shit
Breakin these hoes' backs, foes hatin my tactics
Stainin your matress, displayin game when I'm at this
Tales from the hood, smell the wood in my 'Lac, it's
A trip, back to kick dust, nigga what?
Cussed my teacher out, got expelled, bailed to the weed house
Hell, don't underestimate me or doubt me, I'm great
And highly educated, bitch, all about my papes
But in the States down MC's can't's see me, straight from the underground
Niggas can't bring me down, that's why they start to hate me now
Escapin town and do all my dirt all by my lonely
They actin wild, it hurts, don't run up on me
Your wife wanna bone me, homie, that's in her nature
Ill, deal with that, kill that shit or I'mma waste ya
Brace myself, pace myself, gotta get my wealth
Make myself, break myself, I don't need no help

Who can I trust and put my faith in?
This world is tough and full of hatred
Heard it was only what we make it

Niggas is dead, dead I tell you, can't be serious
What you think is gonna happen
With three of the illest niggas together
Street music and so forth on one track,huh?
Can't be serious, it's Murda nigga, huh, it's Murda!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Motha fuckers wanna kill me but don't got the heart
To look me in the eyes with the nine and spark
Cause whether you're for or against this
When I spit with murderous intentions, everybody goes everybody knows
The weapons I possess they not for show
And you put dresses on your weapons when you walk out the door
See once I flash mother fuckers better do the one shot dash
Or be one shot ass
J to the A-Y to the drive by to your hood screamin bye-bye to you
Why would you fuck with me
Knowing I put you six feet deep and them niggas could die wit'cha
Cock the hot pistol and pop the hot Cristal
And promise you only one thing, to not miss you
Jayhovah know the god that served ya
Cause dead or alive when I arrive it's murda

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Shit I hope ya'll niggas know to lay low now
Cause thou shall perish if you don't bow down
Cause I hit em on sight, its dark dim the lights
You shot twice god bless to this the night
That alot of niggas fear the coming of their life
And you dead right be in hell looking for ice
Fuckin with Ja you bitch niggas talking shit
All on my dick you broke niggas making me rich
You gonna blaze me cause you high ripped off the henne rock
Flow semi-hot handling me your not
Check my forte not even on a bad day you beat this
Rather beat your dick or your bitch
My flow be the sick shit, gravely ill
Niggas dying cause they know I spit like iron, nothing but bark flyin
Flows and mics, hell and night, go together like heaven and light
Niggas ain't seein my plight, It's alright
I let the world know I shine like ice
I bet it all I can throw a hard four in the dice
Cause I'm a gambling man, you should gamble with a gat in your hand
Spin in barrel and put it to your head
Cause we don't dance no more all we do is cock and spit
Dedicated to giving you nothing but thug shit
Think we playing, you undoubtable fall further
Fuckin' with I-N-C is murda

[Verse 3: DMX]
I'm a cruddy nigga, goin raw-dog in dirty bitches
And if I get burnt, I'm givin that shit to thirty bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again Poppy
I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend Poppy
Jump out the fifteen hundred like run it, niggas don't want it
Get it, Done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, made it scrapin
I made it fussin, bustin, I made it cappin
And lettin off wasn't nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, Cause you is a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit
You can't understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head you won't feel shit!!!
URRUURRRR.....
Let the dogs loose on a niggas ass
Find out if the niggas faster then the trigger's blast
A fucking snake in the truest form
Knowin damn well that what I do is wrong, plus what I do is strong
Niggas is makin movies so I gots to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructin
The blocks is not for frontin, So let me get that shorty
Cause you don't need that shorty
You don't know what to do with that shorty
You might as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor
Another 24, What you want, Money, More!?!
Them niggas did it raw, with no condom
You find em, sayin sorry he for what he said before I blind them
Get the flame out the four fifth, and there ain't gonna be no more riff
Dog you want a floss tiff, but would of made it to the door if
Bullets travled alot slower, and you ran alot faster
But they don't and you can't so don't think about after
Cause tomorrow ain't comin, so stop runnin
Cause you gonna die like a sucker

Y'all know the name
Pharoahe fucking Monch, ain't a damn thang changed
You all up in the Range and shit, inebriated
Strayed from your original plan, you deviated
I alleviated the pain with long-term goals
Took my underground loot, without the gold
You sold platinum 'round the world, I sold wood in the hood
But when I'm in the street and shit it's all good
I'm soon to motivate the room, control the game like Tomb Raider
Rock, clock dollars, flip tips like a waiter
Block shots, style's greater, let my lyrics anoint
If you holding up the wall then you missing the point

That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

[Verse 2]
Yo, where you at? Uptown, let me see 'em
Notorious for the six-fives and the BM's
Heads give you beef, you put 'em in the mausoleum
And shit don't start pumping till after 12pm
Uh, ignorant minds, I free 'em
If you tired of the same old everyday, you will agree
I'm the most obligated, hard and R-rated
Slated to be the best, I must confess the star made it
Some might even say this song is sexist-es
'Cause I asked the girls to rub on their breast-eses
Whether you're riding the train or a Lexus-es
This is for either or Rolies or Timex-eses
Wicked like Exorcist, this is the joint
You holding up the wall then you missing the point

[Hook]
Get the fuck up
Simon says, ""Get the fuck up""
Throw your hands in the sky (Bo-bo-bo-bo-bo)
The Bronx is in the back shooting craps now, what's up?
Girls rub on your titties
I said, rub on your titties
New York City gritty committee pity the fool
That act shitty in the midst of the calm, the witty

[Outro]
New Jeru, get the fuck up
Shaolin, get the fuck up
Long Isle, get the fuck up
Worldwide, get the fuck up

Wild shit
He said...

[Hook]
Oh yes you will...Be lickin my dick toniiiite

She said:'when it come to dat Ak, I'm on you dead'
'I don't suck dills'

What the fuck's the deal
Do you really feel if you don't begin to kneel you have sex appeal
Well I feel:

Oh yes you will...be lickin my dick toniiiite

[Verse 2]
My zipper went zip
I put my pants to my hips
She put her thumbs up like the father said ---
I was like 'shit, i dislike her'
She got her thumbs in the air like a hitch hiker
Ready to fight her
But instead I chill
I looked her in tha grill and said

Oh yes you will...be lickin my dick toniiiite [slurp]
Oh no I motherfucking won't

[Verse 3]
Ha, yo
I picked my ?condesending? booker
I put my nuts by your chin so when you look up

She said 'huh,what,ill'

Oh yes you will...be lickin my dick toniiiite

You would swear that she want it from the way she kiss my stomach [huh]
I couldn't wait to start cummin from it
Imagine if she doin it like she gettin blunted
You know, French kissin, puttin her tongue on it
And then she stopped
And I was like 'doggone it'
Stop actin scared like my house haunted

Oh yes you will...be lickin my dick toniiiite

[Verse 5]
I said 'boo, do me and I do you'
She said 'OK, go first, then I do you'

[And I do do do do do] If this is true [anything for youuuu]

Oh yes you will...be lickin my dick toniiiite

I got a boyfriend now *laughs*

[Eve]
C'mon, uh, uh, uh, yo, yo

[Hook x 2]
Gotta man that I think I'm gon' love forever
And forever, we'll be together (C'mon)
No matter where he goes, I'll be thinkin' of him
I'm gonna love him, I'm gonna love him

[Verse 1]
This nigga lookin' like love, no doubt sophisticated thug keep me guessin'
Said it would be a blessin' just to watch you undressin'
Callin' you daddy, late nights I'm layin' on your chest and
Stay reminiscin' bout the rest and, and how they less than
Trying to come between what we share, can't compare
Could have been left, but when it's mine I never share
Fight to the death if need be to prove that
Wounds from your wars, other bitches couldn't soothe that
Broke from a bad back I'm holdin' you down
Doin' dirt with other bitches but them other fishes drown
Locked in, for however long I'm playin' it smart
Court dates in other cities there I'm playin’ my part
Wifey, in ya life see forever be us
Passenger side of a Bentley or the number 2 bus
Tell the whole world, papi EVE don't want nobody else
With other niggas pick and choose but you, I'm keepin' for myself

[Hook x 2]

[Verse 2]
All my peoples thinkin' I'm delirious, but the love I feel is serious
Couples of the world, no comparing us
Been through fist fights with niggas when I see it escalate
I'm the getaway driver so my nigga can escape
Pull my ice for the bail, spending nights in jail
Drawing hearts on the wall with our names around the cell
It made a little craziness, maybe I'm blind
But for me to leave now lookin' for love would take a lifetime
So I'm keepin' mine, fucking keep me blind
Feels like heaven when we makin' love, controllin' my spine
Wine and dine, I don't need that as long as long as you wit me
And you bitches thinkin' that you competition, come and get me
My position is held, some try and all fail
Pussy piece a mothafucka', uh-huh, good enough to sell
Never leave his baby girl, mad cause he claim me
Only thug in the hood that was wild enough to tame me

[Hook x 2]

[Verse 3]
I'm the bitch he'll never leave, helped him build his luxuries
Carry stories that can hurt him, still he only trustin' me
Secrets never leave my mouth, even if they torture me
Always taught to hold the ground, that's why I'll always be his queen
Did some dumb shit, see him in the party start to flip
Curse him out on the regular just to make him sick
Disappear for a day or two to test his loyal ground
Keep my dogs on a short leash, controlling the growl
Open wide, I don't give a fuck, I'm swallowing my pride
And he fast to blast a cat that he think be on the prowl
But I'll never let him go, temper flare, let it go
Always be his extra back bone, quick to let a nigga know
Always by his side, EVE the apple in his eye
Us together ain't no stopping snatchin' pieces of the pie
Us together in our own world, what's his becomes mine
Exceed eternity with him we'll stand the test of time

I'm a manchild born in the promised land
Captain of my destiny, guidin my faith through the turbulence of life
See, in order to be who you are, you've got to know who you are
In order to get to where you want to go
You've got to know from where you came
Say, it was Malcolm X who said
""A man who doesn't have nothing to stand up for
Will fall for any god damn thing!""

[Shyheim]
Damn, Woke up again...

Down my face drop tears, it's like nobody cares
I swear, life ain't fair, sometimes I wanna disappear
Only Blahzay Blah', I got mad gray hairs, I'm a young old man
What part of ""Shit Iz Real"" don't you understand?
Twin got murdered, caught one to the temple
You ain't been what I been through, Can It Be All So Simple?
I got bad nerves, it's absurd, I'm disturbed
So, I suggest you watch the words that you blurb
Out your mouth, or it'll be a shoot out
I leave you stretched out, I'm thugged, inside and out
And it ain't by choice
I'm screaming out loud for love (AHHHH!), do anybody hear my voice?
Pardon the noise, I'm just a black ghetto boy
Went through the rain and pain, where's the sunshine and joy?
I can't seem to find it, trapped in the black cloud
Watching my life go down, to hide the suffering, I smile

[Hook: Tekitha]
Running these streets can be so
Trying these trying times
Manchild in the promised land
Who of you will understand?
Running these streets can be so
Trying these trying times
Manchild in the promised land, hey-ay...

[Shyheim]
My aunt died from AIDS, I watched her deteriorate
She told me fucking wit drugs, was her biggest mistake
Put my moms on to it, sticking needles in her veins
Being sons of addicts, yo, me and Cane the same
We packed bags at Pathmark, we both humped Tamika
We used to go to the pool, just to steal kid's sneakers
Rocked cut-off beepers, wore old clothes for Easter
Shit was so real, we had to split a slice of pizza
I was born at six months, damn, premature
My moms birthed a thug like, Afeni Shakur
I'm surprised I ain't crazy, from the bug shit I saw
I caught my mother buying crack on the first floor, before
I never thought I'd be in a cell, smoking the Newport
With all sorts of thoughts, running through my mind
Know I ain't leaving, caught, D.A. talkin jail time
I glanced at my mom's eyes, she looking like she wanna cry

[Hook 2x]

[Shyheim]
They say I'm an accident waiting to happen, G
Miss Ann from the first floor said she gon' pray for me
She had a bad dream, that they, murdered me
I said, ""Miss, truthfully, I don't believe in dreams""
Hope is miles away, from where I stay
Who knows the way? Pssshhh... shit, I'd pay
For the directions? My whole family's in correction
Fake friends half-stepping, I'm stressing, answer question
Can I trust you? Uh-huh, then I love you
Yea, if not, straight up and down, fuck you
Bottom line, real people do real things
Play your position... (running these streets can be so...)

[Hook to fade]

[Poppa Wu in background of Hook]
You see, its like this
You've got to plan your work and work your plan
Cause seeing who fails the plan, plans the fail
Execute your strategy and seize your goal
Cause see, persistence overcomes resistance

If you get jealous fellas you gon' feel the fist

Makin heads turn when we walk the streets
They all looked shocked when they see Buckshot
Before the show gettin out of van parked in the lot
Ready for the spot, blow shit up

Whatever you at, represent that on the map
Rest in peace to the wack, we wear all black
Huh, you can smoke a black or sip a Cognac
But, when the Moon is Black, where the Ruger at
What? Where the Ruger at, where the Ruger at
What? Where the Ruger at, where the Ruger at

Still in the heart of Bucktown holdin my crown
The look on my face was cuz I mashed them niggas
Word life son, I had to bash them niggas
You didn't know the Buck, Black Moon or what?
Like dice '94-5-6 and up
If I'm up inside a club then I'm lookin at bud
If it don't be a dime then it might be a slut
But either way yo, we gon' play yo
And we can do it from the night until the day yo aiyyo

Jealous cuz they see a nigga frequently

You can call Buckshot Your Majesty
Ain't another little nigga bad as me

When you see Buckshot applaud to me
Applaud to me, what

Got babies by hustlers and niggas in jail
Slingin for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sportin' Gators, gettin' thrills
Our honies wearin' Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill
Leave the streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar on sunset, then the sex is so high-tech

Now, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone
Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's in the throne
And we gon' rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man
But where you at now, you lamp laid in Mac's now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you CEO from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Two G's, we got the type fam with Mac 11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, Piaget watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?

Aaaow! (Boo!)
Uh, uh, yo, uh

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Microphone checka, swingin' sword lecture
Closin' down the sector, supreme neck protector
Better warn 'em kid, Mr. Meth's a boiling pot
About to blow his lid from the pressure, too hot for TV
For sheesy, too many wanna be hard be easy
It's all N'together, going all out together
It don't take much to please me
Still homes I'm never satisfied like the Stones
We don't condone bitin' see them skull and crossbones
Protecting what I'm writing
Don't clash with the Titan who blast with a license
To kill rap reciting
Come on, in the zone with ya nigga from the Group Home TICAL (Fuck your lifestyle!)
Put your lights out
Get the shit to crackin' got you fiending with your pipes out
Time for some action
Surfin' the avenue, mad at you, where I used to battle crews
Back when Antoinette had that attitude
Cover me I'm going in, walls closing in
Got us bustin' off these pistols, my niggas got issues
Again, same song armed with the mega bomb
Blow you out the frame and then I'm gone

[Redman]
Yo, I was going 2 buck we roam, cellular phones
Doc-Meth back in the flesh, blood and bones
Don't condone, spend bank loans on homegrown
Suckers break like Turbo and Ozone
When I, grab the broom
Moon-walk platoon hawk my goons bark
Leave you in a blue lagoon lost (true)
Three nines in the glove with Masu, D-Don and The Gov'
Right behind on a bus
Haters don't touch (what?) weigh us both up
Now my neighbor doped up
Got the cable hooked up, all channels
Lift my shirt all mammal
You ship off keys and we ship Grand Pianos
Sawed off shotgun, hand on the pump
Sippin' on a forty, yo smokin' on a blunt
Bust my gun y'all. Red and Meth didn't jump
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, laaaaa
Yeah come on, Red and Meth didn't jump
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, laaaaa

Got the blocks on off nigga cautious style
Yeah you hot but I'm ??? now
Put up the gun in your mouth no more talking now
Shell drips in the back, no more walking now, you cough for pound
Hitmen, slickmen can't bang with us
Clips & spit 10 nigga aim & bust
Can't discuss, the facts just clutch your mac
Hope your mans got enough heart to bust back
Can't touch you with the words, I'ma let my gat do it
Strap with the clark, infrared attached to it
Long-out scoop see if you can dash through it
Cause when the burner split I'm burning the strip
Through the closeup from my waist, the ? burn on my hip
What you know about that? 20 deep swormin with gats
Whaaat!?

[Cam'Ron]
Killa Killa uhh
Yo, yo, yo

And it made me so mad I won't do that song with you

Or do you stop flirting? Dip the clip in the bar, nigga pop something
Nigga outside the club you wanna pop something
Now a nigga drive through I got the pop something
Spin out the black gunning, no nigga we not running

RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN Killa Killa

[Lil' One]
I dont play y'all niggas, I spray y'all niggas
Leave bodies roasted, flame y'all niggas

D-1 told me aim for the riches
A cool kid scared of the big, i heard stories
Locked up in jail, that ain't nothing for me
Now you gotta be gunned down to be a legend
One vest, two gats just for protection
Never was a showoff, my guns go off
Kept it in the closet, damn it got to go off
Took it outside, blazed it in the sky
It wasn't just me, it was booze in my house
I feel thugged out, me & you can slug out
Bullets in the field now they coming in the dug out
Shut down the club-house, lock out like NBA
Ya'll niggas shine cause One been away
Bust out the barrell of a ?? ashtray
So dont ya'll get it wrong
Shots hit your mind & body
Watch the soul drip on when the clip on
Niggas better get long
Lil' One Nigga

Brat
Hey JD, why you be saying oh, oh
Is that like flossin' shit?
You just like walk in and so people say, oh shit, it's him
Bounce to this, come on

1 - 	Where my rag wearing soldiers that
	Love to watch the dough stack
	Never leave the house without their strap
	(That's what I'm looking for)
	They know just what a woman need
	Keep a big bank roll and a bag of weed
	When it's time to go down they ain't scared to freak, shit
	(That's what I'm looking for)
	Where my Rolley wearing thugs who
	Claim they don't love you
	But any time you want something done, they do it
	(That's what I'm looking for)
	The ball all night type
	Frontin', screaming, thug life
	That's the type of nigga I like
	(That's what I'm looking for)

Uh I get high, get mine
I like a thug in my life to get by
That's why I spit shine the pussy
'Till it get tight and fine
He push me over to the other side
If he act right he could hit it from behind
We can bump and grind all night 'till we reach a climax
Make sure you leave a phat sack for Brat
Till you come back for more
Six pack surrounding my belly hole, it's tight
You ain't gotta tell me So
So Def is the way that I flow
Made to blow, pave the road
Unfadable, capable to save your hoe
Wherever I go, stack dough
I'm looking for a nigga roll, that ain't broke
If its time to lick of shots he don't trust
Even know how to flip cocaine and when the funds is low
For the show stopper, this for the know nadas
Shit get mo' hotter, nigga holla my name
They follow me when I drivin' the Range
And wait for me to finish performing backstage
Never have a nigga yawning
When they keep up with the shorty
Weed pumping as strong as me
Gotta be the ball all night type
I like it every minute when he charmin' me

Repeat 1

Stretch out your arms
Flip out your wrists
Let me see what to hit for
I'm fixing to know if you can afford to cop
A couple of dem thangs for your girl to rock
When we stepping in the door we killing 'em
Let the heads know we ain't feeling them
Or affiliated with them
I glisten and glow, 38 caliber go pop
Niggas that wanna show off
Don't just stop
My soldier's not having that
I'm looking for a thug that'll kill for Brat
And make million dollar deals for Brat
And pay some of the bills for Brat
And just chill for Brat
Watch dough stack, been broke, am I goin' back? Nope
Need to know how to surround a bitch with stability
Get down, bitches, if he feel me, rich now
I can't afford to sit down, get bored if
We got hits out nigga need big clout
Don't crowd my space if we dip out
Running with some other nigga face he don't trip out
Never leave the house without weed and a Glock
Even got keys to the spot to drop the PO Box
And in the drawer when he find his underwear
I keep a fresh do rag in his hair

Repeat 1

That's what I'm looking for
That's what I'm looking for
That's what I'm looking for
That's what I'm looking for

Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

[Verse 1: DMX]
If I gotsta bring it to you cowards, then it's gonna be quick
Aight, all your mans up in the jail before sucked my dick
And all them other cats you run with
Get done with, dumb quick
How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bum shit?
Aight, there go the gun click, 911 shit
All over some dumb shit; ain't that some shit?
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club
‘Cause every time you come around, it's like what?
I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talking to
But I'm not him, aight, Slim? So watch what you do!
Or you gon' find yourself buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue
Or maybe they just saying that now ‘cause they miss you
Shit, a nigga tried to diss you
That's why you laying on your back
Looking at the roof of the church
Preacher telling the truth and it hurts

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind

Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

[Verse 2: DMX]
Off the chain, I leave niggas soft in the brain
‘Cause niggas still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fucking with me; and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on
That got you think that you Superman, I got the Kryptonite
Should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You're wack, you're twisted, your girl's a ho
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, ""So?
I love my baby mother, I'll never let her go.""
I'm tired of weak ass niggas whining over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it on, on the strength of the hands with them, man

[Hook: DMX]
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

[Verse 3: DMX]
I bring down rains so heavy it hurts the head
No more talking, put him in the dirt instead
You keep walking, lest you tryin' to end up red
‘Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
‘Cause you's a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga, push like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brung out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga running his mouth, I'ma blow his lung out
Listen! Your ass is about to be missin'
You know who gon' find you? Some old man fishin'
Grandma wishin' your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest

[Hook: DMX]
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

[Bridge: DMX]
One, two, meet me outside
Meet me outside, meet me outside

1281,13473,Common,The 6th Sense,24,2000-02-26,"

[Intro]
The revolution will not be televised
The revolution is here
Yeah, it's Common Sense, with DJ Premier
We gonna help y'all see clear
It's real hip-hop music, from the soul, y'all
Yeah, check it, yo

[Verse 1]
The perseverence of a rebel I drop heavier levels
It's unseen or heard, a king with words
Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occured
Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep
Through me, Muhammad will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped
Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that

[Hook (Scratched by DJ Premier with variations)]

""This is rap for real, something you feel""
""And you know, yes you know""
""Rap for the black people""
""Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy""

[Verse 2]
In front of two-inch glass and Arabs I order fries
Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes
I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies
Immortalized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved, I wanna save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Somedays I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th, sat by this little girl
She recited raps, I forgot where they was from
In 'em, she was saying how she made brothers cum
I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective?
Though some of that shit y'all pop true it, I ain't relating
If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like

""Dilated"" ""Mind created minds""

(We takin this worldwide) ""Every word is heat""

""Dilated expand"" ""That Platform sound""

[Iriscience]
Aiyyo The Platform, watch the stormtroopers swarm
The Death Star's more than the devilish dawn
It's where Evil and The Force manifest their form
It's no good without bad and no night without morn
It's relativity, balance, stability
It's creativity, talents, ability
Rakka shift the modes of the wizard and the warrior
Hip hop-up and move to strike like a lawyer
Quick to be like ""Fuck a rapper after what I'm after""
Friendly how you front, but behind me talkin backwards
Basically I'm down to build but stay ready for battle
Plus most of you goyim oh, I mean cattle
The catalyst, never rock the mic in vain
Energy ain't created or destroyed, it's changed
The Dilated Peoples hit you wit the Big Bang
And theories that the Red Shift couldn't explain
Platform

""You wanna front what"" ""You've done nothing""

[Hook] 2x
Aiyyo The Platform, takes respect to perfect the artform
At times a battleground where rappers get their hearts torn
""You wanna front war"" ""You've done nothing""

[Evidence]
Cuz when I step off, then step back on
Son you'll never catch me preach-ing what I'm not practic-ing
Word War II, Platform the illest flows
I know my hunger's real, I still get nauseous at shows
My motto, I didn't write but this I quote:
""It ain't where you put your words, it's where you don't""
End quote, and wit this in mind
Yo I bring flows more rare than black quarterbacks
I never got sacked, or pushed ten yards back
We could go rhyme for rhyme, line for line or track for track
And after that, the crowd'll react
To the future we are the magnetic attract
Two-thousand twenty, confusin no doubt
I catch the story of your life on VH1 Where Are They Now?
And as for mine, I'll be sixty in my prime
Still science and theories, and droppin rhymes on time
Platform

""You wanna front what""

Chorus 2x

[Iriscience]
Aiyyo I seen apathy, met love and know hate
I'm heavy on the mic, can you handle the weight?
Either you learn to adapt or you're sealin your fate
Only brave when you get more dusted than home plate
Rockin D&D wit the Alchemist and Babs
And after the lab, we send Ev to catch the cab
Platform troop, make moves and stay true
Rock Steady-Zulu creates a devastate crew

[Evidence]
Yo I Platform my strategy, mix words wit alchemy
Evidence, I won't get caught shot on the balcony
Between you and I, I'll tell you, here's the diff
Gun to your head, your dead, pointblank, I shapeshift
That's right, study Chemistry like Al
Life, use your potential or Steve Howe
I'm about to call it quits, like too much weight'll break your rack mount
The man'll make you move yo, so make your move a backout

""You wanna front what""

Chorus One: Ming Xia

You won't believe the things I've seen
Far beyond your wildest dreams
I've seen chaos and order reign supreme
I've seen the beauty of the uni-
-verse so peaceful and serene
In seconds turn to violence and screams

[Verse One]
I've seen true genius, too often elude the meaningless
Appreciation of this mediocre nation
I've heard the mindless repetition, of empty words without tradition
Turn original verbs into submission
I smelled this malignerance addiction, but I guess I wouldn't be right
If I said the blunt was like a baby pipe
THERE AIN'T GON' BE NO REVOLUTION TONIGHT
Half my warriors as high as a kite
Lost and they lost all they fight
And I've tasted, the bitter tragedy of lives wasted
And men who glimpsed the darkness inside, but never faced it
And it's a shame that most of y'all are followin sheep
Wallowin deeper than the darkness, you're fallin asleep

Chorus One

[Verse Two]
I've seen and experienced things
That'll push the average to the edge and swan dive to death
I'm two guys, multiplied by ninety-three guys
Evenly balanced seein evil equally in each eye now
Maybe I'm the most thorough worker on the job to you
Or maybe I'm the one, who was plottin to rob you
The fear of this beatdown, no women or no cash to floss
Makes most of y'all hustle ya ass off
From nothin to two mill', in five years I'll live to see it
Vanish in six months, with no tears believe it
I'll rock, twenty-eight years before the Feds can lay a trace
See they plan is to erase me, just to replace me

Chorus Two: Ming Xia

LIKE, your heart is warring with your brain
Emotional or reason, now which one do you obey?
LIKE, somebody callin you insane
When overwhelmed and blessed, bursting tears of happiness

[Verse Three]
Yo, yo, I've seen relationships that's so sick
Life long friendships so cha-o-tic
Thug cat bangin his chick but won't kiss
Drinkin her spit, when coppin a fix for dope bliss
I got a knife and a bat, to bust your brain, put the knife in your back
Once in the Life I was trifling like that
Like my man Troy, who lost his days
Shootin dice on worldly ways
And ended up in a early grave
Because once in a lifetime is rough
Twice in a lifetime you combat the ghosts of mistrust
Mentally cuffed, thrust by a cop thinkin he tough
You bust, Amadou Diallo is us, and what
Now I'm on my knees, beggin GOD PLEASE
SAVE ME FROM THE FIRES OF HELL
LET WATER WATER SOUL PREVAIL - cause I can't take no more
Who's that knockin, at, my door?
Is that you, Pete from Cobb's Creek, who died in his sleep?
We was playin for fun, now it's keeps
Like my man Mark I beat to death wrapped in a carpet
And left in the garbage, damn now that's cold-hearted
Ask Book he saw it, ""Yo black I ain't seen shit!
Kids in the 6, they flip for nonsense""
Poke an icepick, smokin that sniff, coke to preschool fool
And packin a tool, fuck you Mom Dukes it's cool

[Intro - Talib Kweli]
Yo, you sent out the signal right?
And this is what happened
The voice of Hip Hop got heard
Never compromised
This is how we put it down, c'mon!

[Verse 1 - Kool G Rap]
Throughout my thug life, I've seen the most trife
Like toast lightin' over the role of dice
Flash your whole life when killers on a heist
Sold them tight, get poltergeisted over the bowl of Christ
Who pulled the slice from cats aiming gats at shoulder height
Told you, right?  G be the one that come and hold the mic
And aim it at the whole vice squad that's out patrolling nights
Rollin' like every prototype *nigga* was Dolomite
One man be cold as ice.  Inside his gun hand, he holds for life

[Verse 2 - Rah Digga]
This for those who pose in they grave
Waitin' for they peace when the law misbehave
I say we fall deep, watch 'em walk the beat
Like, ""You can't cross streets""—make 'em all retreat
(Now) Judges and the jury be a little too acquainted
Ending up defendants when we 'sposed to be the plaintiffs
Laugh now cause soon the thrill stops
When heads get it on and start to kill cops

[Verse 3 - Sporty Thievz]
I'm sober, they pulled me over
What I do, yo? (what we do, yo?)
Po-po go, ""I'm drivin' too slow"" (cool, yo)
Eyes tourin' them, explorin' them (damn)
Four of 'em—that's why I'm ignorin' them (uh-oh)
Think quick, brain like King Skip
Before they bring this to some Rodney King *shit*
(Forget them fools) Naw, make no sudden moves
They reachin' for they tools (let's move)
You buggin', dubes
Kirk, you ran the stop?  (nah) Word, them pigs frontin' (uh)
Yo, tell like you tell 'em cousin—we ain't did nothin'
All they see is three blacks in a jeep with seats back
Lookin' for G-packs, how the blood dog can eat that
They thirstin' for a reason to blast, you can't peep that
Gats and a badge to match—you can't beat that, so bounce 'em

[Hook 1 - Mos Def]
My people unite and let's all get down
We gotta have what?  Love, peace, and understandin'
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight

[Hook 2 - Mos Def]
My people unite, hop up, and do it right
We gotta have what?  Love, peace, and understandin'
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight
My people unite, hop up, and do it right
Do it right ya'll, keep it tight ya'll, do it right ya'll, just do it

[Verse 5 - Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Blood on my mans, destroying the fam'
More soldiers die, another mother cries
Anthony Baez, Eleanor Bumpurs, Diallo
Let it keep happenin' and there's more to follow
It's even deeper than that, penal shot in the back
Forever we fight and cuss, but the world still adjust
So many bullets just to stop one man
Is that the plan?  To leave us all dead in the street?

[Verse 6 - Common and Talib Kweli]
[Common]
I'm an opponent of violence
Too many of my guys have become moments of silence
Law takes lives and condone it through sirens
And night sticks.  I write quick
Hoping that
[Talib Kweli and Common]
I might hit somebody in the heart
[Talib Kweli]
Like a arrow with her eyes on a sparrow
Yo, I feel my people pain all in my bone marrow
[Common]
I'm tellin' Pharoahe to let my folks go
Marcs is singin' to law like they background vocals
[Talib Kweli]
Local, state, federal cops are being payed properly
To protect the property
How can I just stand by, watch a man die for nothin' and not react
The way we spit on this track is how we bustin' back
[Common]
Yo, I pimp slap 5-0
Get behind them and make them marks drive slow
[Talib Kweli]
Yo, you wanna know how to improve on the quality of life?
Try respectin' it.  Step in my zone with that madness and I'm checking it

[Verse 7 - Pharoahe Monch]
Cops, they transport me from Long island to Medina
With they *fucked* up demeanor
Dreamin' of stickin' it to me like Abner Louima
Pharoahe slash el-Hajj Malik Shabazz in the flesh
With plans of retaliations for you coward *ass*
God, please allow me to preach for him
A voiceless man through a spirit—I speak for him
Step to city hall, for delf, do it for dolo
With visions of cops inside the Public Enemy logo

[Verse 8 - Posdnous]
All that schemin' and plottin'
The young absorb like cotton
Especially in my city where the poor steady rottin' and
You would thought 5-0 would cut it all short
But they play the biggest part in the art of livin' wrong
In our land, cops guns clap more than hands
As if we don't deserve what they here to preserve
We just tryna do it right in these boroughs that we reppin' in
Why they tryna fill us with more lead than Zeppelin?

[Hook 1 - Everyone Lead by Mos Def] (x4)
My people unite and let's all get down
We gotta have what?  Love, peace, and understandin'
One god, One love, One light
One aim, One voice, One fight

Working the scene on the quest for lime green
Steady puffin on brown just for the time being
Battle raps on cock I get all up in your ear
Trying to get a record deal, battling somebody famous

Pounds to my girls as we slide up in the dance bar
Niggas in my grill like they really got a chance
Chicken heads trying to front like they not Digga fans
Say fuck yall!!

Tight takin over spots like my name was Robin Givins

After one or two drinks he ready to ACT FOOL!!

1304,13806,Eminem,The Real Slim Shady,7,2000-06-03,"

[Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam
Like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture {Aww!}
It's the return of the… ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around, grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though.""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes, then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes…

[Hook]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee.""
I should download an audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk, and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me

[Hook]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to
‘Cause I'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it
I just shit it better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can
Kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King
Spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

[Hook]
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Outro]
Ha ha, I guess there’s a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let’s all stand up!

Ayo my quality control, captivates your party patrol
Your mind, body, and soul
For whom the bell tolls, let the rhythm explode
Big, bad, and bold b-boys of old
Many styles we hold, let the story be told
Whether platinum or gold, we use breath control
So let the beat unfold, intro on drum roll
We be the Lik like E, Tash, and J-Ro
We harass niggas like we was the po-po
We can rule the world without Kurtis and still Blow
Finesse, from SP to Casio
Your jams ain't def, you ain't fresh, you're so-so
If you don't know us by now you'll never know
You set that mood when we groove and prove a show
The name of the game is survive and prove your flow
You can't out take Jurassic syllable
Cause it's survival of professional radio
Stop and comprehend and heed the words of my pen
Survival of professional poetical Highlanders

(Soup, you plan on rocking something fierce?) Oh, am I
Zaakir's the name, the A.K.A. super
The verbal acupunture from the dope old schooler
I used to be the brother for others that used to dumb on
Now they be the lovers of brothers that can't front on
Put me in the mix, LP 12-inch
SP, the elegant, poetic pestulence
I'm carbonated, the Fanti-confederated
Highly commemorated, and the most celebrated
For connecting it (Word!) Like verb subject to the predicate
Plus I got the etiquette
To keep it moving, and showing cats how it's done
Cause it's the verbal combat, position number one

[Mark 7even]
We keep it beaming like a beacon, if it's clearance that you're seeking
Whether black or Puerto Rican, people back us when we're speaking
We got the kind of rhymes that get you ready for the weekend
(To the mass amount of legions that came for party pleasing)
Our temperature is freezing all kind of different regions
The rhythm is the reason you're checking for what we've done
Please son, our thesis, will rip your crew in pieces
Your rhymes ain't ripe, homeboy, you ain't in season

Yo, yo, well it's the angelic man-relic clan repellent
My plan parent manuscripts withstand bullets
Flashing like a Japan tourist, we command pure hits
While you cramming to understand these contraband lyrics
My fam submits to pray, 5 times a day
Climbing into your mind with live rhyme display
J5 finds a way to remain supreme
Coming verbally Hardison as if my name was Kadeem

[Akil]
Ayo my team Dreamworks without Spielberg or spill words
Communicate from the Earth throughout the universe
I transmit, transcipts, transcontinental lyrics
Deeply rooted in your spirit
Up, I love the power of words, nouns and verbs
The pen and the sword, linguistic Art of War
No folklore or myths in my penmanship
The path of Scholar Warriors is what I present, uh
Verbally decapitating those against a
Jihad fi sabilillah, my words make sense
She gots to get up on your vocab, you gots to have vocab
Letters makes words, and sentences makes paragraphs

[Akil]
Yo, I make the pen capsize, the verbal with the planted eyes
Planning knives ever pair that I utilize
Spit juice, crack blood from your tooth
Inflict truths, speak Allah's 99 attributes

You baby MC's drink Pedialyte
While underground doesn't like you, the media might
But we the defeat will change that
As we bridge gaps in this lyrical grudge match, brothers we slug back

Yeah, we bless tracks with the help of a raw rap
Inprinted like poor tracks all over your brain rack
My mental maneuver will clear and steer right through ya
We Grand like Puba, understand that we move ya

Ayo, my rhythm reveal rollercoaster real deal
Revolutionize with active build
I plant my dreams in the field and wait to harvest my skills
For the starving MC, hungry trying to get a meal

Flamboyant, baby, for life
We taking over, coming to a theater near you
Check it out, come on, check it

[Verse 1]
Make sure my mic is loud and my production is tight
Better watch me 'round your girl if you ain't fuckin' her right
You damn playa haters never want to see me blow
Flamboyant Entertainment CEO
Yo, the spotlight is mine, it ain't his no more
When Lee come home, niggas can't live no more
And I'm straight, keep a Harlem World mindstate
I never lounge where you find Jake
Suprise niggas like a blind date, L rhyme great
And I'mma increase the crime rate for old time's sake
Run with me and I'm a make you a star
When me and my crew hit the clubs, we go straight to the bar
Leave 'em empty, I cruise through Harlem in an M3
Never pay for parties, say my name and I'm in free
I'm on some 100-G car shit, superstar shit
Selling niggas that wet shit right out the jar shit
I'm dumb hot, I'll wreck you and your young flock
Keep the gun cock, represent one block
139, nigga, the Danger Zone
We quick to put a bullet in a stranger's dome
I'm known to kick a rough rhyme and rock much shine
Yo, I'm out, I done took up enough time

[Talking]
We out, no doubt
You know how we do
Flamboyant for life

Big L, I'm a pimped-out nigga for real
Big L, Corleone is too advanced for y'all

[Verse 2]
Yo, it's Corleone and Queen's Most
We bust 'til your whole team ghost
Everywhere we go, we must bring toast
Forever poppin' the chrome, always droppin' a poem
I can write it or recite it off the top of the dome
However you want it is
How I'm gonna give it to you, Big L style
They brought it back to the streets ‘cause that shit sell now
So pal, back up a bit, give me some elbow space
I represent Harlem World, not Melrose Place
So I'ma lace the jewels up with nice baguettes
Flamboyent is the label that writes the checks
Y'all niggas better stop fronting ‘cause I might get vexed
And I'ma run up on y'all and slice yours necks
With the machette, pockets heavy
Slang more cane than Eddie; I represent uno tres nueve
Time is money, so I stay late, I'm quick to slide a playmate
Bust off like a tre-eight then vacate

[Intro: Cuban Link]
Let's have a moment of silence for those that ain't here right now
I know you're up in heaven smiling down
You might be gone, but never forgotten
Flowers for the dead
At times, I still hear your voice in my head
But I wish you was here instead
And all our precious memories, I'll never forget

[Verse 1: Cuban Link]
Twin, we've been best friends ever since we were little kids
So I sit and reminisce on all the things we ever did
I remember all the stupid shit I can't forget
Hope God forgive us for our sins and give you the strength to live
Far from sensitive, but I'm shedding tears right now
Cause I'm watching you fight for your life and I can't help out
Meanwhile, the doctor's shocking your chest, checking for breath
I was with you from the stretcher to the hospital bed
Not believing it yet, everybody sad and depressed
Counting your blessings, praying and praying, hoping for the best
Waitin' in bed, your wife duke shaking from stress
Breaking in tears and fear, cause dog, she love you 'til death
Next thing you know, the doctor comes out, just shaking his head
Nothing was said but I betted in his face full of sweat
You were dead, just all I saw instead was blood shot red
And I felt a chill throughout my body that I'll never forget
God bless you

[Hook: D'Mingo]
Flowers for the dead
At times I hear your voice still in my head
Wishing you were here instead
These precious memories I can't forget
(La flore pa' los muertos)
Flowers for the dead
At times I hear your voice still in my head
Wishing you were here instead
These precious memories I can't forget

[Verse 2: Cuban Link]
In my sleep, I hear you speaking to me and feel you reaching to me
Wish I could see you, though I know you with me spiritually
Physically, right here besides me is where I need you to be
Keeping me company and take over this whole industry
Memories of when we used to be too deep in the streets
If there was beef, we had each others backs naturally
If there was need for me to grab the heat, you'd grab it from me
And blast off with no remorse just as long as its me
Young indeed, we sat and chat on the block puffing trees
Guzzling Hennessy, playing knuckles 'til one of us bleed
You used to eat Rocks and read encyclopedias to me
You was a genius, even though you had no college degree
We were homies, but you will always be a brother to me
So close, we always gave each other kiss on the cheek
Big P, your legacy will always live on the street
And best believe I'm a be there for your wife and three seeds
Rest in peace

[Hook: D'Mingo]
Flowers for the dead
At times I hear your voice still in my head
Wishing you were here instead
These precious memories I can't forget
(La flore pa' los muertos)
Flowers for the dead
At times I hear your voice still in my head
Wishing you were here instead
These precious memories I can't forget

[Verse 3: Cuban Link]
Yeah, this is dedicated to the ones who never made it
I hated the fact you faded away, you were the greatest
So I say this prayer to pay my respects, I'll never forget you cause you special
I'll catch you in my heart, may God bless you
Rest in peace to my peoples who passed away
Best believe I'm a keep you alive always
'Til the day we meet again, face to face with a grin
In Hell or Heaven, you my twin to the end
And I'm a miss you

[Hook: D'Mingo]
Flowers for the dead
At times I hear your voice still in my head
Wishing you were here instead
These precious memories I can't forget

At times I hear your voice still in my head
Wishing you were here instead
These precious memories I can't forget

Rest in peace, nigga
I know you chillin', I know you chillin'

Look, don't bullshit me, scoop and come get me
(Shit, I'll be there in ten unless the Feds come hit me)
(I move like lightening, thats what I was told)
We can't trust these niggas, keep it comin' in codes
(we had a deal on the table since ten years old)
Was on Readyrock records, LP went gold
(we had 36 groups, but they cooked up Nine)
Managed 28 groups, what they cooked was mines
Niggas wanna act fly, we forced to hit 'em up
(and we just sold y'all a brick in code, so nigga what)

Chorus (Both)

Bullets from the chrome, Feds tap my phone, look (y'all can't never hurt

You'll fuck my bitch, shoot at my whole click, look (y'all can't never
Hurt us)
Cause we'll shake the Feds, take ya bitch, money long, we got locked we
Appeal the shit

Verse 2: (Mr. Mr.)

I pass through more bills than congress in D.C
Stacks so thick you think you see 'em in 3-D
If I'm outta town I phone home like E.T
Drive a CE, try CL fever
Move plenty coke, got more spots than Cheetahs
Got heaters, ain't scared to pop neither
Shoot you, them three, and him too
Thats my procedure, fuck you gon' do?
Hustle for all C's, you don't even dig
Chick, car, chips, cold ass crib
Best man at that, I'm the rap Taye Diggs
Most Wanted keep it lethal like Murtaugh and Briggs
A nice banana clip, I'll split your wig
I'm a gangsta, you scared to death ain't ya?
Carry more weight on boats than ten anchors
Southwest playboy like Hugh Hefner
I lied, and my bitch be out in one gesture
Cut coke open, give it a tongue tester
Face get numb it's good shit I'll bet ya
Jump out the Coupe, walk by and wet ya

Chorus

Verse 3: (Boobonic)

Nosey ass niggas don't believe shit stink
'till I cock the Glock and put two through his mink
You loose with your lip? well, keep your vest tight
357 Mag in a Jag S-Type
Don't talk me to death, you mothafuckas is just gettin' by
While I'm rich bitch, just gettin' high
You ain't on my level, you still admire skanks
While I'm at Vic's Secret photo shoots with Tyra Banks
And I'm not lyin', my advice is stop tryin'
I bust big shit that'll never stop firin'
Catch me at the bar whether it's the clam, shark, or sky
I hate when rat niggas start to lie
Dog, you don't got bricks
I never seen you in the drop nor with a bitch
You got your champaigne glass straight up, could tell you ain't never
Poured Cris'
Or bust a nigga with the Four-Fifth
Stop your bullshit

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Yo, sittin on chrome, sittin on low pro 20 inch Firestones
Grippin the road with the wickedest flow, Bis is a pro
I zigzag through a slalom
Accelerate and decelerate in and out the cones
Poisonous poems travel through Walkman headphones
Into your dome, Osteoperosis your bones
Who's the nicest nigga you know in the year 2-triple-0?
Spit turn to icicles in the mid air and slit your throat
Drain your carcass dry rip out your heart bitch
I write rhymes using your blood for my ink cartridges
Paleoanthropologists polish the bones of rap artists
After I dip in my hydrochloric waters
Can-I-Bus, with the seams burstin, perfect
Everyday the Earth spins I write verses
My sole purpose as a verbalist is to make my words twist
And connect em like letters when they're in cursive

[Hook: repeat 4X]
I prey on em, I spray on em
First nigga to violate I regulate without warning

[Verse 2: Canibus]
I'm faster than leopards running across the vast desert
At 22 yards per second to catch me the daily delicatessen
With 30 minutes to eat 'em, 40 minutes to digest 'em
And 50 minutes for it to pass through my intestines
So ask yourself a question: Can the Canibus rhyme?
Is a fuckin porcupine half swine?
No time to make up your mind, you wanna run or die?
Clip you while you running by, trip you up from behind
My rhymes confuse niggas like somebody tryna gangbang
Wearin a blue shirt and red pants
Throwin up signs with their left hand, standin out on the corner at Wetlands with a confederate flag for a headband
God damn eggplants, niggas gettin me vexed man
Cause I'm surrounded by garbage like Fred Sanf
And I can't seem to get away from it, I dreamt that I stabbed Leviathan through the stomach and ate from it
In my past life I slayed hundreds, in the life before that
I played trumpets to warn you that I was comin
There's one billion ways to die and I already tried
Nine-hundred million nine hundred and ninety nine
When I aim and fire my rhymes like a hundred cannon balls flying
Striking you one at a time in a parallel line
While the art of emceeing is steadily dying
That nigga Can-I-Bus is still in his prime, bust a rhyme

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Canibus]
Club Dodge - I wrecked that, Limelight - cursed that
Envy - I murdered that, Club SoHo -never heard of that
Wetlands - dried it up, Cheetah's - inside the club fired up
Looking for a chicken to tie ya up
Club New York - I heard it's hot there, beats be rocking there
Too many niggas be getting stabbed and shot there
Speed - I slowed it down, The Tunnel - they hold it down
Home of the underground, why they always close it down
Century Club -  the hot shit, House of Blues - I rocked it
112 ATL - that's the Dirty South bomb shit
Synagogue - yeah I be there, Caribbean City - roll deep there
Lyricist Lounge - they be some real MCs there

[Madam Majestic]
Tommy Mottola, lives on the road
He lost his lady, two months ago
Maybe he'll find her, maybe he won't
Oh wonder that love

[Ghostface Killah]
Brothers try to pass me, but none could match me
No girl can freak me, I'm just too nasty
Lost on the dance floors, I attack y'all
Snuck through the back door, guess who they saw?
Goldie and Ghost, black African Rose
Star-studded low lenses, plus the mural was dope
Airbrush W-B's, STOP! (Shake your body, body)
And cop a couple of these (She's a hottie, hottie)

[Madam Majestic]
Scottfree and Chauncey, very upset
They're sick and tired of living in debt
Tired of roaches and tired of
Rats
I know they are over

[U-God]
One in the head, I'm fed, this is how we doin
Put a Ruff Rider on my dick, bust right through 'em
Come out your shirt, insert the party rhyme
Fine Dr. Buzzard, Bacardi Lime
We passin it, takes the shake your Calvin Klein
Before the floor gets moist, taste and follow mine
Swallow nine, model dimes from Bahamas
Slim doo-doo makers stuffed inside pajamas

[Madam Majestic]
They'll take all your rhymes with a Colgate smile, hey baby
They'll love you one second, then hate you the next
Oh ain't it crazy baby, yeah
Tony's his name, the undefeated champion, whoa, yeah (Blow 'em down God)
Now he's alone, he's just the king of his throne (Yeah, aha)
Always will be my friend, Ghostface Killah (Truly yours, peace boo)

[Intro: Puff Daddy]
Uh, yeah
Queen Bee, 2000
Come on

[Hook: Lil Kim]
No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Won't you come and)
We are the number one
(Come and show me how you do that baby)
No matter what people say
We got it going on
Who cares about what they think
(Shake your body to the rhythm)
We are the number one
(If it drives you crazy)

[Verse 1: Lil Kim]
Everywhere I go red carpet
Gave the keys to valet tell 'em to park it
Then I jumps out the Azure, a Lil' Kim aura
Girls making faces like Ace Ventura
And my B-A-D G-I-R-L-S is in the stretch LX
Ain't shit you can tell us
Even got some of these niggas jealous
But tonight ain't about the fellas
Bvlgari perfume from a mile ya smell us
Model agencies say it's easy to sell us
We got sex appeal, I'mma keep it real
If I didn't have a deal I'd still be worth a mill', uh
Depending on how I feel I might go on a heist
So at my wedding I can throw ice instead of throwing rice
We fly like kites never gettin' into fights
I got a whole bunch of dykes on ninja bikes

[Hook]

[Lil' Kim]
I'm just trying to be me
Doing what I got to do
So why y'all keep hating on me and my crew

[Lil' Caesar]
Yo I'm saying Q.B
Look at them and look at you

[Verse 2: Lil Kim]
TRUE!
If I was you I'd hate me too
Louis Vuitton shoes and a whole lot of booze
Every other week a different dude and other crews
I make offers nobody can refuse
You might even see me on the channel nine news
I get paid just for laying in the shade
To take pictures with a glass of lemonade
My rocks shine like it was dipped in Cascade
(Uh-uh, Kim been fly since she was in the fifth grade)
Wake up in the morning to breakfast from a maid
Wanted me so bad you ain't copped or bootleg
Y'all niggas played like a high top fade
Some of the shit I hear I don't know how it got played
Y'all rock Versace and y'all went out and bought it
I rock Versace and y'all know I ain't paid for it
My fam deep with security in the jeep
When the Queen come in town everything shut down

[Hook]

[Puffy]
Breakdown, uh
Let's dance come on
Let's dance come on
I see you, let's go
Yeah, Queen Bee, do it like this

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim]
I'm the highest, your highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican but I'm speakin so that 'ju know
{*Rakim* ""This is how it should be done..
Cause this style, is indentical to none""}
The hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie
To the hip hip-hop a ya don't stop
To rock it to the bang-bang boogie
To up jump the boogie
To the boogie to the boogedy beat
Now what you hear is not a fake
It's the real Lil' Kim, Queen Bee (That's right)
Now I know y'all heard other females rap
But they ain't got nothin on me
Cause, y'all take to my rap cause my rap's the best
A hundred and fifty thou, sixteen bars nothin less (Nothin less)
So to y'all haters, I paid y'all no mind
In fact I'mma give it to y'all one more time like..

[Puffy]
Uh yeah, what?
Come on, bounce, what?

[LL Cool J]
I just want you to fantasize with imagination
Know what I'm saying, uh yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah I like that
Give me some more, some more of my vocals
You know sex 'em up a little bit
You know what I mean?

You're the honey that I see when I'm riding by
The one giving me a feeling that I can't deny
You got the Prada boots on suede hitting your thigh
Acting like my chrome twenties ain't catching your eye
Sometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror
Turn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer
You're turning me on, keep me standing up
I wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough
I come up to your job and handcuff your boss
Throw that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off
Then sit you up on the copy machine
Make copies of your kitten with my chin in between
Then I'll take you to the window so the world can see
Baby I'm down on my knees let your world be free
Pearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me
Multiple orgasms is your destiny
Wet dream, ride like you're going to Queens
Like I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18
To hell with your boss
Let that nigga hear you scream
Sounding like that screech on the fax machine
Then we can take it to the ladies bathroom
Make your mascara run till you look like a racoon
Touch yourself baby tell me it's wet
Squeeze tight so I'll never forget, here we go

[LeShaun](LL Cool J)
I'ma get you for your paper
Make you leave you girl
(Imagine that)
Make you trick on me around the world
(Imagine that)
Have you calling me your ultimate thrill
(Imagine that)
I got you whipped tell your niggas to chill

[LL Cool J](LeShaun)
I'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide
(Imagine that)
Me and my fold got my broads collide
(Imagine that)
Knocking girls off two at a time
(Imagine that)
Disrespect you and still make you mine
(Uh-uh)

Uh, imagine I'm your teacher and you stayed after school
You've been a bad girl you broke all the rules
Forgot your homework, chewed gum in class
And the only way to fix it is to give me some ass
I got a three piece suit on sitting at my desk
I kinda need a shave but my body smell fresh
You're wearing a plad skirt and long white socks
The vibe is thick baby, we both red hot
I kiss your neck unbutton your blouse
Let my fingers make circles on the edge of your mouth
Your apple's so ripe I'm your tutor for life
Got your beggin' me to put you on detention tonight
You could read the Iliad and the whole Odyssey
But no Trojan soldier scold you like me
Match the calculus then measure my frequency
But when you blast on my lap that's the highest degree
Put your hands on the chalkboard scratch it with ya nails
Give me goose pimples when ya put yo tounge on my dimples
Baby feel me now you got yo ass suspended
Got a letter for your parents but I didn't wanna send it
I stopped by the crib you invited me in
You convinced me somehow to sip some juice and gin
Then you take me to your parent's room and laid me on my back
You twisting, kissing ya fist like that
Rubber meets the road till the tire goes flat
I filled it up with air again baby hold that
You a bad girl look you got your sheets all wet
Squeeze tight so i never forget the teacher's pet


[LeShaun](LL Cool J)

(Uh-uh)

You was laughing with your girlfriends, sippin' a drink
When I came up from behind you and wrapped you with my mink
Guided you to the dance floor and held you tight
We in the Tunnel in the back with the dim red lights
I'm rocking the tank top baby nothing but ice
You rocking the baby tee and mini skirts and spikes
The club is so black we can't see our own hands
I know you feel that bulge through them Fubu pants
You bold huh, wanna feel it in your hands
Rub your ass all up on it cause you know that I want it
God gave you beauty and you love to flaunt it
Life is a song, you were born to perform it
Drink the Cristal at the same time
Get intoxicated till we lose are minds
The crowd seperated as we start to shine
I lift you in the air your skirt starts to climb
We tongue kiss deep in front of the whole crowd
The lights start to flash the music is too loud
We hit the back door and jump in the limousine
You pull up your skirt I put some ice in between
You're tired from the dancing so I kiss your feet
Even though we outside I hear the bass from the beat
Funkmaster Flex chop it up for the freaks
DJ Enuff make the mommies wanna creep
No problem uh mi spouse no aqui
Tu muy caliente tu vamos con mi
Si mami I'm the chaffer make it whip
Take a ride bet you never forget
Here we go

[Intro]
Yeah, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-d-doo, diggy-doo, yo

[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 1]
I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be something for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them, ‘cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light
But they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matching shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest
And hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most high
Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely

[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, check it, it's important, we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understanding and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 3]
It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to
Thinking you fresh, suggesting beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal, it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right, I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!

[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Outro]
I'll take my chances
Before they pass
Pass me by, oh, darling
You need to look at the other side
You'll agree

Yeah
2000 baby
Havana style
Miami Dade County style
Yeah, uh
What
How much you want me?
It's like this

[Havana]
I'm a bad bitch when I grab my tits
Throwed and dopeless, my cliques tha dopiest
Even my drops be explosive
Alley cats sit, they all up in my showbiz
A hundred songs done, damn you still ain't getting noticed
Erase tha T and add a V and notice
Y'all stay novice, rhymes y'all say is hopeless
Image y'all portray  is bogus
Hoes talk lip then they watching Oprah
Smoke weed then get banged and fucked tha hell over
Y'all hate and get banged them cats can rock sofa's
Like Spades, I crash game, y'all be live jokers
Certified cigar smoker, never losing focus
Why ya man is at my show, scheming how to poke us
Tricks get a Sly Kat, wit them tight chokers
Lip lock hoe's he got blowed and after that he toe dust
One single where you at?  Bitch hocus-pocus
So ya count is still tha brokest bitch, who tha dopiest
Now tell me

Chorus: (Havana)
How much you want me?
(Come on, come on)
How much you want me?
(Let me know, yeah)
How much you want me?
(How much you want me?)
How much you want me?
(What, what, what)
How much you want me?
(Yeah, what)
How much you want me?
(Like that y'all)
How much you want me?
(How much you want me?)
How much you want me?
(What)

[Havana]
While y'all bullshit on tracks and shit
Trying to stack a chip, here's a tip
Leave ya label cause them cats think you wack as shit
Tax write off, bite off the mack I'm packing wit
Blow ya lights off, I blink off like nothing happened bitch
Hidi feist macking shit, scorch you rappers wit
Real niggas that bang and forget names soon after it
Day calhoun activist, fuck all y'all actresses
Sharp as cactus is, y'all dark like  ??????
Have ya baby daddy stroke long on these mattresses
It's concealed like coke in packages, nigga what
See y'all aim, trigger stuck
Y'all duck, quick as fuck
I buck, hit you up, then ya crew picked you up
Watch how I stick 'em up, sticking all you cock boys
Black guards wit silencers, killing all you clips noise
Bitch niggas, no poise, quick niggas East Troy
No shows just Burger King is where they be employed
And tell me

Chorus:

[Havana]
Cut y'all cats like swiss blades
Out the pictures wit no if, mays
Attract the eyes of many like my Fendi Swiss made
Y'all bitches game be thrift made, not even worth saying
Wrecking fools wit feed back not even worth playing
While I'm at the game, it's trick hoes, chest eat out
Looking g'ed out, living market spree out
Y'all Bill Gates in 98, window style shopping
Keep hope alive now ya third album dropping
Used to talk shit, but now ya shits flopping
Head high and shit had ya whole city jocking
Even wit a rocking chair, bitch you ain't rocking
Havana's tha shit, get the Champaign popping
And tell me

Chorus:

"
1335,14068,Mystikal,Shake Ya Ass,19,2000-08-12,"

Mmm! Mmm, mmm, mmm
Oooh-OOOH!

[Hook]
Shake ya ass, but watch yourself
Shake ya ass, show me what you working with

[Verse 1]
I came here with my dick in my hand
Don't make me leave here with my foot in yo' ass; be cool
And don't worry bout how I'm ripping this shit
When I'm flipping what I'm kicking nigga, that's just what I do
I'm effervescent and I'm off that crescent
Nastier than a full grown German Shepherd; motherfucker keep stepping
They don't fuck with me and they don't
Y'all bitches can't catch me and you won't
Pay ya fare, fix your hair, throw that pussy
Got a Prada for bonapalies, and Donna for my babooski
You think I'm tricking? Bitch, I ain't trippin
I'm buyin if you got nice curves for your iceberg
Drinkin Henn and acting like it do something to me
Hope this indecent proposal make you do somethin with me
Fuck a dollar girl, pick up fifty
And fuck that coward, girl, you need a real nigga
Off top knick-a-boxers hurting shit
Bend over ho; show me what you workin with!

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Attention all y'all players and pimps
Right now in the place to be (shake ya ass)
I thought I told y'all niggas before
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me (watch yourself)
Now this ain't for no small booties
No sir cause that won't pass (show me whatcha workin with)
But if you feel you got the biggest one
Then momma come shake ya ass

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I like my women fire like CAY-ENNE!!
Chocolate and bowlegged - when I'm runnin up behind her!!
Go head do your job, pop the lock, let the cock out
For girl don't lie you know you wanna go back to my house
""The Man Right Chea"" wanna get under that dress right there
You spicy cajun we gon' a good time over there
You better suck the head on them there crawfish
And you gotta bend all the way over to dance off this
Handle yo' business but I know you do it way better, you dead wrong
So if you talking bout how niggas make noise when you pass by
Get yo' fine ass on the floor girl this yo' fuckin song!
Do yo' thang dont be scared, cause you gon' get served
You get mine then you gon' get yours
Bout to make yo' ass love it
Raise it up, show the G-string hustling hustling

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Stop yo' cryin heffer, I don't need all that
I got a job for you - the braided up pimp is back
Break them handcuffs, fuck you nigga move something
And if they ask you what you doin say, ""Ooohh nuttin!""
And we been doin for the past 2 somethin
And I've been beatin that pussy up not smooth fucking
You can betcha bottom dollar; if that pussy fire
You gon' holla Michael Tyler!
So don't act like you don't be backin that stuff up
Girl in the club, cause that's what you got ass for
Wobble wobble I'm infatuated
Bitch ride a dick like she making a baby
And I see that we gon' have to go to a quiet corner for just us two an'
Don't worry about who looking, just keep on doing what you doing
Cause a nigga like me gon' get to work before I know the girl
Bitch what's happening, let 'em see, show the world!

[Bridge]

[Hook]

Uhh.. OOOH-WEE! Good lawd!
Damn!

[Intro]
…Man, whatever
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo, this song is for anyone…
Fuck it, just shut up and listen, ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
That's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me
I don't know you, and no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me
My tank is on empty, no patience is in me
And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Hook]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
‘Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense
It's constant, and, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience'
Has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, ‘cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happening
Then attack Eminem ‘cause I rap this way
But I'm glad, ‘cause they feed me the fuel that I need
For the fire to burn, and it's burning, and I have returned

[Hook]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
‘Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
‘Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out
‘Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign you an autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad, ‘cause…

[Hook]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
‘Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

1340,14130,Too $hort,You Nasty,6,2000-09-02,"

Beeyotch!!
You nasty, you nasty bitch
Thats what I said bitch (you nasty)
I said you nasty (you nasty)
Fuck that shit, fuck you hoes (you nasty)
Fuck all y'all, man

Verse 1:
I used to get straight A's, read my books in Catholic school
Now I find myself in the men's bathroom
With a top-notch, goin wild in the stall
She ain't even trippin cuz shes havin a ball
I used to play with my toys in the back yard
But now I just walk around and act hard
Alot of women like to be called a bitch
I'll break it down so you understand all of it
I always thought I was an educator
I might not love her, but I never hate her
Shes the kind of girl to make your toes pop
Keep ya wide open, never need nose drops
Now yall wanna get mad at me
For talkin about another young, nasty freak
Its life, its not a major catastrophe
You ain't a ho cuz you givin up the ass for free, you nasty

I know why yall mad at me, I ain't break your heart girl (you nasty)
Man, these bitches trippin (you nasty)

Verse 2:
Too many tight lil dresses with no panties on
Too many females tryin to take a man home
Where your mommy and your daddy at?
Just because a player got a cadillac
You wanna lay in the back, with your face in his lap
All you gotta do is taste that
You get to ride, get used all the time
I ain't made the situation I just made the rhyme
Adapt to my surroundings, look around
Nothin but pimps, tricks, and hookers found
In the Town, if you ain't one you the other
I ain't fooled, what you gonna do to a brother
Lookin at me, like you wanna eat me
Didn't even have to use words to meet me
Now we havin sex and I forgot your name
You just a hot thang, nothin can't stop your game, cuz you nasty

I already fucked you (you nasty)
I dont know why you trippin (you nasty)
I told yall I was gonna call you (you nasty)
After awhile

Verse 3:
I understand where your anger comes from
Cuz Ive been talkin bad on the mic since day one
Never took the time to explain myself
But keepin it real is somethin I can't help
I know some real women, I know some real hoes
And male-bashing songs, I dont feel those
But I'm glad you bi-sexual women came out
Dont tell em what we did and keep my name out your mouth
If it wasn't for the groupies or for the oral sex they gave me
I'd treat you all like ladies
Im just a victim of society
Look me in my eyes and dont lie to me
You ever had a one-night stand and go to church the next day?
A full night of play, wake up and pray
Wishin you could stay, but you caint'
Oh you a good girl today? You ain't no saint, you nasty

Oh yeah I know I fucked you too (you nasty)
You know what Im talkin bout?
You need to take this muthafuckin opportunity
And have some big fun (you nasty)
I got some drinkin in the kitchen baby (you nasty)
My niggas comin through (you nasty)
Oh, its cool girl (you nasty)
We gon' work this shit out, beeyotch!
I ain't mad at yall
I ain't mad at you
Shit, I ain't mad
Cuz you nasty

[Intro: Phife Dawg]
One time, yo
Yo, you know what?
I might not always say the right thing
But I say what the fuck I feel
On the real
What the deal
Knawmean?
World's greatest five-footer back up in yo shit
Check it
Let me ask you

[Verse 1]
Who these cats, lookin punanny-ish?
For those who don't understand, that's some vagina shit
I think I'm lost, yo, tell me what you're dealin' with?
Niggas' rhymes be watered down like porn star clitoris
It's so ridiculous, you're soundin' hideous
Talkin' tough, but be dressin' on some wussy shit
Tight see-through shirt, on some hard nipple shit
Fake Versace shades while all up in the club and shit
Fake Rolex, it'll change the color of your arm and shit
Sports bras, halter tops, what the fuck is this?
Dudes be brought up just to sell some records? SHIT
Then wanna be voice of the streets, you see this bullshit?
Wait... if you gon' half-step in hip-hop, you need to stop
This here remains in the street, play puss, you're gettin' fucked
Go 'head, play yourself with them ho-like hooks
Sing ballads if it's all about the Maxwell look
Mack make-up with a pair of [brand name] thinkin' you're cute
Fubu suit with Steve Madden boots make me wanna puke
Phat Farm shorts with a garder belt, lookin' like a whore
Or a purple bandanna cause it matches your shaw?
Now tell me, what you rhymin' for?
This shit is all about flows, fuck a fashion show
Hip-Hop 101, Professor Diggy, yo
And if you want it laid back, call Kenny Lattimore
No disrespect to these men, cause I like R&B
But right here in my class we gonna emcee
It's all about the zigga-zigga, yeah, the scratch 'n' cut
Graffiti art, jammin' in the park, holdin' your nuts, motherfuckers

[Hook]
I am hip-hop, I walk hip-hop, I talk hip-hop
I need hip-hop, I lust hip-hop, I love hip-hop
B-Boy round the clock, doin' it non-stop
Flawless!
Diggy gon' hit you with the rawness
Pass me the mic and I'mma scorch it
And when mi done with it, mi just toss it
But never force it
My shit is flawless
Mutty Ranks hit you with the rawness
Pass me the mic and I'mma scorch it
And when mi done with it, mi just toss it
But never force it

[Verse 2]
Peep the Groove Attack ensemble, we about to fly high
Fuck majors, we independent like the 4th of July (Why?)
I guess we didn't really share the same vision
But it was their decision
Them fuckers just wouldn't listen
But now look who's bitchin'
While Phifey cuts with precision
It's my ass they're kissin'
Don't worry 'bout what I'm shippin'
As for Jive, I know they hate on how I blow up the spot
How quickly they forget what got they ass to the top
What they figure, I bust my ass to feed they dirty-ass kids?
Get the fuck out of here, fuck am I, Britney Spears?
These cats'll turn you against your brethren if you let em, and how
It's the reason me and my former partner don't talk now
Communication is the key, capital word be unity
These folks will guide you to your grave, then come and read the eulogy
Independent like Philly, majors can't do shit for me but suck mi toe
Go find a MC with some half-assed flow
But I understand these styles, they just quickly endin' now
Forever wantin' to play games, but guess what, I'm not a child
For the new breed of MC's: learn to own your shit, gee
Stay black, keep it real, purchase at [Name]
Fuck a waiting to exhale, Malik is at once released
While all you so-called CEO's and A&R's get impeached
Say Fudge - you shoulda never let me off the damn leash
Ha-ha! Arrrf!
Now break it down now

[Hook]
I am hip-hop, I sleep hip-hop, I want hip-hop
I love hip-hop, I lust hip-hop, I need hip-hop
B-Boy round the clock, doin it non-stop
And I'm
Flawless
Diggy gon' hit you with the rawness

Yo, once the Mo start drippin
Hoes start trippin
Tell em my name Boo
You know we all hittin
But look mami
I got 3 drinks in me stuck
And I ain't tryna talk, I'm tryna fuck
If the pussy gets wetter
Chicks, I never sweat her
I'm gettin all the cheddar
Bitch, read the letter
I pattened the plan
Get a dick suck wit a gat in my hand
Bitch, it's thug passion
Chicks drive by in their whips
They be flashin
Do you know Bonic and Lib?
They be askin
If the bitch wanna ask me shit, I'mma hit
Attitude just like Cancun, I'mma trip
Now niggas pissed
Know why? Cause I'm the shit
If you cop a 5, imagine what I'm gone get
Lights out
Most Wanted bring the bikes out
Ball out
Bitches on the back
Ass all out
I got hoes wit accents
And I don't mean Hundai's
My hands touched more bricks than Quamay's
Ice'll blind you
For real dog, believe me
Only feel comfortable around Ray Charles and Stevie
So I'mma take it easy

Now is you bout it mami?
Whoa, let me know
Is it the dick, the car, the looks, or the dough?
She said, ""Mostly the dough, playa I don't lie.""
I hit once, then hit her girlfriend
Ask, ""When can we all get together again?""
And I never love hoes
What you talkin about?
I party your wife, nigga
You be eatin her out
And I sat there and told you that I cum in her mouth
And my connect the only reason she be runnin down south
Bitches high for a ride dependin who key startin

Cop a Aston Martin, pardon
No talkin, Mr. say sparkin
Niggas can't understand
They still walkin

So why don't you run across the border mama?

Hot ass whips is what they see Boo in

Uh, nice wit the O flex outta line
Cut a bitch off like O.J

That's why all yall niggas look hurt
When yall see me
More Franklin's than Kirk
And I'm spendin em wit GP
Thick tube socks I rock like I'm from DC
Cash Money ????? Juvenile like BG

[Part 3: Mr. Man]
Top down on the Cadillac Allante'
I get street stripes like Carlito Brigante
Dog, I tax yall cause it costs to live
And still show no love like foster kids
I rent out homes in the hood and live across the bridge
My car's hotter than Negril
While y'all walk, I wheel
Oh, your Roley go tick and tock? It's not real
And keep a piece around my neck I know worth ya deal, nigga

[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome to you
All the way from the slums of Shaolin
Special uninvited guests
Came in through the back door
Ladies and gentlemen, it's them!

[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
Dance with the mantis, note the slim chances
Chant this anthem, swing like Pete Sampras
Taking it straight to Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, you got cash, pass it
It's drastic, gotta send half to Dirty Bastard

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Waves is spinning, blades is spinning
Slay em in the eighth inning
Stay truck, god stay playing linen
Kill rap, observe the uptowns, ho, feel that
Mink jeans on, seen where the real at
2000 Zitos, moving with a ill ego
For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 9 more civilians
Pollying deals, monopoly and bills, y'all niggas lying
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it
Words from the heavy set, if I don't eat, then we already met
Fly ass bro, liver than coke

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Now what Clan you know with lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through Hell
With 9 generals, 9 ninjas in your video
9 milli blow, semi-auto with no serial
Man metaphysical, I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck with digital
Never seen, smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a Jones, more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, taking all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in

[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
That's word to Damo, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach wit Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin' the nozzle, hear it whistle
One in the head, this is code red, man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped, rifles, banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip

[Verse 5: RZA]
Yo, you may catch me in a pair of Polo Skipperys, matching cap
Razor blades in my gums (BOBBY!)
You may catch me in yellow Havana Joe's goose jumper
And my phaser off stun (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin' chess, studyin' math
Signin 7 and a sun (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet, in the joint
Smoked out, dead broke or off point (BOBBY!)

[Verse 6: Ghostface Killah]
Wallo's comfortable, chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin' out, yours is talkin'
Rock so steadily, son, I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs from the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners, Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap, reimburse me
Rothsdale's, ruby red sales, Bloomingdale's, blocks
Ox tails chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice, maxed out, creepin' wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches, switchin with they backs out

[Verse 7: U-God]
Niggas wanna pop shit, I pop clips
Bitch, I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split, hammer slay quick
That David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth, jailhouse snitch
My powder voice, Snow White sniff
Verbal killas, gorilla grip
God body shit, puff Marley spliffs

[Verse 8: Cappadonna]
You might see me in a 6, that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch, that's not my child
I be in the benzo, keep a low profile
Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryin' to get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime

[Verse 9: GZA]
Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowin', without any knowin'
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay
It's on once I grab the baton from the DJ
A athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
Wireless nigga who sprint off the gun sound
The best time yet still 7.0
Swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow

I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin', I replace them, huh?
Drunk off Cris', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
""And I wish I never met her at all...""
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Cris'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere

Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra
Filth Mart jeans, take that off

Let's keep it real ma, you saving it for carats
You wanna see how far I'mma go
How, much I'mma spend but you already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Cris', but that about it
Might light your wrist, but that about it
Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love the Hov', and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound

Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's sold
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me, c'mon

Lyrics have no dress code (yeah)
From KRS to Depeche Mode
Kid I'm so cool you catch cold
At the jump off, it's about to jump off
My niggas speak with they hands or the gun talk
Yo RZA, we got the Clan in the front and police at the door
Every exit is laced with C-4 about to blow
Life trial I'm passed out
MC's is like bitches in thongs - they assed out
But me, the M-E-T-H- the O-D

Buzzworthy on your MTV, the Killa Bees
John Jacob, straight up, break up, schemes and plots
Ace up my sleeve, bake up pies in pots
So this is what it's come to (Huh?)
Lickin' shots at them kids that used to punk you (Huh?)
Repetitious rap shit, don't get no air play ya mouth whip
And niggas can't smoke wit' dry lips so chapped
Bite my shit, I'm like Kojack to get my flow back
In fo' flat, I track you down like a low jack

""It's time for this real nigga shit..""

[Freddie Foxxx]
When I was small I made pause tapes for ""Super Sperm""
Rappin in high school, drinkin forties, smokin sherm
Listen to Cold Crush and Grandmaster Caz spittin
Gettin somethin then, that niggas ain't now gettin; feel me
Remember everybody wanted to be ""Peace, God, Divine""
Real niggas kept their attributes, right through '99
Peace to the god Taheem, watching over me
White chariots and horses, get me over rough courses
While I silence those voices that doubted my ability
To rip, through these young ass niggas
When I walk into the Lyricist Lounge, lyricists lounge
Cause niggas know that Bumpy Knucks'll tear this mutha down
Cause the rawest most illest shit, make up my sound
That's why I stay gettin money, like them niggas uptown
I'm in your face - nigga whassup now
Fuck all that peacemakin bullshit
I heard you spit you like to pull shit
That's all bullshit, you keep your nine on some full shit
You say you bust it, that's BULLSHIT!
You know the illest MC that ever did it
The rawest nigga that ever chewed up rhymes and spit it
In the new millenium cities, watch what I do
I'm bout to save hip-hop like Ghost did the Wu

Chorus: Freddie Foxxx (repeat 2X)

For the DJ's, the rappers, the writers, the breakers
The movers, the shakers, the beat, the makers
What's stronger than hip-hop niggas they can't take us
If we deal with the real, and shut down the fakers

[Freddie Foxxx]
I'm proud to be a black man in my existence, so fuck the Klan
I ain't blinded by your jewels and your million dollar checks
I'm always ready for whatever's next
My road in life ain't easy cause I'm complex
You know the real, nigga turnin these fake hard niggas to grasshoppers
Cause the real becomes the realest, when I cock the manstoppers
I remember talkin to Big Poppa; he said ""Foxxx, you the illest,""
(uhh) I make the realest nigga feel it
Got a little mob of niggas I send to rob niggas
Take all that fly jewelry, and give it to my moms
I keep the industry up in arms like Zack La Roche
Cause they hate to see me comin, with this too black approach
Through the hardest time in hip-hop, I stayed afloat
So let me give the media some fly shit to quote
I'mma always be a nigga, lookin through your eyes
So nothin that you do to me should come as no surprise
I continue bein raw dog, puttin in work
I drown a bitch and get away, like my name was Captain Kirk
Motherfuckers wanna hear it raw, Bumpy make it hurt
Step on stage, rip the whole shit down and merc'

Chorus

[Freddie Foxxx]
What fucked you up is that I'm so nice and don't rehearse
On any record I'm the king of the third verse
It's +Strictly Business+, if it's +Personal+ I let you know
I hold your heart until the Lord tell me let you go
Don't need advice from no corny ass A&R that never filled a milk crate
With breakbeats, I keep it raw nigga straight street
To my comrades in L.A, L.A., L.A
I still got the bulletproof - Pelle, Pelle, Pelle
Keep the music underground as I reiterate twice
Tell niggas to they face, I thought you wasn't nice
Kick my ass? Nah, not likely; out mic me?
Not likely, stay on the sidelines like Spike Lee
Niggas know Bumpy like to flow all out
Microphone, gun in hands nigga, go all out
No exceptions to females I ride 'em giddyup
How bad I wanna fuck Brat, since she pushed them titties up
It's the underground sound that designs the street
Freddie Foxxx designed the rhyme, Premier designed the beat

Chorus

Well, here's a little something for my people in the house
I'm gonna tell you what my crew is all about
We like raw rhythm fusion, real rhyme producin'
Songs for the world's men, women and children
Armed and equipped with much confidence
And this is how we're gonna make our living
Some are known for bein' biters
Non-creative and wack rhyme-writers
Yo, they soup you up but can't rock the jam
Known to the world as a one-hit band
Easy come, easy go, yo you had your turn
Temporary niggas touchin' up your perm
You see a rapper is a kid that brags and acts big
A rhymer is a nigga that can handle his biz
Yo, A rapper is a kid that's tryin' to be the shit
An entertainer ain't tryin' cause he already is

[Hook] x2
Welcome to the wonderful world of entertainment
Where life imitate art and people get famous
Welcome to the world of showbiz arrangement
Where lights, camera, action is the language

We was rockin a jam the other night
J5 was on the mic so the people was hype
Yo, we like to rock the party with adrenalin and passion
The crowd started screamin ""Action Satisfaction""
Numark dropped the beat and the heat from the fire
We brought the energy and streetcar named desire

We was flippin, they was trippin, how we was old schoolin'
Needle to the groove, hands in the air movin'
And we said to the crowd ""This is the place to be
Whether you paid a fee or you got in free""

So when you step through the door, the music gets loud
Manuever through the crowd to get a better view now

[Hook]

To be an MC, you got to be so fresh
To have style and finesse way above the rest
With the strong delivery, vocal chemistry
Street poetry in tune with the beat
So if you think you got the skills come take a test
Microphone check if you truly are blessed
If you can flow like water and can comprehend
You need longevity in this game to win
Now if you want to be the best you got to move and motivate
Watch the money that you make in the industry stakes

Cause some of these people ain't got no class
And some of these folks'll make you beat they ass
If you can believe then you can achieve
Get the loot, live the dream, be on top of the scene
To keep the people in it, and accumulate fans
To be dope in the studio and slam at the jams, so

[Hook]

Welcome party people, while we got your attention
There's a few things we'd like to mention
The name is Jurassic, but they call us J5
We rock bonafide fly rhymes fortified
We got 2 DJs controlling the beat and
Vocal harmonies make it sound so sweet
We're the four horsemen, with words to caution
Expressed and flipped in an orderly fashion
With the rhymin', designin' the music on time and
The fellas saying ""ho"" and the ladies losin' they mind and
The breakin', the scratchin', this thing called rappin'
The cultivated music that keeps your hands clappin
The passion, reaction, the street satisfaction
Brothers using no tactics to make it happen
The rhythm, the spirit, you love it when you hear it
Nowadays when you're samplin' shit, you gotta clear it

[Hook]

Welcome to the wonderful world of entertainment
Where life imitate art and people get famous
Welcome to the world of showbiz arrangement

Ducks came through, we laid 'em out
While you fucks dissect spit from Cage's mouth
When I run a vagrant route, you spacin out
With no family to react when your brains is out
And when I click this out you know the drill (SCATTER!)
This mic is Sid; hip-hop is Nancy after I stab her
On stage, you wanna go on after?
Show you the Art of War and then finish the crowd with the 1st chapter
Come and walk through this little doorway
Enter the mind of Cage and a horse will shit you out on Broadway
The flies won't eat it then feed it to the wallets
Peddle Smut like anabolic beer meth hydraulic
Alex frolics; hangin upside down
Ordained til my rhyme ninja bleeds through my face of war paint
So if you see me with a little pop jingle
Shoot me in the back of the head and feed me to my starvin bredrin

[Cage]
Cage kennelyz, back to the state with the pennel
Put you in the mental, locked down with three channels
EC Network, the weather station, my favorites
Cut your back out, sell it to Avirex
Kissed this new bitch with AIDS and I caught a cold sore
Looking for ""Sex in the City"" and I shit on these four old whores
Kick mud off my boots to shake the story loose
Actin bigheaded when I smoke with Beetlejuice

[Eon]
Kids wanna fuck with the Peddlers, I can't wait
That's straight Diablo's widow, datin the jake
You spit some shit, I'll return the sentiment
And spit in your face, cause you're not in your element
Born to slay them fake mega monsters

[Intro: RZA]
1,2, 1,2, yo check this out, it's the jump off right now
I want everybody, to put your work down, put your guns down
And report to the pit, the gravel pit
Leave your problems at home, leave your children at home
We gon' take it back underground, I be Bobby Boulders
Wu-Tang Clan on yo' mind one time
It's the jump off, so just jump off my nigga

[Hook: Paulissa Moorman]
Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it

[Verse 1: Method Man (U-God)]
Ha, holocaust from the land of the lost
Behold the pale horse, off course (off course)
Follow me, Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since Starks and Clark Wallabees
African killer bees blackwatch
On your radio, blowin out yo' watts
From Park Hill, the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill
Let's peel, who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill
Elbow grease, and elbow room
Baby play me, baby fall down, go boom
Party people gather round, count down to apocalypse
(I'm the kid with the golden arms)
And I'm the motherfuckin hott nikks pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month
Now I'm chokin, smokin, hopin
I don't croakin, from overdosin
Hey, kid, walk straight, master your high
Wu and Meth got you open (open), let's ride
Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much
Kid wanna get up then kid get touched
Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck
I'm the one that called your bluff
When your boy tried to act tough
Remember what Ol' Dirty said: ""I'll fuck yo' ass up!""
Now listen

[Method Man over hook]
Back, back and forth and forth

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
E with the English, extinguish styles extremist
Bald head beamers run wild
It's the kid with the gold cup
Stepped out like what
What's poppin, and y'all niggas dobo
Blastin shae shae, chocolate shortae
Rich color mocks, rock those all day
1960 shit I'm Goldie
That's right motherfucker don't hold me
The world's greatest, Las Vegas, paid as rock
Skin painted on my face look ageless
Perfect combos, Ghost bang out condos
Jeff from Hamo, ex three bangos
Bancos, stank hoes in plain clothes
Change those, bang those, same old, same old

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Yeah y'all, straight up this the jump off right here
The gravel pit, word up represent, rock the boulders
All my rich gangsta style, killers, y'all know what time it is
Shorty do your thing, get up on that shit right now boo, do you
That's what I'm talkin 'bout

[Verse 4: U-God]
Yo, step to my groove, move like this
When we shoot the gift of course it's ruthless
Grab the mic with no excuses
In a sec, grab the Tecs and loot this
Executing, shaking all sets, and I'm breaking all hecks
I'm taking all bets, move all best, who want the dram' next
You all stank, we got the bigger bank
Bigger shank to fill your tank
Still the same kill you for real, while you crank
Slide, do or die, fry to bake
Admire the greats, on fire wit a heart of hate
Bitter shark, every part I take, heavy darts that quake
It's okay, all fakes, get caught by the dropkicks
You know the thrill, yes it's Park Hill
Yo we hit 'em with the hot grits
On the go, check the flow, saying Wu don't rock shit
Stop quick, hold the gossip, stop sweating my pockets
I hear the hot shit

[Hook 2: Paulissa Moorman]
Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
You don't have to move a mountain
Just give me enough strength to climb
Oh Lord ! Don't take away my stumbling vows
And lead me a round

[Outro speech]
Yakub, maker and creator of the devil. Swine merchant... your time is near at hand. Fuck with me and your time will be now. Your presence here effects the mind of my people like a fever. You, Yakub, are the bearer of nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine diseases, evil, corrupt, porkchop-eatin' brain!

You love to hear the story, again and again
About a rap dynasty that just won't end
The monument, still in your face
Niggas played out, Shan still in the place
Hip hop was set out in the dark
The Bridge was never Over, we left our mark
The jam is dedicated to you and your boys
I brought my Queensbridge thugs to +Kill That Noise+

[Havoc]
If you was an out-of-towner, had to know somebody wit strength
You know the drill, shit was real, fuck around, got killed
You know the Hill breed of thugs, death to those that squeal
Squeezin them slugs, one love to thugs that died in the field
So many names don't got time to spit em, but through my rhymes they livin
We the Bridge through tracks I'm givin
Never lose sight, 41st Side's my life
The 40th Side of life, dunn we keepin it tight

[Cormega]
Yo it ain't just the music
Hoop aspirations or ghetto illusions
It's the product, east side, and all the beautiful children
And unleashed dreams comin through each building
If you sleep, you better wake up as you see
Mega more mature, I'm on a record wit Nature
Mind on my paper, nine in my waist
There's no denyin the greatness
Queensbridge, never try to disgrace it

[Millennium Thug]
Aiyyo the Queensbridge associations breeds similarity
Bricked up, chipped off rocked out salaries
Pull out long guns, pop out casualities
It's like I gotta see a thug nigga ill as me
The Ill Will in me, I rep that willingly
Step back enemies, death tracks feelin me
Six blocks, losin my mind
Runnin from D's
These P's got me usin my nine, I pop off

[Nature]
Y'all know the place where stars is from
Every night it sparks off and the crowds'll run
We leave chicks strippin over strollers (Slippin Sova)
In Queens, you be the victim till you get to know us
Your hood's bogus, my hood be keepin it crunk
So much be jumpin off I ain't sleep in a month
Y'all can play the front line, I be deep in the cut
Drive through, you can't peep it enough
You in the Bridge nigga

[Capone]
You must pay homage to my projects
We thorough to the end
Only jail and death divide us
From rap to the crack suppliers
Out-of-towners get knocked off
We regualte blocks laws
I had the hood like Watts flooded wit cop force
QB to the cracks in the pavement
Mister Everything that ? pool for stacks in a basement
Niggas understand the drama we bring
The legacy, dynasty upholding the ring where QB is king, what!

[Tragedy]
Yo for you I take a fifth to the head till I url
Boomerang dunn, QB bust they gun
Keep them PC niggas on the run, one
Mahti specialist, 2-5 the nemesis
The last verse, ""T.O.N.Y."" remember this
Resurrect through the birth of my seed, crime genetic
You synthetic, your gangsta's cosmetic
I move niggas telekinetic, who wanna set it

[Prodigy]
Yo yo move...
Me and my dogs comin through
We the grain, go against us you feel pain
Get rained on, we beat niggas numb
These niggas is dumb, you can't resist my dunns
2001 we still thump, the fuck happened to ya'll?
We like that snowball, goin downhill
We get large, you get bullets lodged
In your jaw, your ribs, your arms
We party hard, at the bar
Buyin bottles of overpriced styles and Remy Mar'n
The Head Niggas In Charge
We number one, QB there's no competition
Infamous Records, Bars and Hooks listen
Littles, Noyd, and Mega
We independent, dunn we Infamous Mobbin
G.O.D., Nitty and Twin in
The Ill Will Bravehearts, L.E.S. millennium

[Nas]
Yo blow faces, fo-fo blazes, no one's safe
This music mogul rollin wit a hundred soldiers
Gangstas we postal
Oh you didn't, wanna know whose life Was Written
The life I'm livin
The ice the women
The kites that sendin to lifeless biddin
The streets to prison
I touch you then buck you
Heats be spittin
La-ser, AR fifteen doors come down
Jaws is broke, your whole crew is coffin bound
Your ho, your man, lieutenant, your boss get found
This dough I got, I spend it and toss around
New York it's time we flip it, where you from?
Ladies, it's time we flip it, where you from?
Now tell me who was the true thugs in videos first?
Who had the projects behind us, who bit it the worst?
We from the largest project, yo the biggest on earth

Check out the oil my Cadillac spills
Matter of fact, candy-paint Cadillacs kill
So check out the hoes my Cadillac fills
20-inch wide, 20-inches high
Ho, don't you like my 20-inch ride?
20-inch thighs make 20-inch eyes
Hoping for American 20-inch pies
Pretty-ass clothes, pretty-ass toes
Oh, how I love these pretty-ass hoes
Pretty-ass, high-class, anything goes
Catch 'em in the club throwing pretty-ass bows
Long john drawers, long john stalls
Any stank puss make my long john pause
Women on their cell making long john calls
And if they like to juggle, get long john's balls

[Hook]
All my players in the house that can buy the bar
And the ballin-ass niggas with the candy cars
If you a pimp and you know you don't love them hoes
When you get on the floor (nigga throw dem bows)
All my women in the house if you chasing cash
And you got some big titties with a matching ass
With your fly-ass boots or your open-toes
When you get on the floor (nigga throw dem 'bows)

Dirty South mind blowing Dirty South bread
Catfish fried up, Dirty South fed
Sleep in a cot'-picking Dirty South bed
Dirty South gurrls give me Dirty South head

Hand-me-down flip-flops, hand-me-down socks
Hand-me-down drug dealers hand me down rocks
Hand me down a 50-pack Swisher Sweets box
And goodfella rich niggas hand me down stocks

Mouth full of platinum, mouth full of gold
40-Glock cal' keep your mouth on hold
Lie through your teeth, you could find your mouth cold
And rip out your tongue cause of what your mouth told

Sweat for the lemonade, sweat for the tea
Sweat from the hot sauce, sweat from the D
And you can sweat from a burn in the 3rd degree
And if you sweat in your sleep, then you sweat from me

[Verse 3]
Hit by stars, hit by cars
Drunk off the liquor getting hit by bars
Keep your gurrl close cause she's a hit, by far
Hit by the Neptunes, hit by guitars
Afro picks, Afro-chicks
I let my ""Soul Glow"" from my Afro dick
Rabbit out the hat, pulling Afro tricks
Afro-Amerrican, Afro thick
Overall country, overall jeans
Overall Georgia, we overall clean
""Southern Hospitality"" or ""overall mean""
Overall triple, overall beams

Thugged-out blocks playing thugged-out games

She need to get a piece of the American pie
And take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable
And turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills; I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
Shit, you never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday
I ain't invited
Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

Me and your daughter got a special thing going on
You say it's puppy love, we say it's full-grown
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic
But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever, forever ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school
And graduation

I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologize a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry

""Look at the way he treats me,"" shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
And I knew you and your girl ain't speaking no more ‘cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talking 'bout? Jealousy, infidelity, envy
Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing
So who you placing the blame on?
You keep on singing the same song
Let bygones be bygones
You can go on and get the hell on, you and your momma

(Although I seem.. and appear..)
Remember how good things everything used to be?
(.. to the naked eye to be normal..)
It used to just be so good
It used to just be me and this girl;
(.. thoughts grow haunted inside my head)
Yeah, right.. rrright!
(.. then strike! Pull out my naked eye and with this..
My mask of sanity's about to slip!)

[Verse 1]
Sittin in my room with a razor blade
Thinkin all my days are played as much as my single needs to fade away
Shoot myself in the arm and start bleedin
Don't wanna go yet, stick a straw in my wound and taste my heart beatin
Fuckin bitch left me and I ain't even peaked yet
(Fuck all that noise playboy, this leak's wet)
Smoke a bundle to the face lace my brain and neurons
Carvin all my downfalls into my fuckin forearm
(Cage snap out of this, it's just a girl)
It's just the world, it's just a life, it's just a rusty Rambo knife
Wedged between my ribs scratchin my heart up tonight
I'm gonna pull this shit off in front of all my friends
Went swimmin under the Brooklyn Bridge tryna catch the bends
Didn't swim deep enough my head imploded ten percent
Floated to the surface, the paramedic's like - what's this dent?
(I want everbody to back up, he's still alive)

[Hook - repeat 2X]
I'm a suicidal failure, look my life's a failure
I can't make it in rap because my birth's an error
Do what I can to catch a quick death
But I'm meant to be here and that's the fuckin hell I live with

[Verse 2]
Took the phone off the hook, ate multi-colored pills
Washed it down with Absolut and started writin out my will
Give my dawg bootlegs PS2 and DC
To my girl who left me when she said, ""Pick me or PCP""
Since I love to smoke I thought it was a joke
Tried to hang myself and I fell free from the rope
Broke both my arms, my neck smashed my femur
Got up somehow and limped in front of a beamer
Cracked my rib cage, look what you did Cage, you're dying
But I'm not dead yet I'm still trying
Cut my wrist and walked past some crips bleedin red
In hopes that I get shot in the fuckin head

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I drank a bottle of Jack, sniffed three bottles of kitty
In the middle of the freeway walkin to the city
So much PCP I changed my name to watermouth
Pumpin Masta Ase I walked into a jewish +Slaughtahouse+
Throw myself on the hook, now that's the chorus
Got split from my neck to my dick, now that's what gore is
Hollow man look at all my dangling parts
Dropping to the gutter with a piece of you in my heart
Little piece of shit that I couldn't fling from my chest
Should of stayed alive long enough to kill the fag you're with
But right now, my skin is gettin stripped off
Each one of my limbs is ripped off covered in thick sauce
My head hits the conveyer, I'm not thick and a prayer is sick
I'm wacthin a movie at Loewe's alone and you suckin some guy's dick
Six seconds left when I die I'm gonna find her
On some Poltergeist shit while my face goes through the grinder

I love y'all broads, no disrespect to my dogs
But I love y'all broads, yea I love y'all broads
To the ladies havin babies without no drama
To my niggas with figgas say I love my baby momma
I bought them shoes, them tattoos, an even fixed yo breasts
I put you inside the flyest rides an even put a ""S"" on yo' chest

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
This is for the ones who wobbled it an be puttin they mouth on it
An they suck everything out of it then they catch it and swallow it
I'm Lil Weezy for sheezy, I'm off the heezy believe me
See me, I squeeze in between it, and then I leave it so greasy
When I come through in a Rolls Royce, leave them with no choice
But to hop up in it an just let me make they throat moist
Ruby red an vodka it just carry a nigga
Give me three minutes maybe four she be wantin to marry a nigga

[Chorus: Juvenile]
Give me a project bitch
Give me a hoodrat chick
One that don't give a fuck
An say she took that dick

Give me a project chick
Give me a hoodrat chick
One that don't give a fuck
An say she took that dick

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
My momma send me by my grandma, my grandma flipped out
An said we ain't gone have no evil in this house
So I rolled out scoped me an ounce sold out
But I fucked up when I started livin up in this hoes house
Nigga started fuckin one of the broads
Cause she was suckin a nigga dick so good keepin it hard
Lettin a nigga cum all over her chest and tongue
She was still-un, I spared her because her chil-drun
She was a hoe she gave me head behind a building
Ain't sellin records but her mouth could sell a million
If you wanna take it there we can break it off
Cause yall pussy ain't gotta nigga tweakin at all
I slang this dick summer winter spring an the fall
Ask me to lay it down I'm bringin it all
I'm tryin to hit ya from the back til ya holla, ""Good lord
This motherfuckin dick good and it always be hard""

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Baby]
Look - a nigga could catch me r'd up
Them white folks know the code so we g'd up
An my range rover 4 door be d'd up
Tattoos and new cars and these project cuts
Got this nigga bitch I know been wantin to fuck
I deal with sluts ladies an bitches don't give a fuck
Project bosses Weezy say ""Respect Us""
Bitch nigga find me in the 4 door Lexus
I got a bitch shoot dice an a bitch that ain't right
I got a bitch who will front ya work an take ya life
I got a credit card hoe, a scam type hoe, a fraud type hoe
Like to snort that dope, a dick suckin pro
A calico hoe, a real solid bitch out Chicago

I got a project bitch like to start some shit

Turn it out oh, oh my god oh!
Oh, oh, it's the hardcore b-boy shit!
Hard to the core motherfucker, no keyboard shit!

[Psycho Les]
Aiyyo the Nuts landed, so pack it up
Pass the mic to big Psych, the manufacturer
The architect, bringing you the art of wreck
You used to hate my click, now you want a part of it
We coming with more hits that funk like Parliament
Comparing me to another's going to lead to an argument
The heat we fry you with, straight from the armory
Guerilla army, we kill tracks in harmony
My Nut orchestra blowing fuses
Your amp can't hold this music, it's booming
I'm in my truck cruising, 97 tuned in
The latest news is the Nuts new album is ruling
Y'all vs. the Nuts, you have a big chance of losing
(There's no escaping this) Or confronting the union
So stop fooling yourself, and feel these Nuts
Cause (No one's ready to deal with us) What?

(No escaping this) (Repeat 3x)
""No one's ready to deal with us""

[Juju]
Don't be humble, it's better to pull
Belive you eligable, get left like a vegetable
Man it's crazy and there's no escape
It's turned into a police state
The average cat don't even know his fate
Walking round like he hurting something
And there's nothing that he got to say that's even worth discussing
Listen to me, it's better to be
Lying dead with honor, soldier, than to never be free
Young niggas out here losing they dads
In the battle of the son of the fags
Every other country burning the flag
Don't let history repeat itself
That's how the devil plan to keep his wealth and feed himself
I'm the New York power hitter
Hit the devil in the fucking shitter
Take his manhood and all his glitter
Got guns ready to bust
""No one's ready to deal with us""

(No escaping this) (Repeat 7x)
""No one's ready to deal with us""

""Can't get away, there's no escaping this!
Surrender now, come out with your hands in the air

[Greg Nice]
Oh, no! Turn it out oh!
Oh my God oh! Turn it out oh! (Repeat 4x)

Juju, rockin on rockin on
Psycho Les, rockin on, rockin on (Repeat 4x)

""Corona in the house"" ""Throw your hands up!"" (Repeat 4x)

Keep it gangsta for the cowards so I give 'em hell

Wrist glist now cause I make a gang of cash
Light glance, still street with the doo-rag
Slang, spit game, change speech, how they do that?
Watch they mouths drop, watch the crowds pop up and act out
Broads with the screw face, smash on and knock out
Ain't changed game don't run me, I run the game
If I gotta keep it gritty so be it, I'm supposed to change
Like simple, dizzy broads ain't fuckin with my mental
Natural born hustlin' bitch check what I've been through

Exec to my own shit, dawg I'm ownin dot coms

Need me in the game, I'm the thrill in your life

Little boys hang me on their wall, I grow 'em chest hair
Why you listenin to other shit? You go the best here
Come on try your luck shorty, I got the rest scared
Bet you anything you ain't ready and you get left there
Ain't known for frontin' vouch for my behavior
Same way they get down I get down for this paper
Sixteen lean from my pence so you can test her
Still need to know who I am then cop the record
Take it like a class on me and learn the lesson
Bottom line my world, my way any questions

Hardball is played, won't starve today
Song after song I write so I get paid

Now bitch swallow it up while I shove it down
Make em love me over again and over your name
Betcha they get over your style and over your fame
Why you lookin sad at me, I ain't to blame

[Verse 1]
Boys and girls wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night I was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About 5 or 6 strippers tryin to work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonni, she went to junior high with me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancin' for cash?
I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said

[Refrain]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life

[Verse 2]
Girl you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said every day I wake up hopin' to die
She said-nigga I know about pain cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I been through more shit that you can't even relate to

[Refrain]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life

Yo way hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, stop the breakin' yo
Stop the breakin'
You should you ain't gonna be going out
Like this men

[Bridge]
Hold up!
What would you do?
Get up on my feet and let go of every excuse
What would you do?
Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through
Come on, what would you do?
Get up on my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Girl, I know if my mother can do it, baby you can do it

[Refrain]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life
Come on

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life, uhm

Cuz I blazed your man, I'm in the wrong

[Hook]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Sir Luscious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlos
And El Dorados; I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print?
Teddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sipping a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U
We blew hay too, athletes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make 'cause

[Hook]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Canary yellow seven-nine Seville is on display
My nigga Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' dip my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the Honeycomb Hideout
I'mma show you how to wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snipples
YKK on your zipper, lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzerd
Or sober, six million ways to fold ya
Like Noah's, I get two's of youse and you get pretty 'D'
But I'll call yo' ass round eight-ish, I know you'll be there for me, girl

[Hook]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Those huge baby eyes, get to runnin' off at they mouth
And tellin' me everything that's on yo' nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, love who you ain't — you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for 'bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk in double time
The boy next door's a freak, ha-ha!

[Hook]
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Don't you think I'm so sexy; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean
I love when you stare at me; I'm dressed so fresh, so clean
So fresh and so clean, clean

[Outro: André 3000]
And we are...
The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
And my, my...
The sky is fallin', ain't no need to panic
But ooh ooh...
I got a stick and want yo' automatic
Ooh, ooh, ooh...
Compatible created in the attic
And we are...
The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
And my my...
The sky is fallin', ain't no need to panic
But ooh, ooh...
I got a stick and want yo' automatic
Ooh, ooh, ooh...

Welcome to the Mo-Mo
(all right, all right, all right, all right, all right!)
You come and take a ride wit me! Hey, hey!
And that's the way we roll bro!
That's the way we...
Th-That's the way we...
Th-That's the way we..
Hey, that's the way we roll bro!
Welcome to the Mo-Mo

[Verse One]
Whatever you need, best believe
It's starting with Alley
Whether you fiendin' for some greens
Or you starving for patties
And if you (Roll!) well let me tell you what that five gon' get you
As far as (Smoke!) oh my dogg, he gon' fire up wit' you
And if you drink, I'm gonna buy some liqour
I'll make that moonshine shit that'll dry up your liver
I spent the whole day, I'm seein' now how I can get ya
Ya still standin' well, damn I still fire up switches
That's how I do it in the (Mo-Mo Baby!) Oh I rarely change
So you know Alley Life gonna keep that Mary Jane man

[Chorus]
Five'll get you (Tripped up!)
Ten'll get you (Fixed up!)
Twenty'll get you (Lit up!)
Hey, that's the way we roll, bro!
Thirty'll get you (Touched up!)
Forty'll get you (Sucked up!)
Fifty'll get you (Stuck up!)
Uh oh, welcome to the Mo-Mo
Come and take a ride wit me (Let's Go!)
You not expectin to be live as me, but try something 'cause
Five'll get you (Tripped up!)
Ten'll get you (Fixed up!)
Twenty'll get you (Lit up!)
Hey, that's the way we roll, bro!

[Verse Two]
I want you to take it all off
Nothing dropped in your drink
I want you to do that (yeah girl), go to that
It's not what you think
But when it comes to gettin' nasty
Oh yeah, I'm paying for that
No disrespect I keep it business, I ain't straying from that
But let me tell you, I don't play with that
So when I meet a broad
I'm comin' out the gate with that (Yo, yo, how much?)
If you straight with that
Well dig this here, I'm gonna page you back
Come to your spot and probably blaze a bag
But if I paid you can save the naggin'
Unless you screamin' ""Alley Life""
While you praise the thrashin' (right, right)

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Everybody and they mamma tryin' to up and stop this
I done told ya'll before, man, I ain't got shit
Ain't no bling bling floatin' round in my watches
Since the casinos came, Narc-o's been on my block
I can't mess with no lick if I can't profit
Or have sex with some chick if she ain't topless
I'm a freak, baby, gotta see them things hoppin'
Show me your face girl, let me know the pain's throbbin'
If I paid though, man, get the same options
You can either get game or get bouncin' (bye!)

[Chorus]

That's the way we (hey!)
That's the way we (hey!)
That's the way we (hey!)
That's the way we roll bro!

That's the way we (hey!)
That's the way we (hey!)
That's the way we (hey!)
That's the way we roll bro!

You know my name, bitch
Uhh.. yeah.. hold up
The streets gave me heat, and the Eagle was the thing that they gave me
It's the rap guerilla that still clap.. fucka
Yeah, guess who's back?

(Verse 1)
Mack, bitch - I move blocks and pounds
I move out with small blocks from towns
Move out with small Glocks and pounds (uh-huh)
And I take everything to the table bag and rock it down
Fuck who watchin now; the neighbors, they in pocket now
Fuck you haters cop some pocket now
When it come to coke you can't outwit me, mine cheap
Bout to take over the city of Philly like John Street
Nigga ask all y'all fiends, they call me Chef Boyar-Beans
Beanie Crocker, cook coke proper
Right amount of flour siffin it up
Coke spots runnin by the hour shiftin it up
Graveyard shifts, move packs in bundles
Braveheart kids, use gats don't rumble
Gorilla niggas goin ape in this concrete jungle
Banana clips'll make them monkeys humble

(Chorus)
BEANIEEEEEEEE! Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIEEEEEEEE! Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIEEE, BEANIEEE - Sigel was the name that they gave me
BEANIEEEEEEEE! Yeah, but guess who back

(Verse 2)
It's Mack, bitch - uh-huh, back in the mix or the scuffle
I'm in the hood with them chips like Ruffles
Boxman, Frito Lay, for that free dough boxin
You will lay, nigga I'm not playin
Listen, whether I make cash or take cash
I'm in the hood eatin with my dog like when we break-fast
B's on the hood and the wheel and the brake pad
Sheeit when I skate past, bitches shake ass
I sit four-thirty deep in wheels
You bout, four-thirty cheap in wheels - small Benz
Look at your small rims, small wheel, small grill
Big Beans, sittin in Bentley my heart peels
Zero to sixty so quickly how you want it? You can have it
Drop top, stick shift, automatic
Back wheels still smokin
64 still rolling, 3 wheel motion, it's ferocious

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
Mack, aiyyo
On the low doe (shh!) the whole city is mine
I'm trying to flood the whole city with dimes (yeah)
I'm in the kitchen yeah, with that vision wear
Get them digits clear you can come and get them pigeons here
Niggas talk about the crack game slowed up, BULLSHIT
You switch to hustle when the rap game showed up (uh-huh)
While you wastin your time spittin the rhymes
I'm gettin mine spittin them rhymes, but still pitchin them dimes
And the spot still sick with da grime
Glock 26 nigga but I'm sicker than nine
I'm live with the pound, small silencer calmin the sound
Stick with the seven, strickly smith with the seven (shit)
When I drop back and cock back
And pop that, I'm poppin for keeps -
I'm not gettin stopped in the streets
Imagine that a nigga tryin to rock Mack
Only nigga did it was Jay and he did it when I signed the contract

(Chorus - 2X)

Aiyyo, 1-2
Yo yo

[Verse:]
I cool out on the west coast, lamp in the east
If your rappin for change, then I'd be dancin for peace
A pretty boy gangsta with his pants in a crease
Spike the Berrier, spike the campus police
Now I don't give a fuck if it's your aunt or your neice
Best man or ya priest, your fam's gettin deceased
Cuz I keep shit hot, like a flannel or fleece
And bringin dimes this way is sand to the beach
Relax to the sun, I get harrassed by the ton
Want to beat you for money son, I'll smack him for fun
I represent the east baby, that's where I'm from
I'll smoke you on the mic, and blacken your lungs
I keep my girls close like I'm packin a gun
By the foot of my bed, where my jacket is hung
A callabo, I don't see it happenin son
And a battle, I don't see you lastin through one

[Hook:]
I'm taggin rappers out, cuz they're way off base
And see 'em try and take the lead as I rock the place
Esoteric fell off? No that's not the case
I'm standin in the winners circle, while you lost the race

[Verse 2:]
I'm ready to wreck ya, sever ya sector
Speak of my hands, just let the 7L lecture
Don't put it past me, like your the firearm
And I'm the metal detector, I'm here to protect ya
My rhyme is the paint, and the beat is the texture
Interrior design, when I rhyme I affect ya
Say it's amazing, +Trail Blazin+ like Drexler
In my act, you play the bad wreckin extra
Sorry homeboy, didn't mean to upset ya
You wanna grab the mic, but your hand won't let ya
Cuz it knows that if you do, you'll go home on a stretcher
Call the ambulance on the cell to come get'cha
I do this type of shit right here, just for pleasure
Stress relief, wait 'til my next release
I'll be hittin every station like a press release
7L & Esoteric, hip-hop expertise

[Hook:]
I'm taggin rappers out, cuz they're way off base
I see 'em tryin to take a lead as I rock the place
Esoteric fell off? No that's not the case
I'm standin in the winners circle, while you lost the race

{scratching - ""They call me E.S. the Overlord of Fresh""}

[Verse 3:]
I smack the new jacks just to add to the stats
My massive attack leaves your anatomy flat
I'm not mad at you black, yo I'm gad that you rap
As a matter of fact, cats are? Wack
Now your askin for that, maybe a pat on the back
Yo I'll tell you your phat, and sound phat on that track
Then I'll show up, where ya have the factories at
Grab a batterin axe, you start to shatter ya gats
And that'll be that, make sure everythings workin
I get heads open like a, brain surgeon
When I came splurgin, veterans became virgins
First they wanna battle but now, they ain't certain
Rhyme like a tech nine, it's the God-offilis
Clappin on command like a studio, audience
You could take a dope sample, chop it up or loop it
But still can't freak it like Joe, some cats proved it

[Hook:] 2x
I'm taggin rappers out, cuz they're way off base
And see 'em try and take the lead as I rock the place

U know u ghetto

(Bishop)
U know u ghetto when you got rats and roaches
With the fan in the window, front door wide open
U know u ghetto when u say ""I ain't offended""
Change the channel with some pliers, got a hanger for a antenna
U know u ghetto eatin chicken everyday
With color weave in your hair and you trickin for a pay
Gold teeth in your mouth
Out talkin loud
And the car that you drive cost more than your house
U know u ghetto when your job is illegal
Live in the projects with furniture like rich people
U know u ghetto when you cook with lard
Only credit that you got is your food stamp card
U know u ghetto when you own section 8
Have dues everyday, but you pay your bills late
Understand this song, get your jam on
And yo grandma whip you with whatever she get her hands on

U know u ghetto pickin boogers and you flick 'em
And eat with your hands stead of washin 'em, you lick 'em
You dont know your daddy
And your hair nappy
People catch the Holy Ghost in church gettin happy
U know u ghetto call the crib your house
Be at funerals screamin, fightin, then fall out
U know u ghetto sellin clothes that you stole
And when you go out it's like a fashion show
U know u ghetto with a name like Shaniqua
Pookie, Red, and Peanut puttin codes in your beeper
When you hear stuff, helicopter, city bus
Siren, trains, shots, straight out of the ice cream truck

U know u ghetto only shop when there's a sale
Late everywhere you go with an excuse to tell
U know u ghetto when you ??? outside
Catch bronchitis, get full and sleep tight
U know u ghetto when y'all stealin cable
Cussin and DJin on underground radio
Sayin Yo' Mama jokes
Fightin on talk shows
Matress against the wall
Ain't no frame, it's on the floor
U know u ghetto with dreads, plaits, and braids
Weave, colorful nails, afros, wraps, and Waves
U ghetto, won't pay back money that you borrow
And wearin an outfit you gon' return tomorrow
U know u ghetto bettin on a number
Usin words like ""Uhh-huh"", ""Naw"", and ""Uhh-uhh""
Stead of ""Mom"" you say ""Ma"", stead of ""Dad"" you say ""Da""
You see nickel stores, bar-b-cue stands, and laundromats

U know u ghetto punchin ain't playin house right
Your kids bare foot playin outside
Eat food of the ground, say ""God, bless the church""
Let your kids drink beer talkin bout ""It gives 'em worms""
U know u ghetto borrowin your friends clothes
Ran out of water supplies from people next door
U know u ghetto heat the house with the oven
And anybody famous from the hood your cousin
U know u ghetto cussin out your teacer
And when somethin happen your mama screamin ""Lord Jesus!""
When you use street knowledge
Graduate from school and go to jail instead of college
U know u ghetto bar-b-cuein every holiday
Pizza man won't even deliver around your way
Whjere the gang hang out, cornerstore hang out

Makin it happen, wit snappin to avoid that - anchor

[Hook: Eminem]
I've been so many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'?
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple hills

[Verse 1: Eminem]
(Yo, yo, yo)
Cool calm, just like my mom
With a couple of lawsuits inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
(oooooh) To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and (five I hit)
(Aww shit) I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick and lost the foster kids
This room makes me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'till I start losin' weight
'till I see dumb (shit) start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice trynna rap again!
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce!
I said come on bounce!
Everybody in the house doing mass amounts
To the women in the thongs with their asses out
We don't bull (shit) better ask around
D-12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizzare your mom is (passing out)
Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out!

[Verse 2: Kuniva and Kon Artis]
[Kuniva]
Junk that someone help Denaun
He's upstairs wrestling with Elton John!
[Kon Artist]
Hey Von, ya see me stepping on these leprechauns?

Yeah I took 'em all dawg with some Parmesan
And I think my arm is gone

Naw it's probably numb
Young, dumb and full of (cum)
(BLEEEEHH) And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue!
[Kon artist]
Scaredy ass it was a false alarm!
Ya think I 'bout to die when I just got on?
[Kuniva]
Yo, stop acting stupid
You so (high) that you might wake up with a (guy) on some new (shit)(EWWW)

Watch out, here it comes!

[Bridge]
Dirty dozen, 80 of us
Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probly' wanna take each other out and date each other
Somethin', Somethin', Somethin', Somethin', Somethin', Somethin', Somethin'
I don't know

[Verse 3: Proof]
Hop, hills, hills I hop
Hop two hills on stilts I walk
(Snort two lines) that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible I (killed) the hulk
I wanna (roll) away like a roller blade
Until my (eyes roll) back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and grey I'm 'a go for broke
No? Okey doke, (I'm packing my nose) with soap
*coughing* Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Aww, poor baby, born by (whore) lady
Now I'm paying child support? (It's your baby!)

[Verse 4 - Swifty]
I take (four shots) at one time!
And I don't need a chase when I'm swallowing mine
(Hey, ya got any room?) in Bizarre's hatch back
We can't go far cause the car has flats
Why the hell you people think I rap?
Cause my mother taught me how to breach contracts
And if you got cash, then hide it too (Swift chill!)
I'm just trynna get by like you!
Well I don't give a damn if you find me rude
Mean crude to hell with you too
I only need three (pills) and I'm cool
I just got some, and I'm going back soon

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Bizarre]
I'm at a rave looking at a babe like she want it
Gin and Tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Looney, crazy, jumpy, sexy, dopey headed guy
Whipped cream, dirty mattresses, wanna try?
(Blue pills, golden seals)
Got Bizarre acting ill
Drugs kill (Yeah right)
Chick I'm for real!
Shut your mouth you dirty girl
You know you want me in your world
Ladies, please don't fight
Bizarre's here all night!

Who am I? Petey Pab' motherfucker!
First to put it down for North Carolina
But guess what (what?), it's been worth it
I'm a superstar, bought me a big ol' car
Four point six (see the car!)
Black with the bars from the front to back
And got a button in the middle, make the trunk go ""eh-eh""
But it ain't 'bout that
It's about getting what you getting and driving all back here
Big fellas (six fellas)
Half of me and Carolina niggas done time together
Polk, Bladen, Marshall, Hoke, Greene County, Tillery, damn
Transfer, Sandy Ridge, Browns over here (greens over here)
Pasqoutank, down on the, Odom East (let me think)

[Verse 2]
You remember them days y'all, we used to play y'all
The radio and put our own lil' part in the song y'all
We used to (Rep our city, rep our city!)
Running through the school halls
Just before our basketball pep-rally jumped off
(hah!) My house, my home, my hood (hah!)
My brother, my sister, my cous' (hah!)
My niggas that was there from the beginning
Been wit me even 'fore they knew what bein' with me was
Y'all niggas just glanced at it, now I got y'all staring at it
But it's been the same ol' North Carolina it's been being
Y'all niggas just getting it, oh it's a shame isn't it?
Oh you thought we said we were coming wit a whole lotta something
We were bullshhh! (ahh!)

[Verse 3]
Man I had to do it
Just in case you were one of the ones
Who wanted to come and ask something stupid
(What you think you doin'?) What it look like?
Putting it down for my niggas in the south side
North Carolina, South Carolina
And all my little bitty overlooked hick towns
We gonna hit y'all asses, ain't nothing but a T. T. blast
What we got coming at you?
(Beats?) slamming, (verses?) classic
(Gold for this) What's after platinum?
(Baby you don't want the bomb)
And I don't meant to scare ya
But I'm about to bring it home
Blow these valleys, these hills, these streams
And N. C. outta the water
How's it feel to look a motherfucker dead in the grill
And tell 'em, ""I told ya!""

[Intro]
Funk, hit me up with some of that thug
Yup, just like that, hit 'em in the chest with it
One time, one time again in the head
For Buddy Roe y'all, check it out

[Refrain]
I don't know, what this world's gonna bring
But I know one thing, that this is the life for me
Baby cause I'm a thug
All day every day, baby cause I'm a thug
Wouldn't change for the world; uh uh, cause I'm a thug
That's right you heard, baby cause I'm a thug
Ah hah, oh yeah; check it out

[Verse 1]
Could it be my baggy jeans, or my gold teeth
That make me different from y'all
Ain't trippin' dog, but listen dog
I was raised a little different than y'all
I'm just doin' my thing, usin' my ghetto slang
And I'm representin' thug shit
Niggas who I roll with
Watch them niggas they're gon' love this
Niggas who - out on bond, on the run
And got ten years on parole
Since you can't say it dog, I'mma say it for y'all
Motherfuck the po-po's
Fuck the judge and C.O.'s, fuck the D.A. and P.O.'s
Fuck the family of the victim
Witness, and snitchin ass hoes - nigga

[Refrain]

[Verse 2]
See I'm so tight, niggas be like
That nigga got so many hoes
And I know he got clout, look at his mouth
That nigga got so many golds
Niggas be tellin' they hoes
There's some'n up with that nigga
Bitch I've been watchin' you watchin him
You must wanna fuck this nigga
My name alone, been known to break up happy homes
No disrespect dog
But you ain't have no business even answering her phone
Hello, who is this
If your ass was home, then
Me and her couldn'ta been gettin it on
And you couldn't have been hittin her right
Cause ever since that night she been hittin the phone
She want a thug

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Since y'all niggas wanna smoke the blunts, pump the guns
I'mma show you how to thug it dog, thug it dog
Give me half a pill, and some Zephyrhill
And I'm like fuck it dog, fuck it dog
Long as my ecstasy got the best of me, ec-stasy
Then none of you niggas ain't stressin' me
I got one request in this bitch
And you can have the rest of this shit, bitch
If a nigga drop some shit, it's wack as hell
And don't make no damn sense
Take it back, talk about it, and tell your dog
Don't even buy that shit
And I don't care who he is, or where he from
I represent thug shit
And you ain't gotta give me my props or nominate me
Cause dammit, I love this

Bring it! What? We right here
We're not going anywhere
We right here
This is ours and we don't share
We right here
Bring your crew, ‘cause we don't care
We right here, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
One mo' time, I gots to hit the streets off
Make the streets talk, let 'em know it ain't a sweet walk
This gon' be
The only joint made this year that'll knock 'til 2003
And y'all gon' see
That the hottest nigga out there was, is and will be me
Just like that, I can go away for a minute
Do some other shit, but bounce right back
And when it's on, I'm coming strapped
With some shit that'll spit from dusk 'til dawn
And when you gone, ain't no coming back in the morn
You think that shit was a dream, nigga? You gone!
That's for real; creep niggas like a SEAL
Toting steel, stick a nigga, make him squeal
""Oh, my God!"" Those can't be the last words of your man
Damn, your man was so hard; come on!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Here we go again; how many million did my last one sell?
Fuck it, I'm going for ten!
This never gon' stop, and every fuckin' time I hit you
It's going straight to the top of the charts
The champion, I'm a thoroughbred, my blood is strong
And I scratch 'til you done
Cross the line, and ain't no more scratches after that
Straight up, niggas is dyin'
Yo, what the fuck is you cats doing
Running around like this, like you won't get stuck?!
Yo, that's my word
I stay giving it to niggas, and I stay not really being heard
But, y'all gon' see
That the same things thou did to them, will be done to thee
And then you'll know, that sometimes though you come through the front, you leavin out the backdoor; come on!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bring the noise
And you better come with niggas you don't give a fuck about
‘Cause you gon' lose your boys
‘Cause we don't play, and the silencer will silence any cocksucker with somethin' to say
Dog for life, whether I'm on or off the leash, I bite
Streets are my life
Click click boom! {*gunshot*}
Another life taken too soon, another mother had a funeral
Still waters run deep
And the pain is forever alive inside, makes it hard to sleep
But I keep goin', goin'
Shit, I'm always careful when I walk, I'm always seein', knowin'
The dog gone live
Stay walkin the wire, over the fire, when I can I give
The dog is good, and how it's staying
Dog gon' fuck with the hood, the dog fuck with the wood

[Hook] 2x

[DMX]
We right here
Uh, uh, uh

[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
Let's put our hands together for this dynasty!
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
To the eighth wonder of the world!
The flow of the century, always timeless: HOV!
Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me, I appreciate that

[Verse 1]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't-born-hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof! —Vamoose, son of a bitch!

[Hook]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture, to let them know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Show them how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry is shady, it needs to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raising the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk mo' bucks

[Hook]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Verse 3]
Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack
Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' their mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen Hoop Dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail: the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game: the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets bu-sy

[Hook]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, get'cha damn hands up!

[Outro]
H to the Izz-o, V to the Izz-A
H to the Izz-o, V to the Izz-A
H to the Izz-o, V to the Izz-A
H to the Izz-o, V to the Izz-A

The projects, the drugs (uhh!), the children, the thugs
(uhh!) The tears, the hugs, the love, the slugs (c'mon!)
The funerals, the wakes, the churches, the coffins (uhh!)
The heartbroken mothers, it happens, too often (why?!)
The problems, the things, we use, to solve 'em (what?!)
Yonkers, the Bronx (uhh!), Brooklyn, Harlem (c'mon!)
The hurt, the pain, the dirt, the rain (uhh!)
The jerk, the fame, the work, the game (uhh!)
The friends, the foes, the Benz, the hoes (what?!)
The studios, the shows, comes, and it goes (c'mon!)
The jealousy, the envy, the phony, the friendly (uh-huh!)

[DMX]
What we seeing is!
The streets, the cops, the system, harrassment (uh-huh)
The options, get shot, go to jail, or getcha ass kicked

The release, the warning, ""Try not, to get in trouble"" (damn!)
The snitches, the odds (uhh), probation, parole (what?!)
The new charge, the bail, the warrant, the hole (damn!)
The cell, the bus, the ride, up North (uh-huh)

The fightin, the stabbin, the pullin, the grabbin (what?!)
The riot squad with the captain, nobody knows what happened
(what?!) The two years in a box, revenge, the plots (uhh!)
The twenty-three hours that's locked, the one hour that's not
(uhh!) The silence, the dark, the mind, so fragile (aight!)
The wish, that the streets, would have took you, when they had you
(damn) The days, the months, the years, dispair
One night on my knees, here it comes, the prayer

[Hook 2X]

[DMX]
This here is all about!
My wife, my kids (uh-huh), the life that I live (uh-huh)
Through the night, I was his (uh-huh), it was right, but I did
(uh-huh) My ups, and downs (uhh), my slips, my falls (uhh)
My trials and tribulations (uhh), my heart, my balls (uhh)
My mother, my father, I love 'em, I hate 'em (uhh!)
Wish God, I didn't have 'em, but I'm glad that he made 'em
(uhh!) The roaches, the rats, the strays, the cats (what, what?!)
The guns, knives and bats, everytime we scrap
The hustlin, the dealin, the robbin, the stealin (uhh!)

Got beatin's 'til the age, I carried a twelve gauge
(aight!) Somebody stop me (please!), somebody come and get me

[Intro]
Je t'adore, JAY Z
That means ""I love you""
Of course I love you... I love all y'all
For real

[Hook: Biz Markie]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
[Jay-Z]
Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya
Holla at you when I come off tour

[Verse 1]
I got this Spanish chica, she don't like me to roam
So she call me ""cabron"" plus ""maricon""
Said she likes to cook rice so she likes me home
I'm like, ""Un momento, mami, slow up your tempo""
I got this black chick, she don't know how to act
Always talking out her neck, making her fingers snap
She like: ""Listen, Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap
You better R-E-S-P-E-C-T me""
I got this French chick that love to French kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
""Ma cherie amour, tu es belle""
Merci, you're fine as fuck but you giving me hell
I got this Indian squaw, the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with: red dot or feather
She said: ""all you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough""
Now that's Spanish chick, French chick, Indian and black
That's fried chicken, curry chicken.. damn I'm getting fat
Arroz con pollo, French fries and crepe
An appetite for destruction but I scrape the plate
I love

[Hook: Q-Tip]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
[Jay-Z]
I come scoop you in that coupe, sitting on deuce zeros
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll

[Verse 2]
I got this young chick, she so immature
She like, why you don't buy me Reeboks no more
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
Got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla
Got a project chick that plays her part
And if it goes down, y'all, that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the NARCs, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma she's always on the scene
God damn she's fine but she parties all the time!
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo
That means I'm new-school, pop pills and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first class seat

[Hook: Slick Rick]
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore

[Verse 3]
I got this paranoid chick, she's scared to come to the house
A hypochondriac who says ouch before I whip it out
Got a chick from Peru that sniff Peru
She got a cousin at customs that gets shit through
Got this weed head chick, she always catch me doing shit
Crazy girl.. wanna leave me but she always forgets
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick
Cause she kept bootlegging my shit, man
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull
She like: ""Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?""
I'm like: ""excuse me Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass
You was dead broke and naked, and now you want half""
I got this ho that after 12 million sold
Mami's a narcoleptic, always sleeping on Hov
Got to tie the back of her head like Deuce Bigalow
I've got so many girls across the globe

[Outro]
[Biz] I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore

[Karachi Raw]
Fuck them other niggas, kickin bitch business

Every five minutes bitch; hit windpipes with this
So they can't come off, Raw bustin in they ears
Feel the killa dealer, get bigger, it's gets no realer
We never liftin nothin, work for light year figure
You don't love me - y'all seein cents and dollar signs
So we see y'all in the same motherfucker gimme mine
Equal with the numbers, we recruited this summer
I went, low on the hoe, that love to blow and trace numbers so
Take it easy, don't get hit up, hit up
Blow stama(?) that'll get you lit up, lit up
Pour liquor that'll kill ya liver, liver
Wiser killin got us gettin richer, and richer
Richer and richer, richer and richer
Killa - dealer - kill 'em; got to kill 'em off
No love without y'all, no peace without war
Battle yourself for all

[Chorus: Raw]

[Skar]
Straight out the Boogies for you crack-smackin rookies
Stackin like a bookie, rockin hoodies
Never was a goodie-goodie, so take this advice
Pay the price, pray to Christ, I'm worse than Poltergeist
It's not the bark it's the bite, my heart is trife
If y'all wanna brawl, I'm like six feet tall
Keep the piece in my drawers, the heat's raw
But ain't nuttin like C4, we ready for y'all
When the shanks get sawed ya legs and dogs
Caliente like hot sauce, slim but I'm not soft
I was taught, to hold four in fours
Bust off, if my dues a buck short
I harm for the cause, and my niggas up North...

[Chorus: Raw]

Roll out

[Hook]
I got my twin Glock forties, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin' on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that

Twin Glock forties, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin' on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that

[Verse 1]
Now, where'd you get that platinum chain, with them diamonds in it?
Where'd you get that mackin' Benz, with them windows tinted?
Who them girls, you be with, when you be ridin' through?
Man, I ain't got nothin' to prove, I paid my dues
Breakin' the rules, I shake fools, while I'm takin' a cruise
Tell me who's your weed man and how do you smoke so good?
You's a superstar, boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that bag, what you got in that bag?
A couple of cans, a whoop ass, you did a good ass job
Of just eyein' me, spyin' me

[Hook]
I got my twin Glock forties, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin' on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that

Twin Glock forties, cocked back

We rollin' on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that

[Verse 2]
Man, that car don't come out, until next year
Where in the fuck did you get it?
That's eighty thousand bucks gone
Where in the fuck did you spend it?
You must have eyes on your back
Cause you got money to the ceilin'
And the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
The better I'm feelin', the more that I'm chillin'
Winnin', drillin' and killin' the feelin'
Now, who's that bucket naked cook, fixin' three course meals?
Gettin' goosebumps with her body tapped in six inch heels
What in the world is in that room, what you got in that room?
A couple of gats, a couple of knives, a couple of rappers
A couple of wives, now it's time to choose

[Hook]
I got my twin Glock forties, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin' on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that

Twin Glock forties, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that
We rollin' on twenties, with the top back
So much money, you can't stop that

[Verse 3]
Are you custom made, custom paid, or you just custom fitted?
Play station two up in the ride, is that Lorenzo kitted?
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just your main bitch?
You take a pick, while I'm rubbin' the hips
Touchin' lips to the top of the dick and then whew
Now, tell me who's your housekeeper
And what you keep in your house?
What about diamonds and gold
Is that what you keep in your mouth?
What in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?
Get up out my face, you couldn't relate
Wait to take place at a similar pace, so shake, shake it

[Hook]
I got my twin Glock forties, cocked back
Me and my homies, so drop that

Get out my business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business
Cause these niggas all up in my shit
And it's my business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business
Cause it's mine, oh, mine

Stay the fuck up out my business
Cause these niggas all up in my shit
And it's my business, my business
Stay the fuck up out my business

Yo, this for my niggas, though, special delivery
Spit like this, get my wrists all glittery
Get cake, snakes get slithery
Lean in, show y'all the meaning of chivalry
Rap ruler, you could ask Buddha
Right jab like Zab Judah
Every member on my team is the shooter
Tight like a womb, no room for intruders
Spark Buddha, twistin' the Philly
And Good Humor, don't be silly
It's gravy baby, I got it all smothered
Like makeup, I got it all covered
Want a jewel, don't be cruel
It's authentic, don't be fooled
By these phony accusations
Backlash and slanders
Front, and they publicity stunts and propaganda
Keep it private, cause I'm the commander
In chief, I never stop like beef
Gimme a break, I might shake the building
Play safe, vacate all women and children
I spit it out

Special delivery
I want that
Special delivery
I need
Special delivery
Can I have that
Special delivery
Come give it to me

If you ain't ready, I'mma bust through ya curtain
Encore, you're not sure, I'm certain
Wait, make sure the mic workin'
Make cake, sorta like Earth Wind
And Fire, the rap vampire
Retire in the morn'
Warm like campfires
Matter of fact, I'm blazin'
Raisin' the roof up
Slide off with ya rooster
Took her to the stu and seduced her
Let her do a skit, then she hit my producer (Oh)
Not whatcha used to, I'm looser
Ya need to stop fuckin' with them losers, now who's up
The mystic ruler, grand imperial
Filthy, but milky like cereal
Bang this in ya stereo
MC's is dead and I'mma get head up at they burial
And that's disrespectful
I'm strong like Exo mixed with X, yo
And that's the high capability
And yes, I possess that ability
I spit it out

Chorus (repeat 2x)

[Verse 3]
Yeah, ayo, Dep so bright, light looking halogen
Spit that bar, car low mileagin'
Let's go, metropolitan
Area, cuz I'm hearin' ya hollerin'
The earthquaker, Harlem bread maker
Gimme two hands, few grams and the shaker
Hit the block, watch the kids bake up
Your girl keep coming around
Then I'mma take her to Jamaica
And I give her a reason to get curious
But ya pain, it ain't that serious
MC's ran with this and that
But change your name to Saran cause it's a Wrap
Your rap is like a sedative
You sleepy, defeat me, negative
So it's over and I guess you gotta live with it
And you can tell by the records that's distributed
I spit it out

[Produced by Megahertz]

[Intro - Sample]
Woke up this mornin'
You got yourself a gun
You got yourself a gun

[Hook]
Yo, I'm living in this time behind enemy lines
So, I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)

[Verse 1]
My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with ""God's Son"" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames a huddle, your teams shook, y'all feel
The wrath of a killer, ‘cause this is my football field
Throwing passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast ‘cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store. Many try, many die
Come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
And If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed, hair parted with a barber's preciseness, Bravehearted for life, it's
The return of the Golden Child, son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffin' that tropical, cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? Never! 'Member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me ""God's Son"" with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is Nasdaq though, in my Nascar
With this Nas flow, what could beat that? Not a soul reppin'
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's the return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris, get chips, wrist glist – I floss
Stick-shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live?
Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watching my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya

[Mystikal]
You keep bumping me against the wall
Yeah I know I let you slide before
But until you seen me...trust me

[Pharrell]
You ain't seen bouncin' back
(repeat)

[Mystikal]
I really be throwin' my words
Standing 'em up, and jammin' on the one
That ain't nobody but Neptunes bammin' on the drum
Swift flip kicks landing from the tongue
More dramatic than Batman and Robin, ba na na na na na
The one that be handling business, be sharper than a thumb tack
The one that be dropping these albums, showing 'em how to come back
And you gone respect me, appreciate where I run at
You ain't gone piss me off, cause you sorry that you done that
I gets meaner, badder, stronger and ferocious
You don't even much want to see the rest
I'm coming back mo' fearless, mo' determined to fold the set
I ain't even started yet
So if you ain't ready you better get ready
Know I do it better when I'm being opposed
Ah stick ya chest out, keep ya chin up
And sometimes you gotta get knocked down to get up

[Hook]

No matter what happened, that's only once, it's shame on you
You come up and here and do it again then its shame on me
Sometimes we be getting in trouble you didn't want learn
Sometimes we be getting so rude you ain't want see
I accept my wages like the way that I fail
I grow, I take strides and but 'em under my belt
I learned from you just like you learned from me
I plead, I pray for peace and perfect harmony
Somebody say fool you better keep on rapping

Stop that trippin', causin it ain't gone happen
I told them look you better mind yo business
Change yo' way of thinking and keep on living
Done started some trouble and you ain't been out since
Cause you stuck inside scared watching CNN
Just take the precaution so yo life a be better
Tell my friends to call me I ain't accepting no letters

[Hook]

Oh you heard about it, yeah you had to
Hmm-huh, I know you change ya mind you ain't the only one with bad news
I know that they made you feel strange huh
You was right in the middle complaining and forgot what you was cryin bout
It could be you time and it might be
You can't do nothing about it, its God will thats just how life be
One day it hit 'cha then its gone
And I'm serious and you ain't never even gone feel it until it hit home
That's when the pain run sharper and deeper
You ain't eat that's when the days feel slow and long
I know you miss 'em so it's time to uplift 'em
Try to pick the pieces up and find a way to drive on
I tell you the truth so don't lie to me
Get back Satan don't bother me
And that's the way its gotta be
And when its over and done with I hope you proud of me

[Intro: U-God]
Yo.. yeah
Don't erase none of that good shit in the beginnin
Yo.. spill drinks on ya, get stank on ya
Yo.. yo.. pinky ring shit, yo
That pinky ring shit, yo

[Verse 1: U-God]
It's that pinky ring shit, the legend of masked kid
Shoot out the speakers when my guns get jurassic
Superbad, who am I? Dolemite classic
The vandal's back, hands on Angela Bassett
I handle my plastic, gunplay I mastered
No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds
Lady's choice, the golden voice still peppered
Better, respect it, bitch believe
I pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves
I air out the showroom, the shit can breathe
Fix your weave, behold my expertise

[Hook: Wu-Tang Clan]
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Take it back to the peoples, leanin' gettin' rec room punch
We in them authentic alley switchin joints
Major general niggas, five stars
Both arms rock when coke dropped we read a hundred niggas palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin me now respect get your fingers off the glass

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Yo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin yo, big fat nigga bleedin
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought FUBU
Blew you, authentic doodoo, picture the fog iced out
18 karat rap between noodles

[Hook]

[Verse 4: RZA]
Up at Killa Bee headquarters, four whips just pulled up
I saw Johnny sippin Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, two-way vibratin off the hip
I sit took three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead king, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo! I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, "".. Any Means Necessary""

[Verse 5: Method Man]
John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all get shot

[Verse 6: Inspectah Deck]
New York, New York, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charlie Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crash-tests can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda, three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin, feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and move global on you locals

[Verse 7: Masta Killa]
This is grown man talkin, coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef for the rice and peas
Nuff respect father Eton with Addies
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see

[Verse 8: GZA]
From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets

Ay yo, my rolls be Liberace
And my bedroom is off the hook all day, designed by Versace
Y'all just watch me, this is how I blow up
Right when y'all finna leave the joint then I show up
Star-spangled up and my chain got cuts
Mr. T looked, saw my shit and went nuts
Starks stays in luck, truck
There's a new gangster in town and he's coming up
Staten Island's cap on hoes with most info
Crown Royal bottles in the back, blowin Indo
Fly shit like Curtis Mayfield and his intro
Throw this in your whip, convent, your tens blow
Yo' I kick the ill rhymes like this
Y'all niggas really never wrote rhymes like this
C'mon, stop frontin at a time like this
Pretty Tone in the house, you better hide your bitch

Big bellies to big tellies, Jim Kelly's, we flip cellies
It's Lils, dusted out heavy in the big Chevy
Kicked the ill rhyme, nah, nah, I said it before

My album is bulletproof, y'all can't kill me
In 2003 the lease is up
We on the block now, no need for y'all re'in up
Pop your seat up, chop the weed up, excuse me if I'm horny
No doubt, I might knock the beat up
Florence style, all up on the set freezed up

Lampin in the Hamptons, the weekends man

[Sample]
Same as it never was (x2)

[Verse 1: Masai Bey]
The ignorant idioms you've chosen sound spoken
Straight from the thoughts of a medium
Who protects his mind just to lose it
And reveals the demons that brooded
I'm talking matters of why you want to stop
No room on the planet for weathermen that are not
We got Cannibal Oxes for your snotty box
That means stamina, the vast program, aye yo
When I'm on the mic, the cover becomes a tan
And every verse is like a whole damn jam
This is simple, and yet it's hard as hell
Front, it'll be time to relocate yourself

[Verse 2: Camu Tao]
System in an ageing over years of light
He made it and sent off the decorated emits
Stay raw and wide range and migraines
And spit over the blue prints and diagrams
I have an extreme constructed titanium tinting around my right iris
With a shutter speed
That sees silence and spreads rooms
And program on the fields with flame matter
You can catch me running diagnostics on close range hits
And closed cases, and whats more
With a closed caption
I put a main squeeze on the Earths core
[?} brains of an on guard when they refuse to do
What the system do and move like the system moves
I can move this room we sittin' in with my two bare... minds
And crack the roof the feed these black holes some sunshine
I'm still sitting in for this shit again
?Would? back up and eat it, still stealin'
And still feedin'

[Hook]
(Same as it never was) (x8)

[Verse 3: El-P]
I felt the sickness and my food sat in your exact point of entrance into the circle of life and it's disturbing me
So if I react with a ?ass that he bounced? please pardon that I'm an insect and I'm sent for the radar bitch threats
And you can explain to your collectors how you got tossed off the set by an overweight rapper who chain smokes cigarettes
Who melted your nose bow with rock and ?more time? 'till it smells like balsamic vinaigrette, I'm not finished yet
If I could suffer through you, I'd leave this space a physical plane of puritan, or earn back my virginity
That seems a reasonable price to exchange simply for feathered wings or an afterlife of divinity
Sees it in the vic shit for bitch brain liquid
With a stain that hollows out nerve like a tooth beaver
And talks a ? to take the AIDS blood, two liters above you
Because you're not raw you're below sickness
I have you an amish clothing hiding your only witness
?'Till they're late and see if your dick rider powers are ride gimmicks?
We fell in love with your sad face a long time ago
Cause you grew up to be an asexual dynamo
This might seem simply put, but I outmeasure the apparatus with the tiniest fragment of pure manhood
Plus you forgot that you got your whole style from me
Just like a true Company Flow fan would

[Verse 4: Copywrite]
I'm my own worst enemy, me vs ten of me
I'll kill eight and make the two left clean the mess of me
These faggot labels pay me to hold back
So I won't outshine their artists on their own tracks
And mixing us? please, that's like mixing beetle juice with Medusa and Pugsley
This situations real fucking ugly
And you ran through the entrance brave, before checkin' if there was an exit to this parametric maze
I enter Hell’s doors, waltz through dispensing pain
Then exit flawless while you barely entertain
The next are flawless, while you barely entertained
A legend since my parent's sperm and egg met
I got psychics quoting shit that I ain’t even said yet
You can't have a top five when there's not me in it
When this drops you'll cop it
Then you're copying it
Y'all eat [?] when El brings a beat that's heated
Cause I kill it, resurrect it then repeat if needed

[Hook]
(Same as it never was) (x4)

[Verse 5: Vast Aire]
I'm an element in disperse, gone with the wind
Make them gusty... And when the knight wants the king's wife
You can't even trust me
It ain't like I got eggos over my head and wings to protect me
Tackle the mic type radio angry
Caught the QB with his hand up, he can’t stand up
They had the cannibal trapped up north (shackles)
And the only way out meant one face off
So I hid the pen in my hand and broke it apart, and use the contents inside to start the break out
Left one cat in the elevator, seizure had him faked out
Lambs are so quiet now as societies fallen
I got one life to live and raps the callin'
And park my rhyme bars from the stars and record 'em
And outline the constellation, the sky's margin
Close the book, sky dims, limits us often

Choked out with my brother playaz
Choke, choke, pass it around - pound for pound
Round and round, where'd it get down
H-Town, lay it down, tote big thangs round
One time for the underground
Trees for days, freaks to play, M-I-A
Lay back and switch the days
Still piss on the chick, while the girl kiss on the stick
Southern Hospitality clique, that's real boy
Slow down, ya need ta chill boy, down south we get ill boy

What's up, Fresh it's our turn baby

[Refrain]
Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp, eh eh, eh eh, I stay sharp
Can't pay my rent cause all my money's spent
But that's okay, cause I'm still fly
Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E class
But that's alright, cause I'm gon' ride
Got everything in my momma's name
But I'm hood rich, la-di-da

[Birdman]
Get your c-uh-c-uh-car, playa gems gon' shine
And tell momma get a mink, baby girl let's ride
You a number one stunna and we gon' glide
And go straight to the mall and tear down the inside
Prada, Gucci, full-mink leather
Burberry's cool, Coogi sweater
Twenty inches, pop my feather
The Birdman daddy, I fly in any weather
Alligator seats with the head in the inside
Swine on the dash, G-wagon is so fly
#1: don't tangle and twist it
When it come to these cars I am that nigga
The g-uh-g-uh-Gucci with the matching interior
Three-wheel ride with the tire in the middle
It's Fresh and Stunna, and we like brothers
We shine like paint, daddy: it's our summer

[Hook]

[Mannie Fresh]
Have you ever seen crocodile seats in the truck
Turn around, sit it down and let 'em bite your butt
See the steering wheel is Fendi, dashboard Armani
With your baby momma, player's where you can find me
Cruisin' through the parking lot on twenty-fours
Cadillac Escalade with the chromed-out nose
With an navigation arrow headed straight to your spot (Turn left)
Where your wife really love me cause the sex is so hot
Put the Caddy up, start the 3-wheel Benz (skurrrrr)
Hyper white lights, ultra-violet lens
Suma-tuma tires and they gotta be run flat
TV where the horn go, boy can you top that
I'mma show you some shit, rookie: press that button
The trunk went ""uh-uh"", and all of a sudden
Four 15's - didn't see no wires
And then I heard (boom) from the amplifiers

[Hook]

[Birdman]
Let me slide in the Benz with the fished out fins
Impala loud pipes, drinkin' the Henn'
It's the Birdie-Birdie Man, I'll do it again
In a Cadillac truck twenty-fours with tens

[Mannie Fresh]
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
Six bad broads flying in at nine
New Suburban truck with the porno showin'
Up and down and up they go

[Baby]
Bodies on the Roadster - Lexus, you know what
That hard-top Beamer, yo Ma, that's your truck
I'm comin' up, the hood been lovely
New shoes on the whip and I wake up to bubbly

[Mannie Fresh]
430 Lex with the convertible top
And the rims keeps spinning every time I stop
Got a Superman Benz that I scored from Shaq
With a old school Caddy with a diamond in the back

(Ms. Jade) Ladies and gentlemen
(Ms. Jade) Lay ladies and gentlemen
(Ms. Jade) *skrip skirt skrip* Lay lay
(Ms. Jade) La la la lay
*Earr err err*

[Verse 1]
Ms. Jade's the name comin to ruin the game
Bringin the thunder and rain, bustin a train or a plane
Me and my girls shrivel all over the world
Makin you stumble and hurl, braids ponytails and the curls
I got them folk pumpin and movin around
Jumpin and gettin it down, sweatin and workin it now
No question, gonna throw on them clothes tonight
So set them bows tonight, engines gon' hum on the bikes
No matter is he black, peurto rican or white
Stiletto, Timbs, and them Nike's, free chicken wings and some rice
I got your dude lickin my toes and stuff
What wha wha wha what, light the chronic up!
I know y'all gonna love when I do it
I do it professional like Duro and Clue
Doin it all for the loot
Y'all better get them asses up out the seats
Sweat runnin down your cheeks, virgins turn into freaks

[Chorus] x2

(Ms. Jade:) Ms. Jaaaaaaade
(Timbaland:) *Frickida frick fa frick* feel the girl she'll
(Ms. Jade:) Ms. Jaaaaaaade

Light the chronic up!

[Verse 2]
Ya bet was lost, time to set it off
Shoppin at the mall, don't care what it cost
Concerned about who be in my sheets
You got beef with me? Then don't speak to me
Like how my flow different kinda pace
Garbage and the waste, ""please get out my face""
You wanna taste? Miss me like I'm Mase
You wanna taste? Like me William H
I'm leavin y'all toothless like Gerome
Rollin on the chromes, two ways and the phones
This Philly chick ain't wit this silly shit
Blunts and dutches licked, scrapin up for rent
Rat smugg-el-in, like the government
Keep 'em bub-bel-in, take it on the chin
So now they all duckin from the slugs
Kisses and the hugs, just cut up the rug!

[Chorus] x2

[Verse 3]
I ain't gon' stop, 'til I'm satisfied
Chain hangin like Nas, see right through the lies
Y'all never knew a dame could be so tight--
Killin and feelin it right, gettin it on tonight
We keep it real, type of chicks we are
Gettin nice at the bar, bang it loud in your car
I'm from the town, niggas gon' hold me down
Lost but now I'm found, watch me snatch the crown
I clear my throat, ladies spit what I wrote
Takin off my coat, stuntin tryin to poke
We in the back, countin and peelin the stacks
Combin and brushin the tracks--y'all can't hold me back
I'm comin out switchin and changin your route
Takin it to the house, bills and large amounts
I got the club bouncin and shakin they frames
Masculine puff and then pass, if your feelin in Philly then dance

[Chorus] x4

(Timbaland:)
*Frid fra frick fra* feel the girl
*Frid fra freaky freaky* feel the girl
*Freh freh freh* feel *fee* feel the girl
*Shh doha doha digga doha doha fra fricky fricky* feel the girl

[Produced by Chucky Thompson and Nas]

[Verse 1]
All I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writing names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricocheting between the spots that I'm hiding in
Blacking out as I shoot back, fuck getting hit
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
Till everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon
Sent from the star, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience
Leaving victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die, with 9's out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now

[Hook]
All I need is one mic
All I need is one mic
All I need is one mic
All I need is one mic

[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer – tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me; fuck all of them
Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holding 17
27 hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime
Hope your funeral never gets shot up
Bullets tear through the innocent
Nothing is fair, niggas roll up, shooting from wheelchairs
My heart is racing, tasting revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MAC's, too many 9's
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semi's
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothing in our way
They bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flying, feel it, I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
‘Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself
They don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talking all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is
Niggas'll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is – I have none
Too late to grab guns, I'm blastin'
‘Cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifing each other up in prison yards
Drama – where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop would get killed
Body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range
Niggas throwing dirt on my name
Jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me ‘cause they thought I was finished
Should've knew she wasn't true
She came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blinding, I never make the same mistakes
Moving with a change of pace
Lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swelling my melon, ‘cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were telling police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searching, the time is now

[Verse 1]
One two
You're behind the walls of new Rome, you wanna buy the farm (you wanna kill yourself)
But the land's not yours to own (but your life's not yours to take)
Who owns Police? Who holds fold green, sold sand to beach?
Blood beach
Dance with the land sharks clutchin' heat, ugly
Monks hung halo teach
Hung by the math where the cable reach
A hundred and sixty-six channels lit
The train that animal shit
Where the mind's eye redefines
Where's God?
Buy car, Kick tires

Back in Eighty-Six I lived
For the four-course artistry
Metal worms took turns showin' off colors and shit
Like I invaded a mating dance ritual
Criminal now
Why the things we find beautiful undermine power?
El Product flash vet text
Motherfuckers is like ""Al, why haven't we lept yet?""
Dithering sine wave twang for youth and brain management truth
Then vanish like ""poof""
You can't touch the Krush Groove
I live on the lunch table
Touched fables
Ducked labels
Cafeter one heat em live for the terrordome stables
Sign to Rawkus?
I'd rather be mouth fucked by Nazis unconscious
Callin' all bomb threats
The Radio re-activator, caress
Under hellafied missle defense
Fenced in, better blame it on fame's shitty grin
Walk with a bag full of kittens
Take me to the river and throw yourself in
In about four seconds the ether will begin to leak

Who wanna hold hands with this sicko malnutritionist
Soaked in newspeak?
Dissolve into the syncopated fragments of vinyl
Splashed on loose leaf
We can embrace on the business end of my face first
Joe vs. the Volcano suicide leap
Dance with the vinyl monster
Devil in a blue sky flyin' with clean conscience
Save the gesture
You can't save the children, we weren't worth the effort
I'm a Caveman
Your modern ways frighten and confuse me
I watch your spirit box with the blinking lights and think
Are those little people trapped in that box? (No, Caveman)
But I do know converted mic digital 8-bus Mackie Avalon compression
Combined with 8-step perfected
Dirty words paralyze crumbs and infect shit
Infectious
Insofar as the ineffectual beg for the lectures
Development arrested
Trapped in the Cuckoo's nest
Looking for the nexus
If it's wild like that child fire 'em
Infrared scope in the clutch of a tyrant
New World lullaby, Sirens
Stuck migrants, lust and blind violence
It's all bad timing
Getting murked on a Tram over Roosevelt Island
You think that's spacey?
Deep Space 9 millimeter, son, keep smiling

Existence on the fringes and such

My generation just sit like ducks

See the rubble glisten that what I trust

Tell the historians I'm right here holding my nuts
Right here holdin' my nuts
Right here holdin' my nuts
Right here holdin' my nuts

Existence on the fringes and such

My generation make friends with slugs

Thank god for the drugs and drums

Tell history that I'll be right here hiding from guns
Right here hidin' from guns
Right here hidin' from guns

For the love of god, run

The world, is about to feel something (I'm yo pusha)
That they've never felt before
C'mon

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
From ghetto to ghetto, to backyard to yard
I sell it whipped un-whipped, it’s soft or hard
I'm the neighborhood pusha
Call me Subwoofer, cause I pump base like that, Jack
On or off the track, I'm heavy cous
Ball 'til you fall, cause you could duck to the Feddy Govs
Sorry my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes
Benz convoys with the wagon on the side
Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side
Man, I make a buck, why scram
I'm trying to show y'all who the fuck I am
The jewels is flirting, be damned if I'm hurting

Platinum on the block with consistent hits

Patty cake, patty cake, I'm the baker's man
I bake them cakes as fast as I can
And you can tell by how my bread stack up
Then disguise it as rap so the feds back up
Watch it, like my whip, like my chick, topless
Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit
Grindin' cousin, I got wholes for a dozen
Even eleven-5, if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name
So much dough, I can't swear I won't change
Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself
Cocky, something that I just can't help
'Specially when them 20's is spinning like windmills
And the ice 32 below minus the wind chill
Filthy, the word that best defines me
I'm just grinding man, y'all never mind me

[Verse 3: Malice]
My grind's 'bout family, never been about fame
From days I wasn't able, there was always 'caine
Four and a half will get you in the game
Anything less is just a goddamn shame
Guess the weight, my watch got blue chips in the face
Glock with two tips, whoever gets in the way
Not to mention the hideaway that rests by the lake
Consider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake
I'm grindin'

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
I move 'caine like a cripple
Balance weight through the hood, kids call me Mr. Sniffles
Other hand on my nickel
Plated whistle, one eye closed I'll hit you
As if I was Slick Rick my aim is still an issue
Lose your soul in, whichever palm I'm holdin'
One'll leave you frozen, the other, noddin' and dozin'
I'm grindin' Jack

Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game cause baby I can't talk it
Warm, sweatin, it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tanktop, on at this point
You with a winner so baby you can't lose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun
So take it off like your home alone
You know dance in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checkin your reflection and tellin your best friend
Like ""Girl I think my butt gettin big!""

[Hook]
It's gettin hot in herre (so hot), so take off all your clothes
I am - gettin so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
It's gettin hot in herre (so hot), so take off all your clothes
I am - gettin so hot, I wanna take my clothes off

[Verse 3: Nelly]
Stop pacin, time wastin
I gotta a friend with a pole in the basement (what?)
I'm just kidding like Jason (oh)
Unless you gon' do it
Extra, extra - eh, spread the news (check it)
Nelly took a trip from the Lou' to the Neptunes
Came back with somethin thicker than fittin in Sasoons
Say she got a thing about cuttin in restrooms - ohhhhh!

[Verse 1: Slug]
The first time I met the devil was at a Motel 6
She left hell to spend a weekend on Earth just for kicks
Sexy little bitch, shorter than expected
About 5 foot 5, big and thick in the breast and thighs
Beautiful, dark eyes, a strong stare
Large lips, soft hands and long hair
I said I'll make you smile for the simple fact I'm good at it
I'll make you smile just so I can sit and look at it

[Hook]
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle
I will show you all you need to know
You must hold on to anyone that wants you
And I will love you through simple and the struggle
But girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle

[Verse 2: Slug]
Who cares what Jane says? She always spits the same spit
I'd rather kill the radio and listen to the rain hit
Little sister needs seclusion some how she'll discover it through the pop music
Got used to the feeling of falling, but she'll never see her following
Bouncing back and forth between the healing and the hollering
Riding the outer ring of your own private saturn
Thoughts scattered all across the grey matter
Little baby doll she doesn't know what to say to ya'll
The patience is short and of course the pride is way to tall
Break it all smash the past like it was made of glass
Ain't no other way to make it last
It hurts to watch Lucy lucid dream
I've had the pleasure of seeing our hero kick and scream
And when she calms down I'll turn the sound down
And put my arms around the little lost and found and I'll tell her that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Slug]
Hush little lady don't say a word
Or the rest of the village gonna know you're disturbed
And if you let them know that you're vulnerable
Then there ain't no stopping how far they open you slow (yo yo yo)
I'm a chapter in your textbook read me like a checkbook
Mistook love at first sight for a sex look
Enough of the blind man's bluff
I want the good stuff
Trying to hook up a full belly and a foot rub
The modern man's hustle I dig it, I shuffle
Feed me your troubles and need me to cuddle (come on)
Bundle up in my mitten and coat
As cold as it gets I keep your winter afloat
So let the snow fall (it's coming down)
She doesn't want to understand why I still come around
She looks at the mirror, she don't see what I see
She holds no history of how precious she be
Lay your head on my chest, speak of the stress
Kick your feet up and rest, before we clean up the nest
I hate to see you upset, it cramps the position
And if you didn't know you better listen (you better listen cause)

[Intro: Obie Trice]
Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks – (*record scratch*)

[Refrain 1: Eminem]
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants ta
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (heyyy!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!

[Hook: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!!!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass {​​smack}​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

[Hook: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking ""this shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me!
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No, I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
(Heyyy!) There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

[Hook: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

[Fish Scales]
My first song was like forty-eight bars with no hook
You hear me flippin thru my pages out my favorite notebook
The microphone was in the closet (What?) No headphones, we lost it
Niggas scared to get some water, roaches hangin over the faucets
No AC, Tez'll break a sweat just tryin to make beats
E-Dubz was being a hustler, (Heeeyy man!)
Always flirtin with all his customers, and flat broke
Nappy smokin blacks out on the back po'ch
I'm thinkin I got everything a country boy could ask for

[Big V]
Now what we do to get here? (Say dat boy!!)
Lay it down and bring it to ya raw (Say dat boy!!)
Hey now we hurt some, suffered for more, takes what we work for
Hated for for the cussin, but the hatred it made us cuss more
Held on, but it was hard - stepped up, took charge
Ran through what we scared of, but what was we afraid for?
Look at what we made of, hard times done made us
Being here is alright, but MUST believe we want more!

Them country boys on the rise!
With them big fat wheels on the side!
Peep them vertical grills on the ride!
And aw-awww-awww-awwwww!

My yegga, we hogwild, bet that from that roota to that toota-file
Hell naw, them country boys ain't headed south for six miles
Kentucky mud, them kinfolk, twankies with them hundred-spokes
Skullied on that front po'ch, plus you know they got 'dro
Seventy-nine coupe DeVille vertical Caddy grill
Interstate 65 headin down to Cashville
Glass filled, to the tippy-top, back-seat Benz
Spent my last cent on the rent, left with pocket lints
A damn shame, gotta grind anythang and everythang
Jimmy Crack Corn, cross the county line with Mary Jane
A long time, a gravel road, to cash and fame and sold my soul
To Hell and back, and back and forth, with same jeans and nappy 'fro

[R Prophit]
I might, hop off the Harley, smoke mine like Bob Marley
Block parties with shawties, wallin like they swallowin Bacardi
Them butter-skin, Prophit gutter like kin

[Intro: Bobby Glenn + Jay Z]
Picture all the possibilities
Picture all the possibilities
Sounds like a love song
Sounds like a love song
The most incredible, baby
I can't see 'em coming down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We should've been together having Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view ‘cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town
Somewhere locking a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside a nigga so sick

[Hook: Jay Z]
I can't see 'em coming down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see 'em coming down my eyes
So I got to let the song cry
I can't see it coming down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see it coming down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
On repeat, the CD of Big's ""Me and My Bitch""
Watching Bonnie and Clyde, pretending to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand saying, ""Let me see that clip.""
Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see – that's it
It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy
And then they got fuzzy
And they don't remember that, and I don't remember you

[Hook: Jay Z]
I can't see it coming down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see it coming down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
Yeah, I've seen 'em coming down your eyes
But I got to make the song cry
I can't see it coming down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without getting at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga living was whack
But you don't get a nigga back like that!
Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
I was just fucking them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I'll mourn forever, shit
I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever

[Hook: Jay Z]
I can't see 'em coming down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry
I can't see 'em coming down my eyes
So I got to let the song cry
I know, I've seen 'em coming down your eyes
But I got to make the song cry
I can't see 'em coming down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

Ay, let me slide in the Benz with the fished-out fins
Hit the mall wit my girlfriends, dish out ends
Cause you know it ain't trickin if you got it
Copped baby girl what she desired
It's chump change ma, marijuana scholar
Know'n what I got up in my styrofoam cup - that purple stuff
It was given to me at birth to stun
So that's why I cop the Bentley with the leather and the furry cups

Hey, hold on mami them whips on dubs
Cadillac Truck, 28's, no rubs
Slide in the Benz, fins, bubble-eyed lens
Car show in New York, y'all know who wins
It's the Birdman daddy, with the Gucci Prada
Slant back Cup Truck, no rims - can't holla
It's that Louie Fendi on Ostrich streets
It's the tailor-made daddy, mami do you love me?

[Hook: TQ]
Baby, I'm a stunna

Don't.. you.. know.. it's a way of life?
Mami, do you want it?
Cause I'm about to bring it
Oh baby, can't stop the stun, no, no

[Baby]
Pop one, pop two with the new Nike shoes
Royal blue jag on 'em 22's
Slippers, white to breate, 500 Degreez
In that Cadillac Truck on 'em 23's
I'm the boss of the game with the money and fame
All these, naked women that pop champagne
And these, marble floors stay high as Rick James
If you know my name then you know my game

[Lil Wayne]
It's Lil Whodi from the hot block with serious flow
Gotta get dough, cha'll won't feel me broke
But, y'all don't hear me though
Til I'm rolling down my window where my grill is show
And you know I probably pump it through the hood on them 24's
Word, rims poking out the side of the err
Glock, have ya ribs poking out the side of your shirt
I'm a 17 nigga and I ride through the turf

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
Hey, and my pinky glow cause my rings is so...

Everywhere we go we smell like ick yo
Birdman, my Paw so that make me go.. fly like an eagle, fasheezy

[Baby]
See they think cause I stay English turn

Tats in my face, my back and my arm

[Lil Wayne]
Tats in my face, my back and my arm

[Hook]

[Outro: Mannie Fresh]
Yo, there it is, ya lil' low life

Oh yeah, believe that

We rollin wit Cash Money
Oh, I forgot about peace - Peace!
I mean.. piece of pussy, piece of land, piece of property
Just a mind game
Piece of mind, ya know
Piece of something, motherfucker!

[Intro: Eminem & Dr. Dre] (beeping)
Marshall! Sounds like an SOS
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics Andre, you're fucking right!
To the Rapmobile – let's go!
(Marshall ... Marshall!)
Bitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!
Hurry hurry, step right up!
Introducing the star of our show... his name is
(Marshall!)
You wouldn't want to be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you
(Marshall!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is back
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come
I'm inches away from you, dear, fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so

[Hook: Eminem]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, ""Holy bat syllables!""
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham when I'm gone
Time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!

[Hook: Eminem]
Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MC's don't see me
Believe me; BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around round here
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a ""hell yeah""? (Hell yeah!)

[Hook: Eminem]
Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Outro: Eminem]
So there you have it folks (Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
Here to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away, until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time, friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening (Marshall!)
Oh! Heh

[Intro]
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans
Explodin', tempers flarin' from parents
Just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one
Give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're probably sick of me now
Ain't you, Momma? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
(One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought
I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
‘Cause I'da killed him
Shit, I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
(One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition; take a second to listen
'Fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position
Just try to envision, witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin', goin' through public housing systems
Victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up
It makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now
And it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick
He's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now
You should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her—she won't even be at your funeral!
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song
Keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?
You selfish bitch; I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died
And you said you wished it was me?
Well, guess what, I am dead—dead to you as can be!

[Hook]
I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
(One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
This is for my number one
True baby for I adore

[Verse 1]
This is hard to say
I wanna make sure I go about this in the right way
Cuz lately I been busy a lot
And I know you don't feel appreciated and what not
I used to tell you that you're hair looked fly
Kiss you slow and stare in your eyes
Now I talk real foul and slick
Every other sentence is, ""You make me sick""
Back in the days I was your number one pick
Now your heart's half-broken and that's hard to fix
I had to dig deep inside myself
Cuz I can't see you bouncin' with somebody else
It's a long journey back to the place we was
When I was too embarrassed to admit I was in love
And you was my good girl that wouldn't give it up
I can't let us self-destruct

[Hook: Marc Dorsey]
Baby smile today
Cuz I been imaginin' more ways
I'm gon' love you better
When your friends'll see you too
Just when you think there's nothin' else I can do
I'm gon' love you better

[Verse 2]
When I think about the things we did
And I think about you having my kids
And I think about us sharing a crib
Losin' all that, God forbid
You deserve flowers and candy, the simple things
In addition to the SL's, baguettes and rings
Instead I walk around like I'm a king
And having you ain't nothing but a thing
I even stopped tellin' you the lovin' was good
Too busy frontin' in the hood
Baby girl, hold me tight don't ever let go
I'mma do it real gentle baby, nice and slow
One more chance baby and don't say no
Cuz I got another side to show
Some say love is painful it helps you grow
Well it's time for the pain to go, ya'know

[Hook]

[Bridge x2] (Pharrell Williams)
Do you think I meant to hurt you? (No)
Do you think I meant to hurt you? (No)
So let's laugh together, cry together
God willin' we gon' die together

[Verse 3]
It's a brand new me, a brand new you
A brand new day, sky so blue
Hold my hand while I walk with you
Sit on my lap, lemme talk to you
No more games callin' you foul names
Actin' like females is all the same
I'm gon' love you better, my mentality changed
From this day forward I'll never be the same
I'mma rub your lower back, share my dreams
I love you, lemme show you what I mean
Give you the deepest love a girl ever seen
Watch you sleep, so peaceful and serene
A toast to the queen, you're back in my life
But this time I'mma do it right
Trust me, from the bottom of my heart
Nothin's gonna tear us apart, promise

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Top down, chrome spinning
You see the boss grinning
I'm loving these damn women
I let two get in
She tried to let the rest fit in
I'm like, ""naw love, that's forbidden""
I ain't for squishing, that's a problem to the wheel well
Trust I know them 20's real well
Now we coasting, me, two chicks, and toasting
I turn up the volume, watch the bass get them open
Soft spoken, with a wild side
I love them in the ride, they love it in the ride
We was moving bodies before we hit the party
Before the DJ started cutting
I was already fucking
Cinderella'd you girls; from nothing to something
Hit the parking lot and hear the club system thumping
Lose the face, you two's was great
But it's to the V.I.P. I got new moves to make

[Hook: Pharrell]
When the last time you heard it like this
Smoke something, drink something, get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl
Only if you know you live
From the club to the parking lot
How many chicks can you fit in that ride?
Put 'em up, homie

[Verse 2: Malice]
Hey, it's just a day in the life
Club nights, one of the reasons I love life
Chicks be in the back tipsy
We gets in for free, ayy they with me
Two stepping, you see each crew repping
Slipping on the floor, mirrors and walls is sweating
Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time a song on
I like that ma, you do something to me
Come this way and prove something to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose
I'm open, but naw, I don't lose focus
If the shit jump off, you know the thing that I'm toting
But I'm only here to party, y'all
Carry every weekend like it's Mardi Gras

[Hook]
[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
When they say ""last call"" it don't mean the night's over
That mean it's time for her to show ya
How quick she can hop out those Gucci loafers
Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the choka
S&M chick, asked Pusha to choke her
But I thought about how rich I am and said, ""no sir""
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What did it the whip appeal, or my baby face?

[Verse 4: Malice]
The night's still young and I'm already leaning
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-2's gleaming
The liquor in me and I don't need a reason
Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen
I pull up, let her get in, she know from the beginning
She added to the list of them chicks that I done been in
Her head spinning and my head spinning
Mine from juice and gin and hers from neck and chinning
I'm a winner, man

[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

[Verse 1]
Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad, but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo! This whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

[Hook]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 2]
His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, ‘cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dum, da-dum, dah-dah, dah-dah

[Hook]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five, and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family ‘cause, man, these goddamn
Food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed; plus, teeter-totter
Caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screaming on her
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot
Another day of monotony's gotten me to the point
I'm like a snail, I've got to formulate a plot
Or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot, feet: fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Hook]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

Hands on the ball and I won't drop (no)
Half-assed rhymes that you can't watch (no)
It ain't cause I want to it's cause I got-ta
Get it Crip while the gettin is good
Before the game is 10% skill and 90% Hollywood
I don't need that, I don't believe that
E'rybody gon' get hurt, if I do dirt
I flirt with the idea of quittin' the game
Nah!! I'mma evolve continue to change
It take brains, balls and backbones to get it on
And keep it on, we keepin it movin, to each his own
So I spit about it, whatever I feel about it
I'm just bein real about it; X get hot nigga forget about it
Speech don't faiiiiil me now
Dedicated to the enemies that freeze and hold me down

Above the rest, accept no less
Go ahead, check the game, be my guest
Somethin brand new and heavy to get off my chest
Win time after time 'til there ain't none left
Hardhat, punch the clock, back to work
I'm bigger, stronger, faster, built to hurt
Everybody and anybody who come to my party
Like they ready to get roudy and touch somebody
Who's that nigga y'all came to see? ""X!""
Often imitated, but cannot be, ""X!""
What's next, collect respect like paychecks
Straight to the bank with my bitch and have safe sex
What do you believe in? I believe in
Seizin the moment, livin and dyin to spit with a vengeance
Here for redemption - been around forever
Y'all cats were just too blind to listen

It ain't my fault.. we keep droppin hits
And you can't spit like this, so I'm takin yo' bitch
It ain't shit changed.. we gon' bang like this
And I'm drinkin this fifth, we still don't take no shit

[Xzibit]
I got a ""Sixth Sense,"" that tells me you ain't worth six cents
I'm sick with my sixth sense
Whattup Doc? I'm gettin down to business
Crooked as the cops to the Rampart district
Lose yourself in the music, move it or lose it
Abuse it, let's booze it, please don't confuse it with the
Next man, it's the X Man rollin
Stand firm, solid as the ground I'm holdin
Make mine +Golden+, permanent +State+ issue
Stacked with the wealth that you can't take witchu
Long range missile, if we got issues
I'mma squeeze this shit and nobody gon' miss you
I'mma keep swingin 'til the medics come get you
We busy, stay off my line, you can't get through
Peep the design from the mastermind

[Intro]
It's 50 AKA Ferrari F-50
Break it down
I got a lot of living to do before I die
And I ain't got time to waste
Let's make it

[Verse 1]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothing
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop fronting
You ain't a friend of mine, you ain't no kin of mine
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with a nine?
We do this all the time, right now we on the grind
So hurry up and cop and go, we selling nicks and dimes
Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm fucking with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine
If D's ran up in my crib you know who dropping dimes

You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothing
We say you a wanksta and you need to stop fronting
You go to the dealership, but you never cop nothing
You been hustling a long time and you ain't got nothing

[Verse 2]
Damn, homie
In high school you was the man, homie
The fuck happened to you?
I got the sickest vendetta when it come to the cheddar
If you play with my paper you gotta meet my Beretta
Now shorty think I'mma sweat her sipping on Amaretto
I might hit once then dead her, I know I can do better
She look good, but I know she after my cheddar
She trying to get in my pockets, homie and I ain't gon' let her
Be easy, start some bullshit, you get your whole crew wet
We in the club doing the same old two step
Guerrilla Unit, cuz, they say we bugged out
Cause we don't go nowhere without toast, we thugged out

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Me I'm no mobster, me I'm no gangsta
Me I'm no hitman, me I'm just me, me
Me I'm no wanksta, me I'm no actor
But it's me you see on your TV
Cause I hustle baby, this rap shit is so easy
I'm getting what you get for a brick to talk greasy
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
If you play me close for sure I'm gonna pop my heat
Niggas saying they going murk 50, how?
We riding 'round with guns the size of Lil Bow Wow
What you know about AK's and AR-15's
Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh?

Yellowcity, Benzino
Yellowman.. Young Heff
That's what they call me
Yellowcity That's where I'm from
Benzino My nigga
Young Heff - c'mon rock!

[Verse 1: Benzino]
Checking in the closet for my blue Velour suit
Piping all around it wit the matchin' Timb boots
Hop up in the wagon wit the 20 inch shoes on.. ohh
Riding down the street wit a twenty G stack
Shorty paging me saying ""Zino where you at?""
Look up in the mirror 5-0 up on my back it's - uh ohh
Pull up in the spot smoking in the parking lot
Everybody having fun niggas don't stop
Pray to God that I don't have to let the guns pop it's
Maybe all the girls wanna chill wit Benz and Heff
Pushing up the bottle 'til there's no more Henny left
Step it up to Louie now let's see what happens next

[Hook: Mario Winans]
We gon' throw the party (yeah) rock the party (rock)
Then drink Bakardi (c'mon) freak somebody (freak)
Then leave the party to the after party y'all.. ohh
What we gon' do?!
We gon' throw the party rock the party
Then drink Bacardi freak somebody
Then leave the party to the after party y'all.. ohh
What we gon' do?!

[Verse 2: Benzino]
Lookin' at the shorty with the Frankie B. Jeans
Thong hanging out, butterfly belly ring
Butter leather boots with the tassels, that's mean - oh
Got up on that ass when she came up in the door
Rock it to the beat then we took it to the floor
DJ in the club spinning record back and forth - oh
People going hard cause you know the mood is right
Everybody screaming like they at a Tyson fight
Young Heff in the back wit a dime looking tight, oh-my - ohhh
Hit the sour diesel mami bouncing on my lap
VIP crowded so I take it to the back
Up in the coat room where you find 'Zino at
(And Mario too, yo)
Now everybody just

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Benzino]
5 in the morning more drinks at the crib
Whachu waiting for, mami? Get your ass in!
Hop up in the coupe, girls riding wit my friend
(Y-y-y-y-yo, y'all follow us, follow us)
Rolling through the city wit the CD on blast
Pull up at the mansion had to dip up in the stash
Scene looking sexy shorty got a fat ass, oh-my-God
Step up in the place everybody getting wet
Sweating on the floor dancing like they having sex
Popping Champagne taking bottles to the neck
Looking at my Jacob it's about that time
Sun's coming up bout to close the blinds
This is how we do almost everyday
Now meet me upstairs with Courvoisier

[Hook]

[Bridge - Eddie from Yellowcity] (2x)
What is a party if it don't rock?
We just gon' proceed to make it hot
A Yellowcity party, no it don't stop
We gon' rock...

[Verse 1]
Now I'mma do this thing like it ain't done before
Never leave the game stranded, I had to give more
I'mma give you what you want, what you waitin' for?
Make the music that the people can't ignore
A lotta niggas is bitches, a lotta bitches be trippin'
A lotta them be wishin' that they was in my position
A lotta niggas be cowards and most chicks be chickens
Fuck 'bout the CLUCK! CLUCK! Eve ain't trippin'
Most dudes is okay (Half of the rest ain't)
Talkin' 'bout what they wanna do (Reality they can't)
Ask 'em what they life worth, watch 'em draw a blank
I really ain't got no interest if it don't involve the bank
Most of the time I'm nice to 'em (Half the time I'm not)
It ain't nothin' new though (Learned it from off the block)
People think I changed much 'cuz I'm livin' good
Now they get my voicemail, hear them callin' me rude?
Sometimes I feel bad (Most of the time I don't)
'Cuz if I don't protect my shit (Other niggas won't)
Some want me to neglect my shit (Take it for a joke?!)
But I'm stayin' on the grind (Never goin' back to broke)

[Hook]
Anything I want
I'mma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am
Just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction

[Verse 2]
Now I'mma do this thing like it ain't done before
Never leave the game stranded, I had to give more
I'mma give you what you want, what you waitin' for?
Make the music that the people can't ignore
See how we do this thing dog, here we go again
Dre and Bombshell, don't you love how it blend?
Radio stations, DJ's they spin
Told y'all determined to win
You tryina enter through the back door?
Ain't nothin' happenin', this whole shit is my shit bitch and I'm the captian
Can't beat me join me baby then get to clappin'
Bang it in ya whip to get ya neck snappin'
I know you hopin' that I rest so you can breathe
Stressed when we in the same places 'till I leave
Whisper to they friends what they wanna do to me
Wish they could erase me, take away the air I breathe
And I feed 'cuz that shit only give me hunger pains
Never let you muhfuckas put out my flame
Ready for whatever, was trained to maintain
And I always been a savage 'bout the fame
Separate the girls from the women and the winnin'
Always knew the thrill was worth it from the beginnin'
Baby what's the deal I'm hurtin' 'em how I'm livin'
I gotta conquer it all now the world's my wishin'

Anything I want
I'mma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated

Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it

Just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction

[Verse 3]
Ain't nothin' hotter than this heat y'all, it's like a magnet
I don't really mess wit too many 'cuz they be plastic
That's it enjoy it boy, it's like magic
Anything less than a banger will not have it
Still I Ruff Ryde but I got my team
And we ain't goin' nowhere 'till we lock the game
But in the mean time ball while we live the dream
And now I need to hear y'all sing

[Hook 2x]
Anything I want
I'mma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it

[Intro: 2Pac]
Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine
I cry at times, I once contemplated suicide
And would've tried, but when I held that 9
All I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace
And even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place
The players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: ""Home is where the heart is.""
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
‘Cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll? If you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream, ""Peace!""
While the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps
With Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown; tell the lady in the liquor store
That she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton & (2Pac)]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky (in thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky (thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise, in the sky (in thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

Bravehearts, Bravehearts, Bravehearts…

[Verse 1]
Now let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step with
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lot of hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well-dressed
With finesse in a white tee, looking for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive through the city, no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out
Newness, here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with, swing around like you stupid
King of the town? Yeah, I been that
You know I click-clack; where you and your mens at?
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back

[Hook]
They shooting! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Getting big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 2]
This ain't rapping, this is Street Hop
Now get up off your ass, like your seat's hot
My live niggas, lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music diffuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just-coming homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phony
Pull out my waist, the Eagle four-forty

[Hook]
They shooting! Aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Getting big money, playboy, your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?

[Verse 3]
I see niggas running, yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk asses
Like Pun said: you ain't even en mi clasa
Maybach Benz, back seat, TV plasma
Ladies looking for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is
Show me love, let me feel how the head is
Females who's the sexiest is always the nastiest

[Outro]
And I like a little sassiness
A lot of class; mami, reach in your bag, pass the fifth
I'm a leader at last, this a don you with
My 9's will spit, niggas lose consciousness

Biggest dogg of 'em all, and youse a flea'n
And since I got time to drop it for you I guess I must
And give it to you motherfuckers like Busta-Bust
I keep the heat on deck, but in God we trust
And can't none of y'all fuck with us
But you can run up on the G but that's not thinkin' wisely
These thrillers are ""Contagious"", just like Ron Isley
What the hell is goin on? Someone's sleepin in my home

I do it for the G's and I do it for the hustlers
Here to annihilate you mark-ass busters
Eff the police cause all they wanna do is cuff us
The world is fuckin' chilly as if his name was Usher
But I'm still ridin' them 'llacs, makin them G stacks
And got them cornrows to the back
I ain't really tryin to be picky
But if you give me somethin, it's got to be the sticky
Green by the ounces, low-lows bouncin
Sandy Fay and Annie Mae kissin on my couch and
Ooh to the ouch and, Moet fountain
That's how we get down at the Doggy Dogg House'n
This year we ain't fuck with thousands
We clean with millions that get fly as a falcon
Pull up to the Doggy Dogg palace
With a car fulla bitches cookin grits like Alice (ooh!)

Three 14 inch rims is running on the side

[Verse Three: Snoop Dogg]
Take two and pass it, it will not burn you
From the Long Beach Chronicles to the Wall Street Journal
They all know the G with the Cutlass Coupe
Ask Bill Gates, ""Yeah I know the homie Snoop""
Yeah, I'm straight loc'n, hangin wit my folk and
Follow Rakim cause ""I Ain't No Joke"" and
Cuz, I done seen so much (like what?)
Enough to have your feelings touched
When the gunshots ratta, all your boys scatter
Check up on your homies but they gave ya bad data
Make a nigga stop BREATHIN, have his soul relievin'
And now you niggas believe in
What I say cause what I say is so real
Homie you don't wanna see the steel!
You dont wanna catch a body, you came here to party
Now that's what you should do, now where's my baby boo? (ooh!)

Little shawty, we used to be on the phone all day
Talkin' to the sunshine shinin' on my bald head
Now today seem strange
No call on my celly, no name on my caller ID
Callin' you up and ya OGs sayin' you ain't home
What's really goin' on? I wanna know
So gimme a call and let's play no games
I'm playin', you want the plane
Don't point a finger over herre
I bought you a fur coat for your birthday
And this the things I get shorty?
Over there you starin' mad
That I went out with them other chicks
I told you they ain't shit!
They were just some buddies from high school that I went to
Where my old homies wanted me to kick it to 'em
But I called you up but you wasn't home
Baby girl when you get this message, gimme a call
I'll be waitin' at home

I'm so sick of being lonely

I wanna know how it feels to be loved, be loved
Sick of being lonely
Every night while my man goes out with his homies
I wanna know how it feels to be loved, be loved

Hmmm, but tonight seem different
Man, it's about this fishy (I'm so confused)
Cuz I ain't even get shhhh
My wife ain't hit me on my pager or cell
And when I CALL HER, I keep gettin' the damn voice mail
What's goin' on? Yeah I know I'm wrong
For goin' and comin' home at 'bout four in the mornin'
Hopin' ya ""Home Alone"" like Caulkin
But I picked the wrong time, and respect will be expected

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick of bein' lon-
AHH, don't finish yo statement
You alone call me, I'll be yo replacement
Put me in the game coach, you can let that lame go
Let me lick you on your neck and go down to yo ankles
Cuz ain't no mo' better, freakier feller
From the Field to creep wit', when ya guys are dummy
Honey you lookin' good, and mo' gooder than a late of neck bones
Tenderized and yummy, the Energizer bunny can't compete with me
Cuz I be goin' and goin', rowin'
With mo' motion than ya ocean from night to mornin'
Hit it huffin' and puffin', breath stankin' and yawnin'

They like me, I want them to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York the niggas'll tell you I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold

So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed

[Bridge]
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You the faggot ass nigga trying to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talking about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me
""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate then let them hate
And watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fucking be

[Hook]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into taking drugs
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love
So come give me a hug if you're into getting rubbed

[Outro]
Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither
We in the club all the time, so pop, pop off

(Mhmmm) *inhales*
You high, baby? (Yeah)
Yeah? (Talk to me!)
You want me to tell you something? (Uh huh)
I know what you wanna hear

[Refrain: Eminem & (Dina Rae)]
I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Ooh boy, you drive me crazy) Bitch, you make me hurl

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now; got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a mothafuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

[Pre-Hook: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

[Hook: Eminem]
‘Cause I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman
Your Superman, your Superman

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked; bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I be in
We'll see how much you be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

[Pre-Hook: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow

[Verse 3: Eminem]
First thing you say: (I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me)
Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
(Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
""Rot In Pieces,"" uh, that's great)
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

[Intro: Jay-Z]
You can't roll a blunt to this one
You gotta, you gotta well, ya gotta light a J
You gotta puff a J on this one {*inhales*}
You can't even drink Crist-OWL on this one
You gotta drink Crist-ALL
Buy some red wine, a little Gaja 9-7
This is for the grown and sexy, uhh

[Pharrell - over the end of Jay-Z's intro]
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
Ex-cuse me; what's your name?

[Jay-Z]
Yeah, can I get my grown man on for one second?
Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be hangin' with Jay-Z, Jay-Z
(Pharrell: So hot to trot.. la-dy!)
Excuse me miss, what's your name?
Can you come, hang with me?
Possibly, can I take you out, to-night

[Verse One]
You already know what it's hittin' for
Ma I got whatever outside and you know what I'm sittin' on
50/50 venture with them S Dots kickin' off
Armadale poppin' now, only bring a nigga more
Only thing missin' is a Missus
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers
Got one chef, one maid, all I need is a partner
To play spades with the cards up, ALL TRUST
Who else you gon' run with, the truth is us
Only dudes movin' units - Em, Pimp Juice and us
..it's the Roc in here!
Maybach outside, got rocks in ears
PJ's on the runway, Young got air
I don't land at an airport, I call it the clearport
Therefore, I don't wanna hear more
Back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla!

[Ph.W.] Sex-cuse me... damn!
[Ph.W.] You're so contagious, I can't take it
[Ph.W.] Have my baby, let's just make it
[Jay-Z] I got my Gaja 9-7 on right now

[Jay-Z] Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be rollin wit Jay-Z, Jay-Z
[Ph.W.] You're so foxy girl.. you're so hot to trot

[Verse Two]
Everybody's like, ""He's no item! Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!""
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in ""The Matrix""
But fuck it, let the Fishburne
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!

[Ph.W.] Sex-cuse me... damn!
[Jay-Z] You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one
[Ph.W.] You're so contagious, I can't take it
[Ph.W.] Have my baby, let's just make it
[Jay-Z] You might go, you mighta gotta go get you some Scooby Doo's
[Ph.W.] La-dy
[Jay-Z] Gotta throw on ya Scooby Doo's; those are shoes by the way
[Ph.W.] You're so contagious, I can't take it
[Jay-Z] Gotta throw on Scooby Doo's, hehehehe
[Ph.W.] Have my baby, let's just make it
[Ph.W.] Ex-cuse me; what's your name?
[Jay-Z] This for the grown and sexy, only for the grown and sexy
[Ph.W.] So hot to trot.. la-dy! What's your name?
[Jay-Z] Woo!
[Ph.W.] You're so foxy girl.. you're so hot to trot

[Verse Three]
Love let's go half on a son, I know my past ain't one
You can easily get past, but that chapter is done
...but I'm done readin' for now
Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now
But ma you got a f'real f'serious role
I'm 'bout to give you all the keys and security codes
'bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin
But, before I jump out the window, what's your name?

[Ph.W.] Sex-cuse me... damn!
[Ph.W.] You're so contagious, I can't take it

[Produced by Salaam Remi]

[Intro]
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be

[Hook: Nas + Kids!]
I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)

[Verse 1]
Be, B-Boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person
Got her strung on that
Heroin, cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now, looks ugly and old
No fun cause when she reaches for hugs, people hold their breath
Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'mma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow

[Hook]
I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)

[Verse 2]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

[Hook]
I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)

[Verse 3]
Be, be, 'fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Princess when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying ""She's my Queen""

[Hook]
I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)

[Hook]
I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)

[Outro]
Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music

Yeah (uh), yeah, yeah (uh) (Grrrr)
Yeah, don't get it twisted
This rap shit is mine, motherfucker!
It's not a fucking game
Fuck what you heard!
It’s what you hearin' (it’s what you hearin')
It’s what you hearin' (listen!)
It’s what you hearin' (listen!)
It’s what you hearin' (listen!)

[Verse 1]
X gon' give it to ya
Fuck waiting for you to get it on your own, X gon' deliver to ya
Knock knock, open up the door, it's real
With the non-stop, pop pop of stainless steel
Go hard, getting busy wit it
But I got such a good heart
That I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it
Damn right, and I'll do it again, cause I am right so I gots to win
Break bread with the enemy, but no matter how many cats I break bread with I'll break who you sendin' me
You motherfuckers never wanted nothing
But your life saved, bitch, and that's on a light day
I'm getting down, down like a nigga said ""Freeze!""
But won't be the one ending up on his knees
Bitch please, if the only thing you cats did
Was came out to play, stay out my way, motherfucker!

[Hook ]
First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go!
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya

[Hook ]
First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go!
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya

[Verse 2]
Ain't never gave nothing to me
But every time I turn around
Cats got they hands out wanting something from me
I ain't got it, so you can't get it
Let's leave it at that cause I ain't with it
Hit it with full strength
I'm a jail nigga, so I face the world like it's Earl in the bullpen
You against me, me against you
Whatever, whenever, nigga, fuck you gon' do?
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
Only nigga that you know that can chill
Come back and get the streets open
I've been doing this for 19 years
Niggas wanna fight me? Fight these tears
I put in work, and it's all for the kids
But these cats done forgot what work is
They don't know who we be
Looking, but they don't know who they see, nigga

[Hook]
First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go!
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya

[Verse 3]
Ay yo, where my niggas at?! I know I got them down in the game, give 'em love and they give it back
Talk too much for too long (What?!)
Don't give up, you're too strong (What?!)
Dub to the wild wild hunneds (Yeah!)
Shout out to niggas that done it (Come on!)
And it ain't even about the dough
It's about getting down for what you stand for, yo – for real!

[Hook]
First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go!
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya

Let her loose, let her loooooose

Yes I do, yes I doooooo-hoooo

Oooooooooooooooh, shit, that's how we do it baby
""Every day like this?"" Seven dayy-ayyys

[Hook] w/ minor variations

(I think I just..
Need to take this time and explain to 'em exactly..
What the pimp juice is)

[Hook]
Uh, hear me out now
Now your pimp juice is anything, attract the opposite sex
It could be money, fame, or straight intellect
It don't MATTER! Bitches got the pimp juice too
Come to think about it - dirty, they got mo' than we do
They got mo' - juice in they talk, got mo' juice in they walk
They got mo' - juice in they veins, OOH GOD DAMN!
I tell you man it's a cryin shame..

Pimp juice is color blind
You find it work on all color creeds and kinds
From ages 50 right down to 9
The Mayor of Nellyville and I won't resign, watch me recline
Cause you wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You really wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?

I just tackle the subject the flack of the public
Nothing, I know real niggas happen to love it
If you don’t like it then look in the mirror
Most likely you ain’t live it so you don’t get it
You ain’t did it so you can't vision it
The picture I’m painting ain't vivid
The language I’m spitting is so foreign to ya
See what starving'll do to ya
Growin up hard in a little apartment'll do to ya
I’m just talkin’ to ya

[Joe Budden]
Gimme that beat fool
It’s a full time jack move
Sorry Jay, Webb said take it back dude
Ha
Nitti too, he played a part in that
Listen I’m just having some fun
No

Part in the future
Sing the track now
It's been a good week Hova
You can give it back now
All these rappers is cooking crack and
Took the realness out the game it’s time to put it back in
The fans finally got it understood they just yappin
While Joey’s in the hood like Madden
Whoa
Success is wrapped up
Checks just rack up
Everybody’s a killer but the deaths don’t add up
Everybody’s a hustler but the money ain’t coming in
Y’all is it just my math sucks? Nah
In time I'ma super-succeed their wealth
Like everybody’s so scared to just be they self
Add the bass in your voice get found like the cool
So we could sound like loon or pound like boom
Don’t end up a dead man for the cheddar
Only way to play Joey's Def Jam Vendetta for real
On your Pro Tools lose, and don’t be shocked
Open the booth door we be like old school move it
I ain't Kobe or Tracy, Jay-Z, JB merk
Joey the future I’m more like Dirk
Anybody buyin respect me
Try and wet me
Y’all dudes will never make it
Y'all a Tyus Edney
I’m a standout like Yao Ming I’m what's sparkin now
Like fall back Shaq I’m startin now
Boys poppin it toys poppin spit
I’m not from round these parts I’m Stojakovic
Never hear your man say I’m the Jordan of rappin
He’s gettin fatigued early and his scoring is lackin
Legacy is gettin' ruined and you don’t want that
So pretty much learn from him, don’t come back
And rap is gettin’ wack, time for Gs to step in
Cause’ you are not that hot, don’t believe the yes men
Ain’t about who’s better than uh, it’s so evident
They hard to be real with no evidence
And I ain’t comin at Jay cause he’s the greatest breathing
But he already paved the way, I’m just layin my semen
Not the same way I was dude I’m done drivin' now
I’m in your 745 plus 2
Don’t have your label call mine for no extracurricular
Rappers is all girls who is extra particular
Seen many men with the jake
Next time you listen to many men I'll make sure you relate
Only Jay coulda came Just Blazed it like me
Everybody else chills, Just Blaze can agree
Packin a MAC in the back of the Acura no
Clappin' the gat you be wrapped in the caddy but naw
What you want punk double clip pump
Ride by slump forth cocked playa on top
Hater warm rock with his teeth toes wrapped
With the brand new savior of east coast rap
Don’t worry y'all  I’ll bring the east coast back
Nah par, this ain’t a movie but meet Joe Black
Try to relate to it I just speak those facts
If you was in the front now your seat goes back
What the deallin'
Like New York been soft since Bin Laden came thru and crushed the buildings
Trying to restore the feeling, just speaking to ya
I’m just speaking through ya

[Verse 1]
We sell crack to our own out the back of our homes
We smell the musk of the dusk in the crack of the dawn
We go through episodes too, like Attack of the Clones
Work 'til we break our back and you hear the crack of the bone
We're gonna get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by
We commute to computers
Spirits stay mute while you egos spread rumors
We're survivalists turned to consumers
Just to get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Ask Him why some people got to live in a trailer
Cuss like a sailor
I paint a picture with the pen like Norman Mailer
Mi abuela raised three daughters all by herself with no help
I think about her struggle and I find the strength in myself
These words, melt in my mouth
They hot, like the jail cell in the South
Before my nigga CORE bailed me out
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
We do or die like Bed-Stuy through the red sky
With the window of the red eye
Let the lead fly, some G. Rap shit, Living to Let Die

[Hook]
This morning, I woke up
Feeling brand new, I jumped up
Feeling my highs and my lows
In my soul and my goals
Just to stop smoking and stop drinking
I've been thinking, I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

Just to get by, Just to get by
Just to get by, Just to get by

Just to get by, Just to get by
Just to get by, by ,by

[Verse 2]
We keeping it gangster
Say ""fo shizzle"", ""fo sheezy"" and stayin' crunk
It's easy to pull a breezy, smoke trees and we stayin' drunk
Yo, I activism, attacking the system
The Blacks and Latins in prison
Numbers have risen, they're victims lacking the vision
Shit, and all they got is rapping to listen to
I let them know we missing you, the love is unconditional
Even when the condition is critical, when the livin' is miserable
Your position is pivotal, I ain't bullshittin' you
Now, why would I lie? Just to get by?
Just to get by, we get fly
The TV got us reaching for stars
Not the ones between Venus and Mars
The ones that be reading for parts
Some people get breast enhancements and penis enlargers
Saturday sinners, Sunday morning at the feet of the Father
They need something to rely on
We get high on all types of drug
When all you really need is love
To get by, just to get by, just to get by, just to get by
Our parents sing like John Lennon
Imagine all the people watch
We rock like Paul McCartney
From now until the last Beatle drop

[Hook]
This morning, I woke up
Feeling brand new, I jumped up
Feeling my highs and my lows
In my soul and my goals
Just to stop smoking and stop drinking
And I've been thinking, I've got my reasons
Just to get by, just to get by
Just to get by, just to get by

[Bridge]
Yoyoyo, yo, yo
Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay reading the signs

Some people cry, and some people try
Just to get by, for a piece of the pie
You love to eat and get high
We deceive when we lie, and we keepin' it fly
When the people decide to keep a disguise
Can't see they eyes, see the evil inside
But there's people you find
Strong or feeble in mind, I stay reading the signs

[Verse 1]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child
With dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out
‘Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, doo-rags and a stockin' cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

[Hook]
Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera; that was a fist that hit you

[Hook]
Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Sing this shit!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it?
How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry, at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment
Try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and hold it
‘Cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…

[Hook]
Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Verse 1]
Now, shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies
They pay her, ‘cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country
Think she like me ‘cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryin' to holla ‘cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryin' to holla ‘cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid!
Look, baby, this is simple, you can't see
You fuckin' with me, you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P

[Hook]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Verse 2]
I'm 'bout my money, you see, girl, you can holla at me
If you fuckin' with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch

[Hook]
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

[Verse 3]
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless; me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shoppin' for chinchillas in the summer, they cheaper
Man, this ho, you can have her
When I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
You sayin' it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch
She always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
‘Cause I need four TV's and AMG's for the six
Ho make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick

[Hook]
Yeah, in Hollywoood they say
""There's no b'ness like show b'ness.""
In the hood they say
""There's no b'ness like ho b'ness,"" you know?
They say I talk a little fast
But if you listen a little faster
I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, bitch

[Intro]
Hey dirty, look at that girl right thurr
She make me say:
Ooh, ooh, yeah ooh, ooh.. hey, what you wanna do?

[Hook]
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Swing your hips when you're walking, let down your hurr (let down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talking, that make me sturr

[Verse 1]
I like the way you look in them pants, see ya fine (fine)
Your momma a quarter piece, she far from a dime (dime)
The type of girl that'll getcha' up and go make you grind (grind)
I'm thinking about snatching her up, dirty, making her mine
Look at her hips, (what?) look at her legs, ain't she stacked? (stacked)
I sure wouldn't mind hitting that from the back (back)
I like it when I touch it cause she moan a lil bit
Jeans sagging so I can see her thong a lil bit
I know you grown a little bit, 20 years old, you legal
Don't trip off my people, just hop in the regal
I swooped on her like an eagle swooping down on its prey
I know you popular, but you gonna be famous today

[Hook]
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Swing your hips when you're walking
Let down your hurr(let down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)

I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talking, that make me sturr

[Verse 2]
She be shopping in Frontenac
Just look at her front and back
Man she so stacked and she know that I want that
Her man, he's so wack, girl can I taste yo cat
Gave her 300 to strip, like buying a throwback
She stay in the club, like to be seen, she got it honest
In real life, girl remind me of Pocahontas
She be at events, cuss out the press when she pass
All the high rolling cats wanna pay for that ass
Ain't no half stepping, she strapped with a nice weapon
Trick, it's against the law for her to move them hips
If you ever seen her dirty, your mouth gonna drop
Worldwide fools probably tell you this off tops

[Hook]
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Swing your hips when you're walking
Let down your hurr(let down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talking, that make me sturr
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Swing your hips when you're walking
Let down your hurr(let down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talking, that make me sturr

I like the way she doin' that (c'mon)
Plus I like it when she bring it back (say it)
Ooh, (uh-huh) ooh, ooh, ooh, (uh-huh) do what you do (whoo)
I like the way she doin' that (c'mon)
Plus I like it when she bring it back (say it)
Ooh, (uh-huh) ooh, ooh, ooh, (uh-huh) do what you do (whoo)

[Verse 3]
Gimme what you got for a pork chop
She threw it at me like I was a short-stop
Working in a Fatty Girl Hugga Top
Then she back it up on me and let it drop
Make it hop - boing - like a bunny
Girl can I touch you where it's sunny
Or a purse and make you give her some money
She should pose for Sports Illustrated
It's like a picture perfect site
When she pass all the other girls hate it
(But I...)

[Hook]
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Swing your hips when you're walking
Let down your hurr(let down your hurr)
I like the way you do that right thurr (right thurr)
Lick your lips when you're talking, that make me sturr

[Hook]
If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'mma let the champagne bottle pop
I'mma take it to the top
For sure I'mma make it hot, baby

[Verse 1]
I apply pressure to pussies that stunting I pop
Stand alone squeezing my pistol, I'm sure that I gotta
Now Peter Piper picked peppers and Run rocked rhymes
I'm 50 Cent, I write a little bit, but I pop 9's
Tell niggas get they money right, ‘cause I got mine
And I'm around, quit playing, nigga, you can't shine
You gon' be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After being hit by the pump – is that what you want?
Be easy, nigga, I'll lay your ass out
Believe me, nigga, that's what I'm about, gangsta
You could find a nigga sitting on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone

[Hook]
If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'mma let the champagne bottle pop
I'mma take it to the top
For sure I'mma make it hot, baby

[Verse 2]
I'm down for the action, he smart wit' his mouth so smack him
You holding a strap, he might come back, so clap him
React like a gangsta, die like a gangsta for actin'
‘Cause you'll get hit and homicide'll be asking what happened
Oh no, look who clapped 'em with the .44
20 inch rims sitting on Low-pro’s
Eastside, Westside, niggas know, yo, I’m loco
Even my mama said something really wrong with my brain
Niggas don't rob me, they know I'm down to die for my chain
G-Unit – we get it popping in the hood
G-Unit – motherfucker, what's good?
I'm waiting on niggas to act like they don't know how to act
I had a sip of too much Jack, I'll blow 'em off the map
With the MAC, thinking it's all rap, 'til that ass get clapped and Doc say, ""It's a wrap"" (It's a wrap, nigga!)

[Hook]
If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'mma let the champagne bottle pop
I'mma take it to the top
For sure I'mma make it hot, baby

[Verse 3]
I invented how to teach lessons to slow learners
Go 'head, act up, get smacked in the head with the burner
I don't fight fair, I'm dirty-dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga, ya heard me?
When streetlights come on niggas blast the 9's
Get locked up, they read books to pass the time
In the game there's ups and downs so I stay on the grind
Niggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
There ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine
This is God's plan, homie, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma who always gotta throw in her two cents
I'm the drop-out who made more money than these teachers
Roofless like the Coupe, but I come with more features
I am what I am, you could like it or love it
It feels good to blow 50 grand and think nothing of it, fuck it!

[Hook]
If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'mma let the champagne bottle pop
I'mma take it to the top
For sure I'mma make it hot, baby
If I can't do it, homie, it can't be done
Now I'mma let the champagne bottle pop
I'mma take it to the top
For sure I'mma make it hot, baby

With the pedal to the floor, radar in the GRILLE

More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat

Off the off ramp doin about a hundred and fifty
Rollin through East Point, on way to Ben Hill
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin and we startin SHIT

Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire cuz we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees and beez that's fantastic
So gulls hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
You'll be like lil John Q and get a Change of Heart

I'm ABOUT TO BLOW THIS WHOLE SHIT UP TO SMITHEREENS

Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come hang with me, basically
Hold up -- skip all the singing, let's get right tonight, mami

[Verse 1]
I know my English ain't as modest as you like
But come, get some, you little bums
I take the cake from under the baker's thumb
I bake the cake and two it up from one
Then I moved the weight like I'm Oprah, son
Uhh, I show you how to do this son
Young don't mess with chicks in Burberry patterns
Fake Manolo boots straight from Steve Madden
He patterns his-self, the rap JFK
You wanna pass for my Jaqueline Onassis, then
Hop ya ass out that S-Class
Lay back in the Maybach, roll the best grass, I ask
Have you in your long-legged life
Ever seen a watch surrounded by this much pink ice?
Look but don't touch, motherfucker, think twice
Cause this gat that I clutch gotta little red light
Need a light?

[Verse 2]
We got bottles full of Arme, mamis in Manolo
Bags by Chanel or Louis Vuitton logos
All attracted to Hov because they know dough
When they see him, whips be European
If you're a 10 chances you're with him
If you're a 5 you know you riding with them
Sick with the pen, nigga -- no physician in the world could fix him
No prescription you can prescribe to subside his affliction
He's not a sane man, he's more like Rain Man, twitching
You can't rain dance on his picnic
No Haitian voodoo, no headless chickens
Can dead his sickness, no Ouija board
You can't see me, dog; nigga, ya CB4
This ain't Chris Rock, bitch -- it's the Roc, bitch
And I'm the franchise like a Houston Rocket
Yao Ming?

[Hook 3]
Still smoking that la la la
Memph Bleek still smoking that la la la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle the .45
It's the Roc, baby; sing our lullaby
C'mon
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come hang with me, basically
Hold up -- skip all the singing, let's get right tonight, mami

[Verse 3]
Forget English, talk body language
I be all over mamis like body paint is
Pink diamond necklace, strawberry wrist
Please excuse yourself, you're very sick
Don't confuse me with Marbury out this bitch
Run up on me at the light, you could lose your life
Motherfuckers must be smoking they la la la with crack
Forty-five gun smoke, choke off that
Let's get back to the music, I ain't with all that
Plus the Feds tapping my music -- y'all get all that?
I'm the public industry #1
Public industry #2 is my whole crew (R.O.C.!)
Now I ain't down with who like me or who like you
That's gay, I ain't into liking dudes no way
But get a pen, I can tell you pricks my plans for the future
I never make the news again, my man'll shoot ya

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
What's wrong with the world, mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to the things that'll bring a trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips, and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love, this'll set us straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all

[Pre-Hook: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear 'em cryin'
Will you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong?
With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

[Pre-Hook: Justin Timberlake]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Will you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 3: Apl.de.ap]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm getting older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity
Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself…

[Bridge: will.i.am & Justin Timberlake]
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love?

[Outro]
Now sing with me, y'all (one world, one world)
We only got (one world, one world)
That's all we got (one world, one world)
And something's wrong with it
Something's wrong with it
Something's wrong with the w-w-world
We only got (one world, one world)
That's all we got (one world, one world)

What up, cuz?
What up, blood?
What up, gangsta?

[Verse 1]
They say I walk around like I got an S on my chest
Nah, that's a semi-auto, and a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothing, the DA might want to play in court
But I'll hunt a duck nigga down like it's a sport
Front on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you
You getting money, I can't get none with ya, then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for D.W.I
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit, them they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred G's I stash it, the Mac I blast it
D's come we dump the diesel in battery acid
This flow's been mastered, the ice I flash it
Jux me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard
I'm on the next level, Breitling baguette bezel
Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle, blood

We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit)
We don't play around

[Verse 2]
I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder
When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?
When the fifth kick, duck quick, it sounds like thunder
In December I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Every chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patti LaBelle, homie I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat is my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches
Industry hoes fuck us, in the hood they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chukkas

That's how all my niggas roll
Blowing dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll

[Verse 1]
I'm in a drop-top Chevy with the roof wide open
My partners looking at me to see if my eyes open
Cause I've been dranking and I've been smoking
Flying down 285 but I'm focused
454 SS, I race Porsches
White leather seats, as fresh as Air Forces
Doing 'bout a hundred but the track still bumping
Number 8 on N.W.A, ""Straight Outta Compton""
Pull up at your apartment sitting on 20 somethings
And the dope boys hollering ""What's happening?"" kid running in
The cliques start dancing and the broads start choosing
And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
Sign pictures, buy an onion of good and throw the deuces
Cause I ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood, I'm used to it
If your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating
24 inch Dayton's got the Chevrolet skatin' makin'

I make a million and I'm satisfied, I'll get the rest
Underaged civilian in the tigthest ride, I want the best
I refuse to get a 9 to 5, I'mma flip my keys
Been paying my dues since '89, tryna get my cheese
Diamonds gleam when I'm on the scene, they know it's me
Ain't no dream or no fantasy bitch, it's T-I-P
Broad busting, like a baby do a binky
Five karat DVS's on my mothafuckin' pinkie
Half of Hennessy and Belvedere's what we dranking
Pimp squad send for broads, what the hell you niggas thinking?
Young nigga spending weekends on the islands in the fall
24 inch rim shining when I'm riding cause I'm balling
I'm calling out shots like a pool shark
My tools spark in the dark when I fool marks
Y'all fools hearts in the wrong place at the wrong time, I got a strong mind
To grab my chrome nine and shoot at your ass for a long time
But I'mma get that ass hauled off, fuck around with the clique
They'll be looking for your dick with a stick, nigga y'all soft
So y'all lost, I'mma ball out at all costs, spit game to a dame
Make her ride on this thang 'til she falls off and sucks balls off, I got the

[Verse 3]
I'm not boucing little shorty, I'm relaxing right now
I'd probably still be trapping if I wasn't rapping right now
Bragging about pistols at the house, guess who's strapped right now
Keep on talking folk, I'll lay you on your back right now
Want to act right now, get smacked right now
I'm a buck mothafucka, I don't know how to back down
Clown down here fakin', frontin', talking ‘bout what you making: nothin’
I'm 21 and 10 years deep, that shit to me ain't nothing
I'm raised by the niggas getting head from the jays
Lose your leg when I spray, end up dead from the K
Stay ready for the raid, paid heavy from the yay'
I told my class to kiss my ass, I make 11 everyday

Only know how to be one way, that's the dog
I know how to get down, know how to bite
Bark very little, but I know how to fight
I know how to chase a cat up in the tree
Man, I give y'all niggas the b'iness for fucking with me, is you crazy?!

[Hook]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas acting up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you go'n pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas acting up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you go'n pull that

[Verse 2]
Once it's on, I come through, guns is drawn
Blam blam, lungs are gone, sons will mourn
From dusk till dawn, nighttime belongs to the dog
On the street passed midnight, look for 'em in the morgue
Don't play with these cats cuz I ain't got nothing to say to these cats
For the mothers that really do love em, please pray for these cats
Cuz I know niggas is hardheaded but I ain't got the patience
Don't want me havin no patience turn into more patients
More trips to ICU cause I see you
Tryna get away with shit a real nigga wouldn't do
Where my dogs at? (Right here) See them niggas? (Right where?!?)
Get em boy! (Right There) That's how we do... (Allright then)
This is for my dogs, this is for my dogs
Yo, where we at baby?!? (Creepin through the fog)
From then till now, don't ask me how
Know that we gon roll like them niggas and hit every block on the job

[Hook]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas acting up?!? Where the wolves at?

Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas acting up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you go'n pull that

[Verse 3]
I get tapes doing times, stomp niggas like grapes making wine
Five CD's with mad rhymes
Don't hit me with that positive shit, I know you lying
You really wanna stop niggas from dying? Stop niggas from trying
I cuz I ain't really got that time to waste
And I thought I told you to get these fucking bums out my face
Looking at you in your grill, I might be nice to cut
Once I split ya ass in two, you'll be twice as butt
Yeah, you right, I know ya style: pussy, cause I'm fucking it
Since we all right here, you hold my dick while he sucking it
Motherfucker, don't you know you'll never come near me
Shove ya head up ya ass, have you seein shit clearly
Never heard that D be running, cause D be gunning
I beat my dick and bust off in ya eye so you can see me coming
Empty clips and shells are what I leave behind
And if they get me with the joint, they hit me with a three-to-nine

[Hook]
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas acting up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you go'n pull that
Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?
Have that nigga in the cut, where the wood at?
Oh, them niggas acting up?!? Where the wolves at?
You better bust that if you go'n pull that

[Outro]
Where the fuckin hood at?!?
No ones' fuckin with me nigga, for real
I am the hood, I am the streets
You bitch ass nigga
Take it how you want, motherfucker
I’m in the hood all day
I think I’m like the only nigga, dog
That can go to the projects (School street, home of the brave)
By his fuckin self and be good
Yeah nigga, ask niggas on my projects (Y.O.)
When the last time they seen dog (Not too long ago baby)
Motherfucker..
Dee, waah, ugh… (Y'all niggas is homeless)
Kato… (Where the hood at?)

[Skinny DeVille]
Yeah...
Aww man, the grass done got green on the other side of the fence
So I hopped my ass over to see if I was convinced
Fast paced city life, but country livin's the sense
Cop me a Caddy say to hell with a Benz
Benz, Benz, twenty inch rims
I can't leave the vertical grill back at the ranch
Got a ""Phat"" farm with with cows and whole lotta land
Twenty acres (???)

[B. Stille]
Meanwhile up in the D where they hollowin up dope
And thugs blow weed in the park when the club close
In Mil-waukee the beats it petro
Off in D.C., the streets is ghetto
Let's roll - to Cali where they chief the best 'dro
And drive cars so big you can't reach the pedal
Never had a glass of purple juice for breakfast
Until I took my ass to Houston, Texas, that's country!

The whole damn world is country
Been all around the globe from Monday to Sunday
Y'all the same folk we see in Kentucky (it must mean)

Alright first say a prayer for those in combat
Might could throw somethin on the grill when you come back
Might could take a trip to the 'Ville and then back
We can all get loose on the 'Ports, and of course
Hit Churchill Downs and throw some on a horse
Or we can hit them Saint Claire waters
You ain't seen country till you been through Georgia
God durn, they still got girls with perms (dang)
Big cars, big wheels is the biggest concern

[Ron Clutch]
My old Kentucky home, I was
Born and raised on catfish and corn, collard greens and fatback
It's country than a mug, don't care where ya stay
Ya got country in ya blood if ya love 'em and that's that
Circled the globe, met the important and paid
Now I know for a fact that...

Woo!
Damn
There's a lot of bitches up in here tonight boy
I'm about to get drunk
Let's hold down
Where the bar at?
[Verse 1]
Okay, okie dokey Obie's here
No more Focus Hobo's got a career
And I like your brassiere and there's a party in here
And I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear
She erotic and it's hot, saw Heineken beer
Put it to the side and invite her to ""Cheers""
Pull up a chair, nigga swear no drama
Prepare for a player who's working with a monster
I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place
Shut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state
Concentrate, you will find that your bound to get
But we found what's fate
We can watch two incredible mates masterbate
Why settle and wait
Let's escalate to the nearest Super 8
And see your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin booty cheeks
C'mon

[Refrain]
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth

[Verse 2]
Okay holy moly derriere
Look around the club booty everywhere
She caught me starin
And my homies darin me to approach Karen
She's model material, but she got a venereal
Tons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal
She holla cause I got a lot of dinerio
The DJ's playin Obie song on the stereo
And she's impaired and she wants to be headin home
With the real thing not the dildo clone
And I know I don't wanna be headin home
With some double Ds full of silicon
Ten hoodrat chicks surround me outside
Found me outside, clown me outside
'Til I pop the trunk and they found me outside
Cussin at the bitches screamin ""off to they rides!""

[Refrain]
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth (uh huhh)
And this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, hopefully she got some teeth

[Verse 3]
Okay rolie polies everywhere
Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere
Obesity's glarin and she got me fearin
She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literally, like a box of Cheerios
Cherry cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls
I'm outta order cause I gotta big girl disorder
So better cover up that blubber or I'll split
(feet running away noise)
And I ain't got time to play
Let's investigate another place today
Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape
Dresses pettite, no window drapes

[Bridge]
Word to mother, they god damn Okra and beans
Got ya Opera and jeans
Seems to me a little lean cuisine
Wouldn't hurt much, hot don't touch

[Hook]
I've been travelin for some time {*echoes*}
With my fishin pole and my bottle of shine {*echoes*}
On these long dark dusty roads {*echoes*}
Lookin there's nowhere to go
I guess I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
I gotta hide away, far away
Cause I gotta find a way, to find my way
Ay-ay-ay ay-ay-ay aaay

[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
I left out from mama's with my thumb in the wind
The leaves on the ground, winter's comin again
Solid on the surface as I crumble within
But legends are made out of vulnerable men
So on the brink of death I still manage livin life
Cause so rarely in this world are these chances given twice
I indeed sold my soul, without glancing at the price
No instructions when I was handed this device
But with what I did get, I was more than generous
Put others over self on several instances
But I'm back on my feet without a hint of bitterness
And one way or another I shall have deliverance
So I say

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
Can you recall a time people loved you unconditionally?
Toast in the new south, this one is for history
Then I slipped fell and caused the number's injury
Called the same people and it's yo you just missed them B
This the formula, dammit Bubba you had it
Why'd you have to keep it Polo and New Balance?
Then they start to question whether you a true talent
Or just a redneck substance abuse addict
So then you hide away just to try to find your way
And now they back to callin you 200 times a day
I want all y'all to know, good or bad I'll remember it
And 10 million sold in the name of my deliverance

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
Nothing could atone for the pain you've endured
The blood you shed is still stainin' your velour
You took your wealth and knowledge and gave it to the poor
Only to discover that your savior's manure
Accepted me as kin, put before your younger brother
They put a lot on us hardly knowin' one another
I honestly can say that over time I've come to love you
Now we are brothers and together no one can touch us
It haunts me with regret I never met your baby girl
She's an angel on your shoulder helpin' us to save the world
This musical marriage is no coincidence
On my mama, Timmy, baby, we shall have deliverance
So we say

And let me tell you what I can't stand
When a women play the role of a man
Talking to a nigga like you got to hold his hand
Treat me like a sped, like he lack to understand
I know you know I ain't gone go for the short jacking all the time

Trying to get a lil laugh in your crack in

Hide behind your fake ass grin with your fake ass friend

You ain't nothing but a dividend
Say you suck and fuck but you ain't gettin nothin
That's a damn shame it ended like this
And I ain't got love for you bitch
Shoo fly don' bother me
Will I get back with her probably
Then I thought about it I won't
Do I really want you I don't
The headache I really don't want
So I'm going to leave her alone
Cause I can do bad on my own, that's why she gone
Every now and then you get mad
Sometime I make you sad

[Verse - 2]
Number one - drums go bump, bump, bump
This beat here will make your pum pum jump
If you's a fat one, put your clothes back on
Before you start putting pot holes in my lawn
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
I'm under attack like my name was Saddam
I am the bomb from New York to Milan
And I can write a song sicker than Jeffrey Dahm'
(Woop woop!) Don't touch my car alarm
Break in my car you will hear ""Viper Armed""
I've been a superstar since Daddy Kane was raw
I'm live on stage, c'mon and give me some applause
""Thank you! oh thank you, you all are so wonderful!""

[Interlude]
Listen up motherfuckers
You have five seconds to catch your breath
Five - four - three - two - one

[Verse - 3]
Pop that, pop that, make that money
Just keep it going, like the Energizer Bunny
Shake that, shake that, move it all around
Spank that, yank that, dutch back now
Freak him, freak her, whatever ya choice
Didn't come to judge, I came to get ya moist
Scream - (Who-di-whooooooo!) now my voice is lost
Can I get a ride on the white horse?

[Verse 1 - Ja Rule]
Fuck if they holl'in about Rule nigga, here's the real
I'll pop ya top like Champagne bottles that chill
Wear nothing but ice, smiles tinted up to The Greatest
Tell em I'm nice too, plus push them nice coupes
The Inc roll like duece man, I'm ol' G Bobby J
And we slinging soccer fields of yay
They don't respect that, don't get your mind around
You'll get it pushed back, y'all don't want that
I send em to the morgue while keepin my bitches bouncin fa sho
""In Da Club"" with no gun, got em taking it off
Can't help that, I'm the nigga that puts it down
Once I hit that, that's if I'm up in the Maybach
Fasten them holding the throwback, West 44 Lakers
Let's make no mistakes when these F's take place
We'll still proceed you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back nigga air out the space!
(C'mon!) We gon'

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Ja Rule]
The Rule be ""In Da Club"" rude motherfucker poppin the bubbly
When shit get ugly I hug the snub closely
But usually we still see your bitches
Dancin on some freak shit, trying to ride my dick
I can't handle it, lower their manners
To get they ass infront of my dick to dance, to B.I.G.'s ""One More Chance""
Catching hate from a glance, but I'm a giant
These niggas is mere ants, I'll stomp 'em wit a shank
Give bitches the back hand, pimp shit, it's not realistic
The game is helpless, let's not get it twisted
I'm young, wrapped, and gifted, but still at the bottom
And stuck somewhere between Gomorrah and Saddam
I'm here to make this rap shit hotter than Harlem
Fuck the dog cause the werewolves is out the prowl
We'll still proceed you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back nigga air out the space!
(C'mon!) We gon'

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ja Rule]
Like Bush and Saddam, I'm a find out
Where Em Laden's hiding and bomb him first
It could be much worse, I could be hotter than yo scrubs
Mask and glove, gun hot from burnin ass up
I'd rather be bossed up, wit a bunch of broads
The preachers daughter screaming out ""Fuck the Lord!""
I may have struck a chord, wit the Christians
But y'all got the freakiest bitches out of all the religions
And God gave me his blessings to handle my business
All these wanksta snitches, let the nina blow kisses
If she some how misses, he gon' meet the mistress
And ""Clap that boy"" like Birdman and Clipse
I got these niggas all over my dick, like hoes
I'm the star at these shows, I must be as hot as they come
We'll still proceed you with a gun in your face
When you got one in your waist, let's cock back nigga air out the space!
(C'mon!) We gon'

[Hook]

[Outro]
[Ja Rule] Yeah, my nigga Zino in this motherfucker

I'll teach you how to stunt
My wrists stay rocked up
My TV's pop up in a Maybach benz
I'll teach you how to stunt
Nigga you can't see me
My Bentley GT got smoke-gray tints
I'll teach you how to stunt
My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man
I'll teach you how to stunt
I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya mans
I'll teach you how to stunt

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Seven series BM, Six series benz
Twenty-four inches, Giovanni rims
R1 one wheel when I'm on one of them
Ma, that boy out there actin a fool that's him
They say I've changed man, I'm getting paper, I'm flashy
They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy
My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace
Stunt so hard, everybody got to watch me
And I don't really care if it's platinum or white gold
As long as the VS bling, look at that light show
In the hood they say Fifty man your sneaker look white yo
Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho
Banks is a sure thing, yall niggas might blow
I'm finna to drop that, so I suggest you lay low
Buck, he from Cashville, Ten-a-key nigga
We getting them ten a key, save ten for me nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I'm sensing a lot of tension now that I'm rappin
But the kids used to look up to you, what happened?
Me on the contrary, hand covered with platinum
Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one
On point, cuz you get R.I.P.'s when slacking
So the stash box big enough to squeeze the mack in
Yeah, I'm fairly new but I demand some respect
Cuz I already wear your advance on my neck
I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches
Blue yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers
I already figured out what to do with all my features
Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers
When it comes to stuntin' theres nothing you can teach us
We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us
Naww, I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt
Come with me out front, I'll teach you how to stunt

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Young Buck]
Chain so icy, you don't have to like me
In a throwback jersey, with the throwback nikes
I know you probably seen me with Cash Money from back in the days
The only thing changed is the numbers on the range
I bought me an old school and blew out the brains
The Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain
My sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing
And whodi now in trouble now that you in the game
Come on now, we all know gold is getting old
The ice in my teeth keep the Cristal cold
G-Unit homie, actin' like y'all don't know
Look, I can't even walk through the mall no more
I just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes
They never seen doors lift up on a car before
Don't be mad at me dog, that's all I know
That's how to show these fugazee how it's supposed to go

[Intro]
Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rapping, can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Hook]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (I spit it through the wire, man)
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all (There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man)
Through the fire (I'd gladly risk it all right now)
Through whatever, come what may (It's a life-or-death situation, man)
For a chance at loving you (Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man)
I'd take it all the way (It's your boy Kanye to the... Chi-town, what's goin' on?)
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin' to be lyin', I been tryin' to be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man

[Hook]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (I really apologize for everything right now if it's unclear at all, man)
For a chance to be with you (They got my mouth wired shut for like I dunno)
I'd gladly risk it all (The doctor said like six weeks, y'know he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw)
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may (I looked in the mirror)
For a chance at loving you  (And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man, I couldn't believe it)
I'd take it all the way (But I'm still here for y'all right now, man)
Right down to the wire (This what I got to say right here, dawg)
Even through the fire (Yeah, turn me up, yeah)

[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds
It was more like spoken word
Except he's really putting it down?
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, Driver 2 wants to sue
I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I...
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky
It was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

[Hook/Outro]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (Y'know what I'm saying?)
For a chance to be with you (When the doctor told me I had, um, that I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin, I said)
I'd gladly risk it all (""Dawg, don't you realize I'll never make it on a plane now?"")
Through the fire (""It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!"")
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you (She can't be serious, man)
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire
To the limit
Through the fire
To the limit
Through the fire
To the limit
Through the fire
To the limit

Treat these niggas like the Apollo
And I'm the Sandman
Tote a hundred grand
Cannon in the waistband
Looking for a sweet lick?
Well this is the wrong place, man
7-time felon, what I care about a case, man?
I'm campaigning to bury the hate
So say ya grace, man
Ay, I don't talk behind a nigga back
I say it in his face

I don't fake and I don't hate
Check my resume, nigga

Anywhere in the A nigga
How T.I.P. is highly respectable
And in the M.I.A. nigga
I'm tryna keep it professional

Finna have me snappin, I'm telling you
From the bottom of the Duval

[Verse 2]
Call me trouble man
Stayed in some trouble man
Some niggas still hating on shawty
But they some suckers, man!
Got a couple fans
That love to do nothing other than
Lick, suck, show 'nuff respect
But still I love 'em, man
Dig it, little pimping got the mind and the muscle
Stay down on his grind
Put the crown on the hustle
Ay, I could show you how to juggle anything
And make it double
Weed, blow, real estate, liquor store
With no trouble
Young Cassius Clay of my day
Marvin Gaye of my time
Tryna stay alive
Living how I say in my rhymes
My cousin used to tell me:
""Take this shit a day at a time""
And told me Friday, died Sunday
Wednesday in the ground
I still smile, cause somehow
I know he seeing me now
And so I'm doing all my shows
Just like he in the crowd

Ay, throw your lighters up for my cousin Toot
Aaliyah, Left Eye and Jam Master Jay

Grand Hustle man
Mo' hustles than Hustle Man
""But why the rubber band?""
It representing the struggle man!
My folk gonna trap
Until they come up with another plan
Stack a couple grand
To get theyself off they mama land
Gangsters who been serving
Since you was doing the running man
Went down, did 10
Back round and rich again
That's why I'm young
With the soul of an old man
I'm shell-shocked, get shot
Slow your roll, man
Still ride around
With the Glock on patrol, man
I ain't robbing
I'm just looking for that dro, man
For my niggas slanging blow, pimping hoes
Rollin' vogues, 24s
Let these other niggas know

Get the fuck back, get the fuck back already

Prove a nigga what you say
Meet me anywhere, I don't care
It don't matter to me
Cause if you fucking step
I'mma step in your vicinity
What, you think I'm a ho?
Nigga please!
You ain't on my level
Get some rank, bitch
While I'm digging your grave with a shovel
Time after time I ask myself
Is it really clever for you to get with me?
Bitch nigga you can never ever
Rank on my level, I push a Chevrolet pedal
If you niggas fuck with me
I got that chrome
Heavy metal
Never settle for less but always strive for the best
Most these niggas playing chief will put you straight to the test
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Don Peezy]
Look at my Benz, look at my Ac'
Look at my Navi' and my 'LacGet on my level?
Hell nah never that
I knew you wasn't real cause all ya do is chit-chat
Always slizzle-making
Sure I stay gone
Call us some broad to the Georgia Dome
Trying to get with me is like naps through a comb
They call me Don P aka ""Corleone""
Up in the club with my Cartiers on
Don't know if I'm high, drunk, or getting my roll on
He on the cell ""Can ya hear me?""
Hell nah
Get on my level
That's what I'm trying to tell y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 3: LA]

Bitch nigga step the fuck back, and if you think I'm jokin'
Ask them niggas that tried to play us
See 'em lying off in that coffin
Trillville, ATL swanging, swanging, throwing bows
Got some niggas that be hating busting slugs at my foes
If you thinking you can fuck with a nigga like me
Nah nigga. Get rich
Trillville and BME
What the fuck you talking about?
What, you deep?
Nigga what!
If a hater wanna hate then a hater getting bust
We ain't hard to find, nigga, so why you steadily talking shit?
I'm fixing to sick my dogs, ho
Pussy nigga, get big, nigga-ho

[Verse 4: Lil' Scrappy]
Get crunk out your brains when I spit this verse
I'm a blood-sucking vampire, my venom is worse
Head Bustas deal with dangerous thirsts
Shatter your bones in your chest and make your motherfuckin' heart burst
Don't worry now, best of the South on the map
Knock your thoughts out and leave your brains on your lap
Don't touch my Kangol, shorty... what's wrong with you?
I might drop my fist back and knock your grill through

[Produced by Timbaland]

[Intro]
You're now tuned into the muh'fuckin greatest
Turn the music up in the headphones
Tim, you can go and brush your shoulder off, nigga
I got you, yeah

[Hook]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 1]
I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me
From the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc

[Hook]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 2]
Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

[Hook]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 3]
Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler, homie, you a customer crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me?

[Hook]
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Intro]
Teen drinking, is very bad
Yo, I got a fake I.D. though
Yeah
Yeah, Yeah
Yo, two step wit' me, two step wit' me

[Verse 1]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the ninth and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the three to the two, to the one
Homeboy trippin' he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop, we do shit for fun
You ain't got one? Nigga you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from a hun
While she goin' down I'm braggin' on what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch give it back now you don't get none

[Hook x4]
Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)

[Verse 2]
Two, here comes the three to the four to the five
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in her eyes
Couple seconds pass now I'm lookin' at her thighs
Why she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Girl you 21 girl that's alright
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' wit' those fries
If so baby, can I get them super-sized?
Here comes the four to the three, to the two
She stay feelin' on my Johnson, right out the blue
Girl you super thick so I'm thinkin' thats cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run wit' the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
Three, then comes the four to the five, to the six
Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich
Yes single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched
Liquor wasted on me man, son of a bitch
Brushed it off now I'm back to gettin' lit
Wit' some orange juice man, this some good 'ish
Homeboy trippin' cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my click
Here comes the five to the four to the three
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club owner said, ""Kwon put out those trees""
Dude I don't care I'm a P.I.M.P!

[Verse 3]
Look, let me move to the left

Watch how my glu-te-us dangle
I do a one-two step STOP!
No I ain't done yet
Everybody in the club go to work
Tight jeans, crop shirts, short skirts
I'm gone rock to the beat till it hurt
I'm gone drop it on the street yeah you heard

Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You're far too kind

Now, can I get an encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!

[Verse 1]
Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime
I'm Young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country, but the blueberry still connect
On the low, but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect?! Yep, yep
Grand opening, grand closing
Goddamn, your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you gonna find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspiration
Soon you gonna see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for this generation

[Hook]
Now, can I get an encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waiting for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!

[Verse 2]
Look what you made me do! Look what I made for you!
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits; look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearing the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team!
And I need you to remember one thing
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales to sold out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore

[Interlude]
Ow, it's star time
This man is mean, he's killin' all y'all jive turkeys
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
Well, if y'all want more of the Jigga man
Then I need y'all to help me bring him back to stage
Say ""Hova!"", c'mon, say it!
Are y'all out there? C'mon, louder!
Yeah, now see that's what I'm talking about
They love you, Jigga! They love you, Jigga!

[Jay-Z]
I like the way this one feel
It's so mothafuckin' soulful, man

[Verse 3]
So this here is the victory lap
Then I'm leavin', that's how you get me back
After a year of them 16's, it's 1.2
And that's 2.4, and I'm only doin' two
You wanted to gain attention, new dudes
I can get you BET – and TRL, too
You want to be in the public, send your budget
Well, fuck it, I ain't budgin'
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me: all star-studded
Golfer above par like I putted
All ‘cause the shit I uttered was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this?
You want to bang, send Kanye change
Snd Just some dust, send Hip a grip
Then you gotta spit a little somethin' like this

You got your deal off your man, I got my deal off props (But you don't
Hear me)

And dubs on the black Benz (But you don't hear me)

Mostly yall cats with deals, y'all ain't hot man (But you don't

The game over, 'cause shit about to change over
It's 'bout time 'cause hip-hop need a make over (But you don't

But around my way that's how you get fucked up (But you don't hear

[Intro]
Oh you didn't think we could do it again
Twista, Kanye West, from Po Pimpin' to Poppin' Tags
From Champions to Slow Jammin', oh baby
We can even make you a overnight celebrity
Know what I'm saying, come on

[Hook: Kanye & Twista]
Why don't we play something these hoes'll like?
Drive whips I know they like
Twista, you told her, right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie, right
The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight

[Verse 1: Twista]
Girl I see you in them Apple Bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon '04 Range
Still sexy when you smoke that flame
Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming ""my, my, my, my""
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
Kick it with me I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right
Dre told me you the prototype
I can make you a celebrity overnight

[Hook: Kanye & Twista]
Why don't we play something these hoes'll like?
Drive whips I know they like

Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie, right

[Verse 2: Twista]
You want fame, you can take that path
Candlelights 'fore you take a bath
You got such a sensational ass
I'mma get you Jimmy Choo and Marc Jacob bags
I can cop her a 2003
Make her smile when she sees Spre's
I can get you on CDs and DVDs
Take you to BeBe's and BCBG
I can get you into places to be into
The people to know or show you things to get into
I wanna be your lover and your confidant
And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you
If you want the style, you can get ya girl
Y'all take a look at her, she got such an astonishing body
I can see ya in some Gucci or Robert Cavalli
And I bet she gon' put a hurt on 'em hard in the party
And you know you kill 'em in the club we go
You was born to be a pro, how you know who's taking photos
And I love you cause you freaky with the door closed
Drop it to the flo', let that go when you roll slow
And I love it when I hit it from the back
And you get on top of me and have a brother going ""oh-oh""
Girl I love how you roll me right
I can make you a celebrity overnight

[Bridge: Twista]
You see, see baby girl
You see how you make a brother break down

What you need from me, oh you wanna be a star

I can take you there, I can make sure
You've got all the finest things
Let me be your manager

[Outro: Twista]
Come here girl, I could see you bored
Tell you you're the queen that I see you for

Come here girl, you could hang if you bored

We about to do a show tonight
You looking good girl, show you right

See, Caroline, all the guys would say
She's mighty fine (mighty fine)
But mighty fine only got you somewhere
Half the time
And the other half either got you
Cussed out or coming up short
Yeah, now dig this
Now even though (even though)
You'd need a golden calculator
To divide (to divide)
The time it took to look inside
And realize
That real guys go for real
Down to Mars girls
Haha, yeah

See she's the reason for the word
Bitch (bitch)
I hope she's speeding on the way to the club
Tryna hurry up to get to some baller or singer or somebody like that
And try to put on her make up in the mirror
And crash, crash
Crash into a ditch
Just playing
She needs a golden calculator
To divide (to divide)
The time it takes to look inside

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said ""Shorty, would you call me?"" She said, ""Pardon me, are you balling?""
I said ""Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing""
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, dropping names she's weak
Tricking off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you
(Not support you, not support you)

[Hook: André 3000]
I know you'd like to think
Your shit don't stank
But lean a little bit closer, see
Roses really smell like

Better come back down to Mars

What happens when the dough gets low

1724,18795,D12,My Band,21,2004-03-27,"

[Intro: Eminem]
I don't know, dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
‘Cause I'm like the lead singer of a band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show, because…

[Hook: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So I get off stage, right, drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
""Sup? Ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please Marshall, please let me suck your cock""
And by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my a capellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
‘Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude! I just think you're trying to steal the light from me
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
‘Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me, because…

[Hook: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Bridge: Eminem]
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band, my band!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you?
ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift (oh, I thought you were Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with our dressing room?!
‘Cause my shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap, see, it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryin' to get on the map
Doing jumping jacks whiling get whipped on my back

[Verse 3: Kuniva & Kon Artis (Eminem)]
Look at Em's little punk ass thinking he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself taking all the flicks
Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
(No, I had an interview, not you two)
You gon' be late for soundcheck, man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up and his always sound best!
You know what, man? I'ma say something
Ayo Em! (You got somethin' to say?!) Man, nuttin
I thought you 'bout to tell him off, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up!
And you ain't even back me up when we supposed to be a crew
Man, I was 'bout to talk right after you, I swear
Aww, man, whatever I swear, man!

[Hook: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 4: Proof]
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Eminem: Ayo, it's…) Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey, dude, I love your band!)
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
(Eminem: Proof, carry my bag!) Bitch, carry your own!
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)

[Verse 5: Bizarre]
God damn it, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artis slipped me some crack
""Lose Yourself"" video – I was in the back
""Superman"" video – I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall! Ask us the questions!
Like who's D12? How we get started?
(What about Eminem?) Bitch, are you retarded?!
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and then couldn't get up
Fuck D12! I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne

[Break: Eminem]
Girl, why can't you see you're the only one for me?
And it just tears my ass apart
To know that you don't know my name
(Man, fuck this!) {*punch*}

[Hook: Bizarre]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
(Ha ha!) But they're all on me
Like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall!)
‘Cause once I blow, I know that I'll be the man (Yeah)
All because I'm the *mumbles*

[Bridge]
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band, my band!

[Bizarre]
The hottest boy band in the world – D12!

[Outro: Eminem]
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called My Salsa
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa

Where'd everybody go?

[Verse 1]
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move
I hope

[Hook]
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid cause we ain't spoke in so long

God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down

So long, so long

To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single dog, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

(Jesus walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down

The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

[Hook]
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics! You can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one; hit me!

[Hook]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one; hit me!

[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
""Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are""
I ain't stepping out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well, my glove compartment is locked
So is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack? You some type of lawyer or something? Somebody important or something?""
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come""
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one; hit me!

[Hook]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one; hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time, not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of having a pussy
But a pussy having no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothing sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, being a bitch ain't one; hit me!

[Hook]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one; hit me!

[Outro]
You crazy for this one, Rick
It's your boy

But I'm straight shorty, I ain't finna run out
Make her drip from the night 'til the sunlight

[Intro: Fat Joe]
Owwwwww!!! Yeah! My niggas!
Throw your hands in the air right now, man!
Feel this shit right here! Scott Storch, nigga!
Yeah, Khaled, I see you, nigga
Show Big Pun love! Uh! Yeah! Uh! Yo!

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I don't give a fuck about your faults or mishappens
Nigga, we from the Bronx, New York; shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the Squad got a scar on their face
It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mill' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad
As a youngin, was too much to cope with
Why you think muhfuckers nicknamed me Cook Coke shit?
Should've been called Armed Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny
I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
Just as long, I knew me and my peoples was gon' bubble
Came out the gate on some Flo-Jo shit
Fat nigga with the shotty was the logo, kid

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
I said, my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (Come on!)

[Verse 2: Remy Martin]
R to the Ezzy, M to the Yzzy
My arms stay breezy, the Don stay flizzy
Got a date at 8, I'm in the 7-4-fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride 'til I die
With a matchin' jacket, 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance, we boogie
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies
Listen, we don't pay admission
And the bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it
Said he liked my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, Money Ain't a Thing, nigga
We still the same niggas, flows just changed
Now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
I said, my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (Come on!)

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Now, we living better now, Coogi sweater now
And that G4 can fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
This is why I sport the chinchilla: to hurt they feelings
You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out in Vegas front row to all the fights and shit
If 5-0 boy come, then they'd proudly squeal
‘Cause half these rappers, they blow, like Derek Foreal
If you cross the line, damn right I'm gon' hurt you
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercial
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K crip walkin', like, ""That's what's up!""
Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the Rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the Rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship

[Hook: Fat Joe]
I said my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
I said, my niggas don't dance
We just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway
Now lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back (Come on!)

Steady sticking to the wall, give it up
Sneaking through the back door live it up
Got the champagne, pour me a cup
Got the girls looking raw in the front
Got a call your man's in town
Tell the bar, a-nother round
Got all my mans holding me down
Kinda thick ma, let's get down, so get wit it

[Intro - 50 Cent]
Yeah, It's 50 Cent, Young Buck
G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!

[Bridge - 50 Cent]
We get the club jumping from beginning to the end
Go shorty, we back up in this bitch again
We party, harder than you can imagine
You can run wit losers, or run wit winners that win

[Verse 1 - Young Buck]
I feel attention when I walk in the club
G-Unit to the socks, bitches all on a thug
Gimme a Henny on the rocks, and a bottle of bub
I don't need security, this for .4 Nickel enough
I came to ball wit y'all, buy up the bar and all
So bitches call ya hoes, and niggas call ya dogs
If you love ya wife keep her at home tonight
She might never come home again nigga, aight
Teeth, neck, wrists all lights my life's like
Riding in Cashville and running all stop lights
Homie is that real, I pray I keep living
My momma just had a dream of seeing me in prison
My daddy's a dope fiend, and I don't really miss him
Ain't seen him in 10 years and a nigga still living
The same old two step we move to a rhythm
50 holla get 'em Buck, you know I'm gonna get 'em, raaaaa!

[Hook - Young Buck]
I know you gon' let me shine and get mine
I know you gon' let me in wit this nine
I know you gon' let me smoke on my weed
I know you gon' let me drink wit no I.D
I know you gon' let me shine and get mine
I know you gon' let me in wit this nine
I know you gon' let me smoke on my weed
I know you gon' let me drink wit no I.D

[Verse 2 - Young Buck]
I know I'm sinning but I'm winning at the same time
Took a couple shots from a nigga tryin' to take mine
I'm back on the block, wit a chopper and a Tech nine
Niggas shooting cops in the hood running stop signs
G-UNIT, The Gang! Bitches doing what the thugs do
GDs, Vice Lords, Crips and the Bloods too
Move let me come through
Ain't a pair of handcuffs, can hold me
I'm riding in the old school listening to some oldies
My gold keep shinin', them hoes keep crying
The handle of my .45 outlined in diamonds
Just left Cashville, bout to fly to Miami
Hopin' Yayo watchin' Eminem, perform at the Grammys
The reason niggas like Eric Benet, probably can't stand me
Cause I know money will make Halle Berry come out them panties, bitch!
Y'all niggas in trouble they should of never let me in-in

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Young Buck]
Bet ya I can make them bounce back
Teach 'em how to stunt, teach em' how to counts stacks (yeah)
Now where ya hood at, Buck If you want to
We fifty deep up in here what you gon' do
Who want beef, I ain't come for no name calling
Don't be mad cause we is and you ain't balling
Getting money is my motto for you broke folks
You spend ya whole life paying on ya car notes
It's alright if you still on the block boy
See I'mma cold young thug, not a hot boy
You know I do this for the streets, and my peeps thats behind bars
As soon as they come home, I'll go and buy them all cars, Young Buck!

Hey daddy, I was feenin' for you

[Verse 1]
Bet they be like ""I know he tired of the nightlife
He want a wife, he just lookin' for the right type""
Yea right, I be ridin' through the city lights
My hat bent, gettin' high behind the 'lac tint
I'm chilllin' with Brazilian women, heavy accents
They black friends translatin', got'em all ass naked, adjacent
Have relations wit'em many places
Leavin' semen in they pretty faces
Make'em kiss they partners with it in they faces
Young pimpin' sprung women 'cross the 50 states
Got young ladies requestin' ""What's Yo Name"" on 50 stations
Askin' me what's a pussy popper, want a demonstration
But I ain't waitin' til the second date, I'm so impatient
Relieve'em of they aggravation, take'em rollerskatin'
On them Dayton's, tell'em ""Baby, stick with me, you goin' places""
Go replace'em, draw erase'em out my memory
Moist panties and wet sheets when they think of me

Yo, yo... uh..

Got'em in Houston, Virginia, New Orleans, ya heard me?
All the classy ones like to act like they a virgin
And the nasty ones like when I talk to'em dirty
But I'm breakin' the ice, got'em laughin' and flirtin'
They be, removin' they skirts when they hop in the 'burban
Once the flick start playin' and the E start kickin' in
Her girlfriend lickin' and she beggin' me to stick it in
That's why, I like chillin' with women who like women
Lightskinned... Asians, Jamaicans and white women
Indians, Italians, Haitians and Puerto Ricans
They be itchin' for they chance and waitin' in me to freak'em
They say..

Excuse me shawty, but I been watchin' you now for a while
Yo whole style, from yo toes to the way that you smile
And I hope you ain't offended by the way that this sounds
But uhh... all I keep thinkin' bout is layin' you down
And I'm, keepin' it pimpin', I ain't playin' around
Ain't got that kinda time cuz this the only day I'm in town
So come and, chill in the cut if you willin' to cut
And when you, give me a hug I be feelin' yo butt
Now so while for while we talkin', I'm fillin' yo cup
We killin' the bottle, wake up in dirty linen tomorrow
But tell me would it trouble you if we ended up at the W-
Sippin' on a malibu pine apple juice and a blunt or two
Now whachu wanna do? Opportunity's right in front of you
Know you used to meetin' dudes, dodgin'em for a month or two
But young pimpin' spit linen to the young women

[Eminem: Talking]
So I changed huh, you got a phone
Pick up and call me

[Hook: Eminem]
How Come.. we don't even talk no more and you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way no how. This bullshit can't be true
We family.. ain't a damn thing changed.. unless its you!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We were so young so full of life and vibranceSide by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succame to yours
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it your cold your touch is just like ice
And your eyes is a look of resentment I can sense it and I don't like it

[Hook: Eminem]

[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
'Fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first
For I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome
Bitch that I wasn't with I woulda hit it and quit
But you were planning to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her you would smoke in the car with her
Coming outta the bar with her stumbling half drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fucking other niggas musta hurt your pride or something
Cause you woof off at the mouth to people like you want it with me
When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your man and lying like she can't be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth
Don't hate the game or the player the one that's changing is you

[Hook: Eminem]

[Verse 3: Proof]
It gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch get to speaking all rude
Fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
Like my finger get to snapping and poof it just happen
But proof is just acting out the part he was thrown
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home
See the devil in your glance since the ghetto we been friends
Forever real intelligence that's forever till the end
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies
Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
(HOW COME) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?
(AND HOW COME) It's my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you play, you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face

And you know damn well you don't wanna feel the shell

Gun to my head, pressed dead to the wall

Split ya dome, put you straight, knock out all y'all
Hell no them boys don't play

The problem with you niggas is
You just talk to much
Man swang on a nigga, and fuck his ass up
And you can walk on by with yo nuts in a tub
I'll beat yo block if you really won't get crunk

Gettin' buck if you wanna and catch a bow
Keep yo pretty ass gul, beat your ass, and take your ho

If they ask you where I'm at I'm in the Melph pickin' up Chuck
In the chromed out bubblegum pickup truck
Slide on Josephine, holla at Lil Kia and pluck
My nigga Troy told me to keep it real as fuck
We bought the House of Blues tonight after the DJ in the Nolia
On Washington and Ferret, across the street from Babosca
But first I'm 'bout to snatch up all Saratoga
Head straight to foot action and snatch me two pair of Solja's
Take a left on Taladonna get a O of that doja
Tell â€~em right on my trail and hit the gars and let's roll up
I'm bout to hit Julio and get the blazes from soda

Where dat Melph at? Where da Yo at?

[Verse 1: Nelly]
It's summertime and I'm back again

100 thou' couldn't get ya one of these
I guarantee there ain't a flaw in one of these
200 thou' couldn't get you in the league
And 300 thou' you couldn't even buy the keys
I think ya need to add 50 more G's
Now shall I proceed?! (yes indeed!)
Ho! I need to see ya take it down to the floor
Spread your wings if you're real ma, fly real low
Pause for a second ma, grind real slow
And if you do it right Rodeo we'll go
Ho! I talk a lil Fred Siegel girl
Bonnie and Judy Lee but when she bad call Vida Guerra
Apple bottom wit a pearl underneath it
You talking like you don't need it, I can tell ya conceded
I like that in you, I don't see nothing wrong

You take baby girl and I'mma take shorty
With the sweat dripping all over her body
We gon' move if you wanna (oh!) groove if you wanna (oh!)
Fly ya north up ma and get rude if you wanna
Ain't got nothing to lose nor to prove
Baby girl soaking like she just got up out the pool, eh!
I know you're thirsty ma, go 'head and order what you want
Some call it tricking, go 'head call it what you want
I came to ball, I ain't come out here to front
Cause the black card'll pickup what the grey card won't
Her attractiveness, got me attacking this
Oh so fabulous! Booty is maximus!
She wanna fly south for the winter
I might just go down south just to win her
Hell naw she ain't gon leave me alone
Making plans for us to be at home
Take your pants off ma, you can leave your panties on
But first drop down and get your eagle on, whoa!

[Bridge - Nelly]
From the girls wit skinny waists to girls heavy set
C'mon flap your wings, c'mon flap your wings
To the girls wit extensions to the girls wit dreads
C'mon flap your wings, c'mon flap your wings
From the girls got it good living in the suburbs
C'mon flap your wings, c'mon flap your wings
To the ones in the ghetto wit their hands on their - curves
C'mon flap your wings, c'mon flap your wings, OH!

[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
I'm so fly, I got money
So that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy
I'm so high, I'm on point
And I could tell that you're jealous just by the look in your eye
And when I ride by
I don't care, G-Unit's going straight to the top this year
Nigga, I'm so fly, I got money
So that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Uh, Banks is fresh out the gutter
Too smooth to stutter
The Sig will melt a brother like two scoops of butter
Before I leave the crib I tell my mother I love her
Grab the burner
But she ain't concerned cause he's a earner
My bitch lays it out real nice for me to murder
We fight, wake up and fuck like Ike and Tina Turner
Its a privilege to ride with a celeb'
Cause them girls over here don't got a problem giving head
Paranoia is on ya', that's why ya' llama's in ya' bed
Fuck a rare Chinchilla, buy some armor for ya' head
Where the block I'm from
Niggas be damn near forty and still tucking
And niggas baby mama's is pregnant and still fucking
It's either cause they boyfriend's a scrub like Brillo
Cause Banks is cooler than the other side of the pillow
The chronic is blown for my niggas that got locked up and deported
And now they gotta go back home

[Hook]
I'm so fly, I got money
So that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy
I'm so high, I'm on point
And I could tell that you're jealous just by the look in your eye
And when I ride by
I don't care, G-Unit's going straight to the top this year
Nigga, I'm so fly, I got money
So that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Don't confuse me with these suckers
Cause when I spit, You'll hear more ""oh's""
Than a skip to my Lou move at the Rucker
Thank God for giving Banks the gift
You think that bandana makes you look gangsta
But all I see is a handkerchief
Nigga, there's no one out the click that freezes
Believe that, cause I ain't scared of shit but Jesus
Look dog, I don't run with the poodles
Difference is, I'm eating in Rome and you eating Roman Noodles
Ya' boy is corrupt kid
Banks'll send a bitch to the store
Just for a piece of cheesecake like Puff did
You chumps can't afford these homes
Look around, I got forty clones
Now Look down, that's forty stones
And that's only in the necklace
I'm bony and I'm reckless
It's Tony in a Lexus
I'm fresh out the gutter, scrap what ya' man thought
I'm in the hood with more straps than a Jan sport

[Hook]
I'm so fly, I got money
So that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy
I'm so high, I'm on point
And I could tell that you're jealous just by the look in your eye
And when I ride by
I don't care, G-Unit's going straight to the top this year
Nigga, I'm so fly, I got money
So that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
When I travel I know I'm gon' get stuck
Cause they harass us in the airport
Like I'm the one that's blowing shit up
I got the patience of a high school teacher
And a bright future
Why the fuck would I have a bomb on my sneaker?
All the goodie girls back off us
My hearts colder then Jack Frost is
We pack shows and attract bosses
Black clothes with my black Forces
A black rose for a rat's coffin
I'm blowing O's of that black coughing
Blow on the road then I'm back flossing
No one knows how much that's costing
Fuck ass, only the green moves me
I got a clean Uzi
A pair of gloves and a mask from the Scream movie
So if you plotting on popping off, then scheme smoothly
Or get a little red splatter on ya' cream Coogi
My name ring each state
So you ain't gotta go all the way to L.A. to get ya MC ate

[Hook]
I'm so fly, I got money
So that's a good enough reason to buy the things I buy
I'm so high, I'm on point

Told you she's a ho (Groupie luv)
Yeah, lay me down in yo' town
An' I'm lookin' for some groupie luv
Can you help me out? Hey, Warren G, wassup?


[Verse 1: Warren G]
I need a ride or die groupie that can get dirty in Gucci
On the floor of the hoopty while she loving me up
I'm usually the instigator
But ain't nothing greater
Than a X-rater with a nickname like vibrator
I need to do a remix to ""Area Codes""
I..got..ho-oooes and plenty mo'
The way it kicks on time is out of control
So when my nigga Snoop Dogg comes and kicks the door

[Snoop Dogg]
When I walk up in the door
You best to know it's pimping on the hoes
213 gets the crunk for sure
And they know about us everywhere we go

[Warren G]
And where the groupies at?

[Pre-Hook: Nate Dogg & (Snoop Dogg)]
I was just about to call
'Till Snoop Dogg told me that he boned
'Till Warren G told me he rolled

You ain't got a bring nothing at all
Just enjoy the adventures of the Dogg

My rap, my pimp, my style

You got to let Nate hit it too
'Cus when we come to your town
Rule is pimps up, draws down

[Warren G]
And where the groupies at?

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
My fast scheme on them
We can tag team on them
That's what we need to do
Just me, G and you
It's cool when I'm seeing you
Get ready for a nine inch dick, me and the D in you
I know you don't want to miss this
Some classic LBC, 213 shit
We in your city get busy 'till you get dizzy
Trying to find all our fans
To load them up in our vans

We hate to end the show
But there's a lot of groupies at the door
Another everyone to take a see

[Verse 1]
Uh, my mind’s filled with mine fields
The ashes fall, the wine spills
The world stops, drops and rolls
It’s Judgment Day or a fire drill
Yea, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain’t never lyin' yea
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let em die

[Hook]
God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
The end of time is like a hour away

[Verse 2]
Damn, military minded, lost and can’t find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket. Bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there’s food for thought then I’m guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed yea
Now let it breathe, yea

[Verse 3]
Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she’s so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what’s appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain’t that a bitch? I’m just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshener
I don’t play, boy, I ain’t Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It’s a cold world, I put on a mink
There’s a chain of command, I’m the missing link

[Hook]
God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain’t promised today
And I’m smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet

[Outro]
Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I’mma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket. Bitch, sit on my rocket
I’m wired out the socket, but still shockin'
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today ?

Yo these niggas can't breathe when I come through
Hum too, some shoes, gotta be twenty, man
It's not even funny, they can't (breathe)
The chokehold's too tight
The left looks too right
You know what, you right
These bitches can't (breathe)
Look look, they hearts racing, they start chasing
But I'm so fast when I blow past that they can't (breathe)
In the presence of the man
Your future look better than your past if you present with the man
You better (breathe)

[Verse 1]
You niggas can't share my air
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear
And I'm getting better year by year, like they say wine do
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the K-9's through
And I pace myself
I know these money-hungry bitches wanna taste my wealth
But I keep em on a diet
Embrace they health, or either keep em on the quiet
And space myself and just take a deep breath
I got em grabbing they chest
Cause it's hurting them to see Fab in his best
And they in they worst
They'd rather see me lay in a hearse than lay in the 'Bach
And I ain't just laying a verse, I'm saying the facts
I came back with some sicker stones
That got these broke niggas looking at me
Like they choking on a chicken bone
Every chick I bone can't leave the dick alone
So I know it's one of them every time I flip my phone

Breathe!

[Verse 2]
I see them on the block when I passes
Looking like they need oxygen mask-es
I make it hard to (breathe)
But I keep the Glocks in the stashes
Cause the cops wanna lock and harass us
And make it hard to (breathe)
They has to react, like having an asthma attack
When they see the plasma in back
You dudes are wheezing behind me
My flow is like a coupe, breezing at ninety
That's the reason they signed me
The slick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts
Feels something like hard punches to the gut
How I address the haters and underestimaters
And ride up on em like they escalators
They shook up and hooked up to respirators
On they last breath talking to investigators
I'm a breath of fresh air in a fresh pair
Face it boo and do it till your face get blue
And then (breathe)

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Yo these niggas can't...
When the crew walk in it, pop a few corks in it
As quick as a tick in a New York minute
Catch a breath, 'fore you catch a left
Even worse, catch a Tef', only way you catch an F
To the A-B, it's in the May-B, rolling with my baby
Gripping on a toy that you won't find at KB
I rhyme slick on ya
They gon' have to put the Heimlich on ya
What you know bout letting dimes lick on ya
While you inhale the weed
And it won't stop till they inhale your seed
And it don't stop till I tell 'em to breathe
Like a doctor with a stethoscope
I don't see no fucking hope
Unless these motherfuckers breathe

[Outro]
Yeah, Brooklyn gotta
Uptown gotta
The Bronx gotta
Queens gotta
Staten Isle gotta
You niggas gotta
You bitches gotta

Two and then the three
Three and then the four

Down down down
Down down down
Down down down
Down okay
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop… pajama time

[Verse 1]
Come here, little kiddies! On my lap!
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah ah ah ah ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I've done touched on everything but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
To the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little ""poot poot,"" it's okay
*fart sound* Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Hook]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy! (ah ah ah ah ah)

It's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kind of breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna (touch my body)
Excuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Would you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
(Man, you must be up out your mind)
Dre (ah ah) beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm…

[Hook]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh, baby (ah ah) oh, baby, baby (ah ah)

[Verse 3]
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt naked
Down the street screamin' (ah ah ah ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said ""Save it, boy, we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady"" (Touch my body!)
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality; look, there's B. Rabbit!
""Oh, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man!""
Chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chuba chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chuba tellytubby
Fellas! (what?) fellas! (what?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (what?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or butt squeezin'
It's the season, just go (ah ah ah ah); it's so appeasin'

[Hook]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl… girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy! (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh, baby (ah ah) oh, baby, baby (ah ah)

[Outro]
Touch my body
Touch my body
Oooh boy, touch my body
I mean girl, touch my body

We could take a trip to the hood and back
And we could go and get a room, how hood is that
What'cha waitin on shorty, this a chance of ya ife
What I mean, what I see, in them jeans, what I like
You don't know what you missin, just quit talkin and listen
See I'm holdin up traffic, we just right here sittin

[Hook: Dre]
She wanna take me home and lay me up inside her home
She wanna turn me on, breakfast in the mornin'
She said ""Daddy let me take ya home
Papi let me take ya home""
And I said ""Mami you can take me home
If you let the whole crew get on"" (bitch)

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
I got this chick from Cali, profilin', she's whilin'
She's gangsta, she knows that she's got it like that
We was drivin on Crenshaw and cruisin for food when
She pulled up beside me sat off in a 'Lac
And I said ""Damn girl you actin like you don't know never seen me before
Episode of cribs on MTV, video what you think TS stand for?""
She said ""Terrific Sex"", yeah that's who and the diamonds is no facade
Used to be a broke nigga from the BX
Now I'm rich got the world screamin Terror Squad
Think about it now, everywhere we go
Every other city we tour, they never say no
Seems like every other night I got a different chick beggin me...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Remy Martin]
I was up in the club right had some Remy in my cup right
And that's when I peeped him, he was lookin so fresh and so cleaned up
From the fitted down to his sneakers
I really do mean this I ain't never seen this, there
Was some people standin in between us
I had to go over there so I could meet him I had him
Pimped up in the cut near the speakers
If he got a girl I know she's heated 'cuz right now I'm all he needin
If he, crush me then trust me it's a guarantee that he's not leavin
Told me he heard of me but don't know me and I liked him for some reason
Invited him to my place, sat on his face and I ain't got a man so it ain't cheatin
Think about it now, I don't gotta stress
I don't never really gotta press, they always say yes
It seems like every other night I got a different nigga beggin me...

[Hook (phone call)]

[Verse 3: Armageddon]
You's a big girl, eat it up
Now tell ya friend to hold your hair while you eatin' up
A little hot, little drunk, little weeded up
We in the truck and freakin off while the speakers bump
I'm steady speedin up swervin the bumps
I'm tryna fuck, but I ain't tryna fuck the 23's up
So I ease up, drunk and focused
Trynna watch the road but yo the back seats heatin up
And so I'm keepin' them, wish you could see them
I know you hear them breathin like you been possessed by a demon
I know you heated, wish you was here but, gotta go now have a good evening
Hang up the phone now, have a good weekend
Shorty just called the boat the front seat
And I think she's about to go down for a season
I know the horn ain't beep for no reason
3 in the mornin and actin indecent
She so horny damn this shit seems like every other
Night I got a group of chicks beggin me...

Heads up! Heads up!
Here's another one!
And a - and another one
OOHHHHHHHH!!!

[Hook]
Yeek yeek! (Woop woop!) why you all in my ear?!
Talking a whole bunch of shit that I ain't trying to hear!
Get back motherfucker, you don't know me like that!
(Get back motherfucker You don't know me like that)
Yeek yeek woop woop!! I ain't playing around!
Make one false move I'll take ya down
Get back muhfucker! You don't know me like that!
(Get back muhfucker!! You don't know me like that!!)

[Verse]
WHOO!! S-s-so c'mon c'mon
DON'T ... get swung on, swung on
It's the knick knack paddywhack, still ride in Cadillacs
Family off the street! made my homies put the baggies back
Still stacking plaques! (yep!) still action packed! (yep!)
And dough!! I keep it flipping like acrobats!
That's why I pack a mac, that'll crack 'em back
Cause on my waist there's more Heat than the Shaq Attack
But I ain't speaking about ballin, ballin
Just thinking about brawlin till y'all start bawlin
We all in together now, birds of a feather now
Just bought a plane so we changing the weather now
So put your brakes on, caps put your capes on
Or knock off your block, get dropped and have your face flown
Cause I'll prove it! scratch off the music!
Like hey little stupid! don't make me lose it!!

[Hook]

[Bridge - repeat 4x]
I came (I came) I saw (I saw)
I hit 'em right dead in the jaw (in the jaw)

[Verse]
See I caught 'em wit a right hook, caught 'em wit a jab
Caught 'em wit an uppercut, kicked 'em in his ass
Sent him on his way cause I ain't for that talk!
No trips to the county, I ain't for that walk!
We split like two pins at the end of a lane
We'll knock out your spotlight and put an end to your vain
Put a DTP pendant at the end of yo chain
Then put the booty of a Swisha at the end of a flame

[Hook]

[Bridge]
HEY! You want what wit me?!
I'm a tell you one time, don't FUCK wit me!
GET DOWN! Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
I'm having a bad day, don't make me take it out on you!
You want what wit me?!
I'm a tell you one time, don't FUCK wit me!
GET DOWN! Cause I ain't got nothing to lose
And I'm having a bad day, don't make me take it out on you!

[Verse]
Man! Cause I don't wanna do that
I want to have a good time and enjoy my Jack
Sit back and watch the women get drunk as hell
So I can wake up in the morning wit a story to tell
I know it's been a lil while since I been out the house!
But now I'm here, you wanna stand around running your mouth?!
I can't hear nothing you saying or spitting, so wassup!
Can't you see we in the club?! Man shut the fuck up!!

[Verse 1]
TIP comin live from the VIP, heard the night life lost life without me
Both the Feds and the State wanna see bout me
The whole city got bizzerk he got treat
Anotha nigga got a hit but shawty he not me
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed
Da king back now broads don't even know how to act now
Hit the club, strippers gettin' naked 'fore I sat down
Still ballin money stack taller than Shaq now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road doin shows puttin my mack down
Mississippi to Philly Albuquerque to Chatt Town

[Hook]
I got the crowd yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all my hotgirls yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

Once again what other rap nigga hooder than this
I got rich and I'm still on some hoolagin shit
You be rappin bout blow I was movin the shit
You talkin bout shootin out and I was doin the shit
If I hit you in the face you gon be suin and shit
And if I catch anotha case I know I'm truly to be missed
So I'mma keep it cool head stay out of the news
Headlines and shows other rappers its bedtime (bedtime)
It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed out hard top Carrerra to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit cause I get better wit time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine

[Hook]
I got a packed house yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)
Aye, all my hotgirls yellin (Bring 'em out, bring 'em out)

[Verse 3]
Mic check 1-2 1-2, you wanna beef wit the king what is you gon do
Will you show up on the scene wit 2 guns drew
Or you and ya friend and play a little two on two
If you knew half of what I knew then you'll be hittin the deck
Got a tool and a vest I can get some respect
I'mma make it hard for a sucka nigga to flex
Sho 'em this ain't the squad for a nigga to test
Pimp my nutz too large and we way too fresh
Work well wit Nines, AK's, and Tecs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You want beef you can bring ya best and we'll be standin..

[Hook - 2X]

Don't be a groupie, keep it movin', nigga you don't know me
Hey I ain't trippin' pimp, the truth is really, you don't know me

You be hatin' and I see why, cuz you don't know me

[Verse 1]
I think it's time I made a song for niggas who don't know me
I graduated out the streets, I'mma real O.G
I been trappin', shootin' pistols since I stood four feet
So all you niggas actin' bad, you gon have to show me
You gon make me bring this Chevy to a real slow creep
My niggas hangin' out the window, mouth fulla gold teeth
When the guns start poppin' wonder when it's gone cease
Chopper hit you in' the side an' create a slow leak
We can end the speculation cuz today we gone see
What's the future of a pussy nigga hatin' on me
I give a fuck about the FED's investigation on me
I don't care that they at my shows and they waitin' on me

Contrary to yo beliefs, I'm as real as you can be

[Verse 2]
Ay, once again let me remind you nigga, you don't know me
So don't be walkin' up and askin' whus tha deal on a key
I don't know if you wearin' wires, you could be the police
If I was slangin' blow you couldn't get a o.z
See me and the P.$.C. fallin' through at a show deep
Police holdin' up the door, cuz they know we tote heat
I just wanna ride wit C, blow dro' in the Fleet
Or with Clay with bout a dozen different bitches in a week
I just wanna chill wit Kuntry and his daddy Freddie G
Ballin' out at anytime, at any store we spend a G
Wanna ball in the Bahamas, courtesy of K.T
Mac Boney gotta mill, as well as Dolla D.P
A.K. house on the hill right next to J.G
Every week meet at Philant's restaurant and eat free
Get Inda paid, lil' Greg and B
That's the only shot we got at gettin' Cap back on the streets

[Hook]

[Bridge] (x2)
You see a nigga hatin' on a G, ask'em what it's gon be
Whachu lookin' at? Pussy nigga, you don't know me
At the club or in the streets, or wherever we should meet
It's choppas choppin', pistols poppin', nigga you don't know me

Yessir!

[Hook Vanessa Marquez and Pharrell]
Can I get more thrills?
(You know you want some more girl, so come on)
Can I get more thrills?
(You know you want some more girl, so come on
Let's get blown.. Let's get blown..)

[Snoop sings]
Looking at the ladies
All of them fly
I don't know which one I want dog
I can't make up my mind, girl

[Verse 1]
So won't you make it easy on me?
Take this drink, then hit this weed
Two step wit me, let's slip to the dance floor
On and on and on and on we go
I'll dip you if you want me to
You see I really wanna get a little front with you
Bigidy bump with you
A nigga wanna hump you and then just comfort you
And then I'll pop the top
And lay you on the cot, and get you nice and hot
Yeah yeah, it's all to the real
We could do it like Guy, come on girl ""Let's Chill""

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now you can fly the friendly skies
With the S-N double O-P, D-O double G-Y
Now don't ask why
Just keep looking good in the hood, damn girl, you so fly
We could do what you want to
You say you drink Alize or was is Malibu?
It don't really matter though
You remind me of the time when I had a ho
She kept telling me Doggy Dogg I gotta go
So I let her get in the wind and co-macked her friend
2 plus 2, it equals 4
This is some shit that could last forever more
I'm tryna put my bid in
Naw I'm just kidding, come on ma get in
And don't ask where we going, pimping and hoeing
Drink pouring and weed blowing, you know it come on!

[Hook]

[Snoop sings]
I've been looking at you, from the corner of my eyes
Checking out your hips, lips, tits and your thighs
I've been wanting to do you, for a mighty long time
You make a pimp wanna sing I - I - I

[Verse 3]
We'll head to the hills, your dreams I'll fulfill
We could do it how you want, cause I'm oh so real
Tell me you, naw I won't squeal
You wit Da Big Boss Dogg so seal the deal
Pharrell got the Babyface
And Dogg got the Whip Appeal, so name the place
This love I bring to you, on the real baby girl
Won't you do me a favor and sing for Snoop

[Hook]

[Outro: Pharrell]
You know you want it (If I got it I'mma give it to you)

[Intro]
Yeah, I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier!
Stiffen up that upper lip!
What you cryin' about? You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom
And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
But I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad
Even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
‘Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls, when it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Looking puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move
Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see
But you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over
And that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now
And we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me
‘Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
‘Cause Daddy felt like a bum, see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed
Or shot up on the block
And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars
'Til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguing a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing Daddy on the TV
And Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
‘Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscing, looking at your baby pictures
It just trips me out to see how much you both have grown
It's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talking to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sssshhh! Momma's only gone for the moment

[Hook]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now
And we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Outro]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat; don't fuck with Dad! Ha ha!

Nigga ask about me
Yeah, yeah, nigga ask about me
I'm a hustler, I'm a - I'm a hustler, homey
I'm a hustler, I'm a - I'm a hustler, homey

[Verse 1]
I'm a hustler, I'm a - I'm a hustler homey
I got the product, narcotics for the customers, homey
Fiend's open, they be smoking like a muffler, homey
Niggas phony so I only got a couple of homies
If you a hustler I could - I could fuck with you, homey
You spend a couple of bucks I'll stay in touch with you, homey
I get money I get 20 a K, I got 20 strips all doing 20 a day - ay!
I get cake from buds and haze: I'm making dubs
They hating cause I'm on the grind like I'm making love
With cops, got the block hot like a Jamaican clubs
Cop weight, wait for a drought and then make it flood
Try to take my cake you gonna take a slug
But you can take my information if you taking drugs
'Cause I could sell Raid to a bug
I'm a hustler: I can sell salt to a slug

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm married to the game, same bride just a new groom
I do more then just do tunes
Cause my bills come in too soon, my son gonna be 2 soon
Royalty checks come like once in a blue moon
But I'm getting my dough from doing shows
I made more dough on the grind than going gold
That's why I stay fly and I'm 'flage-ing on hoes
Floss is so cool: in Austin no shoes
Just a rubberband on my wrist, no jewels
I ain't got to prove I'm rich, I'm no fool
I know the rules and I ain't got time for it
But a nigga will shine, when it's time for it
And they will hate you deal with the real cake
And they on the corner from morning to real late
I deal weight and if you bastards doubt me
I'm a hustler: ask about me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, paid, you got save, don't be spending the change
In 5th grade I was hustling my Genesis games
I was dumb, young - selling chewing gum to my classmates
On the cash chase moving at a fast pace
Never been a dummy, never did what the dummies do
So I had a mill' to burn before I turned 22
""More money, more problems"" is true
Because the more money I make, the more problems for you
Yeah, I used dude's voice: props to the boy Shawn
He made it a hot line, I made a hot song
So, stop drawing, man, you got to respect it
I'm the best: Swizz got to perfect it, don't mess with
C-A-double-S-I-D-Y
Cause I became the best when B-I-G died
The Kid do it big like P-U-N
Cause I'm nice P-A-C with the P-E-N

I'm never going nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans' veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin to sign me
Respected highly, ""Hi, Mr. O'Reilly!""
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me

But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar

Eat her up like a sundae cone
But as of morning you got me open
Your tongue is stroking no joking
Coochie swollen, the bedroom smoking
Get some air up in this room girl
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
So I'mma take my time and do it right
Caz we got all night ..... caz we got all night, baby girl just

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'm on my grind, Grand Hustle
Got the mind and the muscle
50 carats in the crown just to shine on you suckas
I still tote the Glock 40 for the haters and the bustas
Fuck probation, if a nigga try to play me I'mma bust him
Ion't need no security, reaching for my jewelry
Get you niggas popped quick, filled full of hot shit
Fresh out the box Tip hopped in a drop 6
Made a quarter mil' in the pen givin' stock tips
Haters wanna stop Tip, mad 'cus they not Tip
Ball every summer so your baby mama jock Tip
You don't no drama pimp, I promise I do not slip
Chrome 4-5th, hid well if the cops trip
Bought my girl a Hummer with the chrome right in front of dat
5 carat stones with the platinum all up under dat
Rap beef I ain't gonna participate in none of dat
I'm aimin' at your fitted cap and you ain't gonna want none of dat

[Hook]
(Asap asap asap...)
A nigga try to play me, I'mma blow him off the map A-S-A-P
Ask anbody who runnin' a G, bet they finna say me A-S-A-P
Niggas hatin' on P.S.C. get straightened A-S-A-P
A nigga try to play me, I'mma blow him off the map A-S-A-P

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I know a lot of rappers don't like me, but they won't fight me
Feds swear I sell dope, well why they won't indict me?
Advances on the throne, I ain't never take it lightly
But all that tongue-wrestlin' hatin' while I'm gone don't excite me
How many rappers you know that could hold they own on Rice Street
East steady talkin' on the cell phone nightly
Normal population, half the jail just like me
Polices think I'm crazy, scared a nigga gon' strike me
Contrarily, a nigga tryin' me is unlikely
They barkin' don't bother me, I'll be bombin' 'fore they bite me
They just shocked to see my rap's exactly how my life be
Shiesty, with a conversation quite pricey
My fist so rocky and and wrist so icey
Might be, thrown off my rocker just slightly
Feisty, claimin' hot temper don't ignite me
I'm only gonna ask ya find the exit once politely

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Flip, say who known to the land and the people
My plan is to keep you at least 2, levels under me where I need you
I'mma take advantage of my chance to defeat you
Your true colors done shown, now it's on when I see you
I'm grown nigga, so let it be know we ain't equal
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' I can't reach you
Beat you, to a fuckin' pulp if I need to
The very spot ya standin' in then is where I'll leave you
Seen on the scene white tees and the v-suits
O.G. status, I don't beef unless I need to
Sissy you way outta line and you runnin' outta time
Hang behind closed do's when ya heard I got some time
Yeah I know you were thinkin' outa sight and outa mind
But I'm the wrong one for you to try if you were tryna shine
Listen nigga this shit here is more than just a lotta rhymes
I don't know what ya do for your respect, but I'mma die for mine

[Produced by Kanye West, Devo Springsteen and Jon Brion]

[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

[Hook]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
Does he write his own rhymes, well sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talked about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porscha"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't because

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
30 minutes later sein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call, you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

[Hook]

[Outro]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)

[Verse 1]
Mike Jones!!
Befo' I came up in the game these hoes didn't show no love
They see me in the club and used to treat me like a scrub
They wouldn't holla cause my dollars wasn't swoll enough
I bet they change they mind when them 84's come rollin up
They see that I'm a star, now they wanna sit in my car
Now they wanna count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my bar now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me now
They tellin' all they friends when I leave how they miss me now
2 8 1, 3 3 oh, 8 0 0 4
Hit Mike Jones up on the low cause Mike Jones about to blow
Befo' the ice was in my grill, before I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was heah, geah
Befo' the ice was in my grill, before I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was heah, geah
Befo' the ice was in my grill, before I got my major deal
These hoes wouldn't give a damn if I was heah, geah - because

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I remember back den, most of them hoes couldn't stand me
But now them same hoes beggin me to pull down they panties
A couple of 'em said I was cute but I was just too chubby
Same size a year later the same hoes wanna fuck me
Because they see me paid, pimpin pens, workin my jelly
And I ain't trippin' cause my pockets stick out mo' than my belly
They know I'm paid, livin' laid in the shade
Two slabs in the Escalade with fo' or five estates
Then know that I got it made, I'm a motherfuckin baller she would
Want a nigga now but I ain't got no time to call her
I'ma stall her like she stalled me, now she tryna call me
Bitch I'ma dog yo' hoe ass like you dogged me
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know the name
Ain't nothin' changed but my change, I'ma stay the same
I'm Mike Jones, don't act like you don't know the name
Ain't nothin' changed but my change, I'ma stay the same

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Befo' my paper came, befo' I got my fame
These hoes that's poppin on me now didn't even know my name
They said my flow was lame, they said I had no game
I told 'em all I was fin' to blow they thought I was insane
But then my name started blowin up quick, now they jumpin on my dick
Cause they see me on the rise and oh now my paper thick
But then my name started blowin up quick, now they jumpin on my dick
Because they see me on the rise and oh now my paper thick

I'm feelin' good now (yeah)

Lil Rob

I feel good, I feel alright
Cruisin' through my neighborhood on a warm summer night
I feel good.. that's right
I feel good now (somethin' about these summer nights)

[Hook]
(Whoa!) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down, I'll be ready to party
(Whoa! Hey!) Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Head to bo-lo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (whoa!)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

[Verse 1]
I just kicked it at home, I polished up the chrome
Called the ruca on the phone, let her know I'm home alone
It's, 7:30 and the sun's goin' down
It's a, summer night and the fun's goin' down
I pick her up and she looks all dolled up (she look good)
Sittin passenger in my rag Impala (yeah)
I let her know that she looks beautiful to me
The world's an ugly place but she is such a sight to see
The kind of woman, that would put up a fight for me
The kind that wants, to spend the summer nights with me
The temp was 80 and I'm cruisin with my lady
Playin some Ralphie Vagon, ooh baby baby
I see my homeboys and they're cruisin in their ride (hey wassup homes)
With their ladies, sittin by their side
People think we look crazy but I think we look classy
But then again, that's only if you ask me

[Hook]
(Whoa!) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down, I'll be ready to party
(Whoa! Hey!) Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Head to bo-lo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (whoa!)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

[Verse 2]
My homeboys throwin' a backyard boogie, so everybody
Gets together to unwind relax and have a fun time
The DJ's spinnin', so I grab the mic' and be like
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
The party's packed with beautiful women
And the gang of the homies, that wanna get with 'em
And they'll say anything just to hit 'em
And it's usually a nice summer night when they did 'em
I don't know, it must be, something in the air
Can't help but have a good time because the feelin is there
To some people, the feelin' is rare
They're at the pad sayin' God damn, I wish I was there
To have a drink, have a toke and hook up
With someone fine but the kind that looks up
Gotta keep some pisto' in the cup
Party until the sun comes up or we give up

[Hook]
(Whoa!) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down, I'll be ready to party
(Whoa! Hey!) Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Head to bo-lo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (whoa!)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

[Verse]
Them summer nights can keep a smile on your face
Gotta try to have a good time with this life, otherwise it's just a waste
Either way I'm gonna party just in case
Like Prince partied like it was 99 in 87, 88
I couldn't ask for no better weather
I'm right next to the Pacific, to be specific
The candy paint job, glows under the moonlight
As I close out my summer night and say goodnight
It's time to put the top up and park it
Drop it, unplug the ground, roll up the windows and lock it
Walk in the pad and fall into bed
As she lays on my chest to rest her sleepy head
And we do this all night long, from dusk 'til dawn
But it's not quite the same when summer nights are gone
But even when they're gone it won't be long
Eight more months then once again it's on

[Hook]
(Whoa!) Summer days just sittin' around
But when the sun goes down, I'll be ready to party
(Whoa! Hey!) Ain't nothin' like them summer nights
Keep the top on drop, all the girls lookin' hot
Head to bo-lo and we just don't stop
Party until the mornin' light (whoa!)
Ain't nothin' like them summer nights

You da the number one most requested in the club like one of my jams
But no matter what when I come in your right here where I am

[Verse 1: Baby Blue]
Don't know why but the ladies call me Baby Blue
The sticker, they take me and rape me
And make me their victim
I leave 'em, the freaks
But if they married, I stick 'em
And if they look like wifey material, then I keep 'em
Stunning through the city trying find a lady who's beautiful
But she gotta have booty too
Baby Blue don't let you do what you wanna do
You can feel on it if you really want to
Get a taste of this salami
Knock, knock, knock, knock you down like a tsunami
Busting you like a tummy
I'm ahead of my class
Getting head in the Jag
Look in the duffle bag
See Benjamin's head on the cash

Tryna beat it up like a everlast punching bag
Hotter than a Bisquik biscuit out the oven
Yo babymama go on missions to get this loving
We kissing and hugging
She never picked the phone up
You be looking for her while we be doing the grown up
She complain when she catch back spasms
But she loves when she get back to back orgasms
Yes, sir the game is off the map
You give it to them one time and they come back like addicts

Looking good, smack it baby
Pure pleasureful (That's all we got)
Let me drop my top
Pull up in the parking lot
Grab a grape soda, a bag of chips (That's all I got)
Park outside
Met up wit my homeboys
Fake guys, fake girl, leave me alone boy
Plus the Cadi looking good enought to eat
You can tell by the way the girls acting across the street
But on the other hand, Alfapha just hit me on my metro cell
Party in the park

So I jumped out the white Jag smooth like Shaft, come here girl

Abandoned when he was two
So the street side kids at the shopping mall was the family he knew
It's not easy being homeless sometimes you have to do
What you have to do and he didn't have a mom or dad to help him get through

I come from Bed-Stuy
Where niggas either do or they gon' die
Gotta keep the Ratchett close by
Someone murdered
Nobody seen, nobody heard it
Just another funeral service
Niggas will get at you
Come through shinin', they yap you
In broad daylight kidnap you
Best get clap through
Police stay on us like tattoos
Niggas only grind 'cuz we have to
MONEY IS POWER
Sling crack, weed, and powder
Fiends come through every hour
Its all about that dollar
And we no deal with cowards
Weak lamb get devoured
By the lion in the concrete jungle, the strong stand and rumble
The weak fold and crumble
It's the land of trouble
Brooklyn home of the greatest rappers
BIG comes first then the queen comes after

[Hook]
Now put your lighters up (Bed-Stuy)
Put your lighters up (New-York)
Put your lighters up (D.C.)
Keep putting your lighters up (Philadelphia)
Put your lighters up (Detroit)
Put your lighters up (Chi-town)
Keep putting them lighters up
No matter where you from, put your lighters up

[Verse 2]
Now, let me give you a walk through
Show you what to do and you don't do
Where it's not safe to go to
Them boys approach you
Better say quick who you close to
Don't come through if niggas don't know you
Cuz' people is talking
The streets is watching
The G's is lurking
Stash the nine in the garbage
The life of a hustler
The life of a gambler
Dice game, kill more niggas than cancer
You know who you fuck with
Brooklyn don't run, we run shit
Roll up and just bumrush shit
We don't play that
Out in Bk, not at all, for a pound leave your face on the wall
R.I.P in memory of, Never show thy enemies love
We get it on where we live
You better have a pass, when you cross that bridge
Welcome to Brooklyn

Damn homie I'm so tore
And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more
And I don't think I'm ever gone drink no more
But fuck it bartender you can give me one more

(Lighting the dutch like) And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more
(Passing the bub like) And I don't think I'm ever gone smoke no more
(Back at the bar like) Fuck it bartender you can give me one more

[Verse 3]
See, BIG done told you
I'm the hottest bitch on the planet
Biggest sex symbol, since Janet
The Zanotti bandit
Laying in the cut like a bandage
Come through Fulton St. in the vanquish
Doing them damage
And if you don't understand it
Then let me give it to you in Spanish
Soy la senorita mas Linda del barrios y lo es abo tu eres despacio
Still over in Brazil, Sipping Moscato
You must of forgot though
So I'mma take you back to the block yo
Put you on to how we rock yo
Some are boosting
12-year-olds prostituting
Hit-men hired for execution, There's no solution
Niggas still piss in the hallways
Fiends get high on em' all day
The youth them bang at the cops off the roof
If you don't know my town is the truth
Welcome to Brooklyn

Cause the girls we be poking ganja smoking
Best thing for the recreation to get the best girls in every nation
Topper girls we promotin' and supportin'
And them love how we flow king hear them shouting
First class ticket invitation girls from New York, England and Jamaican

Everyday...

[Hook:]
We be burnin' not concernin' what nobody want to say
We be earnin' dollars turning cause we mind de pon we pay
More than gold and oil and diamonds - girls, we need them everyday
Recognize it, pimpin' as we riding

[Verse 2:]
Girls them a page me want to raise me
True me write enough tune and drive them crazy
Well I man a true born Jamaican
Ready for the girls them in a every situation

We a the gal them pro, them know we flow
With the lyrical content that make them dip low and
Make the club keep jumpin'
Turn up the bass make you hear when that pumpin'

Summertime bounce to the music people choose it

Cause we a the girls them champion
Have enough a them like the great king Solomon

Many girls in a with eye sight sexy dress type

In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Joe you's a window shopper
In the dealership tryin to get a test drive
Nas you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse 1]
Summertime, white Porsche Carrera is milky
I'm on the grind, let my paper stack but I'm filthy
It's funny how niggas get to screw-facin' at me
Anyhow they ain't got the heart to get at me
I'll get down, Southside's the hood that I come from
So I don't cruise through nobody 'hood without my gun
They know the kid ain't gon' for all that bullshit
Try and stick me, I'mma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up
At the dice game who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right
When we got the tops... down, you can hear the systems thump
Nigga when we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Shut ya block down, quick to put a hole in a chump
Nigga when we rollin', rollin', rollin'

Niggas love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in
They come to scoop me up at LAX and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from Watts and from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin G at a bitch like a pimp, mane
Tell her, ""Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang.""
She can bring the lingerie with her, I sup-pose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just having no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mane
Listen mane, shit...changed, I came up, I'm doin my thang
Homey I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'
Oh shit mane, the store owner watchin' you
Before somethin' get stolen, stolen, stolen

Ya new girlfriend is old news
You ain't got enough green and she so blue

If you came to rep your set, right now nigga, let 'em know
If it's jail I get for stompin' a hater to sleep, fuck it, I go
Freak, I'll be off in the wheep
Straight geeked swerving down your street
In a stolen Bonneville with 23's on the feet
The Legend, Rocky D Brown, back in town to plea you down
Give me face, I love the sound
Slap the taste, they hit the ground
Back in the A
Cliqued up, picked up with some people that don't play
On that Kryptonite stay

My blunts I don't be lacing

Probable cause, call the canine unit to the side of the road, let's take a sniff (Arf, arf!)
Shit, the only thing we ridin' dirty is this UGK CD, Tackleberry
So may we be on our merry way?

[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma
Turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
""Daddy, look what I made!"", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
""Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?""
I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby

[Hook]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?""
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine!""
She's piling boxes in front of the door, tryin' to block it
""Daddy, please, Daddy, don't leave, Daddy—no, stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it with ya!""
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance
To do right—and it's tonight!
Now go out there and show 'em
That you love 'em 'fore it's too late!""
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone
And this spotlight is on, and I'm singing…

[Hook]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
""Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!""
But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, dad, and now you make Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanted to give you this coin
I get the point—fine, me and Mommy are goin'.""
But, baby, wait! ""It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real.""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream ""Die, Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes; the plane that I was supposed to be on crashes, and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin'
There's birds singin', it's Spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to…

[Hook]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn, rejoice
Every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back

With ya arms in the air immitate Fa-bo

When I walk up you niggas envy me
Cause I'm D4L you know who we be
Made ya first streak in 2003

And a bag of them pills and ya know I'm spinnin' like whoa

Ask Carlos, ask Fa-bo
Ask Lamar and Mook-B ask Bruski, they all know
Nope, I ain't really playin' with a ho
When the cat start sprayin' I ain't layin' with a ho
I catch 'em in the hood and hit with the fo'
Do my dance on that ho

Nope, I betcha can't do it like a G
Grab a tee and wipe the feet like met
Ain't gonna do it right but they still wanna see
And they all wanna but they can't do it like me

Nope, but I can do it like me
Shake the leg and get to it like me

So sexy the way you move
The way that you bend your body
Only keeps me in the mood
Get too exotic, so naughty

Let's triple X in sex sessions
Bring your body close to mine
I think it's time that you blow my mind
Even though this foreplay's fun
The night isn't done until we both cum

Standin on tha porch, drinkin liquor, drunk, smokin' weed
Trying to get a paycheck, but work that ain't came yet
Thats why I stay in a girl ear, to keep that pussy wet
So I could get paid and relax in the shade
And say fuck a nine to five cuz a nigga tired of slavin

Show no love 'cause you wassup

[Nitti: Intro]
Here we go again
Ghettoville U.S.A. (uh oh)
You know I go by the name Nitti right (uh huh)
I gotta introduce you to another motherfucker out my squad right(who this nigga mane)
This nigga go by the name of Joc (Joc?)
He resides in Collegepark (Collegepark C.P.)
But for right now, what we gotta do for y'all (what we gonna do)
We gotta give y'all a hit (huh)

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
Niggas in my face, damn near er' day
Ask a million questions like, Joc where ya' stay?
Tell 'em Collegepark, where they chop cars
Get twenty grand, spend a grand at the bar
Jest bought a zone, J's on my feet
I'm on that Patron, so get like me
'69 Cutlass with the bucket seats
Beat in my trunk, bought it just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood, posted at the store
Pistol in my lap, on the phone counting dough
If a girl choose, let her do her thing
Just like her mama, nice ass, nice brain
Er'body love me, I'm so fly
Niggas throw the deuces er'time I ride by
I know ya wonder why, I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what you do (OK)

[Hook: Yung Joc]
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me, guaranteed to go down

[Hook: Yung Joc]
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me, guaranteed to go down

[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
Verse number two, do the damn thing
Cubes on my neck, pockets full of Ben Frank's
When I'm in the mall, hoes just pause
I pop a few tags, give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work, make the block bump
Boys from the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boy magic, seven days a week
Number one record, long as Nitti on the beat
Oh I think they like me, better yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggas know my crew, we certified stars
Valet in the front 'bout thirty-five cars
Bitches in the back, black Beamer coupe's
Girls liking girls, time to recruit
If ya' got a problem, say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place

[Hook: Yung Joc]
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me, guaranteed to go down

[Verse 3: Yung Joc]
Time to set it off, let these nigga know
Have ya ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow, no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya' see the buckets on my feet
Fans on my trail, but they don't think I know
I keep my hands clean casue I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em, look 'em in they eyes
Ask me how I know, its me, surprise
Put it in the air, rep where ya' stay
Take a step back, blow the kush in they face
Stuntin' is a habit, let 'em see the karats
I'mma make it rain nigga, I ain't scared to share it

[Hook: Yung Joc]
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me, guaranteed to go down

[Outro: Yung Joc]
Yung Joc...
Nitty strikes again
This a Nitti beat

So So Def motherfucker

See most of my niggas really still deal cocaine

Talk about me cause these suckas scared to talk about me
Killers talkin' 'bout me, it ain't no talk about me
It ain't no walkin' round me, see all these killers round me
Lotta drug dealin' 'round me goin' down in Dade County
Don't tote no twenty-twos, Magnum cost me twenty-two
Sat it on them 22's, birds go for 22
Lil' mama super thick, she say she 22
She seen them 22's, we in room 222
I touch work like I'm Convertible Burt

[Intro]
Hey, T.I.P. pimpin'
Hey, shorty, why you gotta act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' to be nice to you

[Hook]
Go and tell a nigga no, with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so whack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 1]
Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo' face
Now, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing, that you need yo' space
Selling niggas is one thing, you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between yo' knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you making, get yo' knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I got a mansion and a gate, you with me you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in yo' chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in yo' dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex till you sweat, tongue kissing on yo' neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with yo' panties so wet?

[Hook]

[Talking]
This nigga playing mind games, man
I think the time came, that you mind changed you understand
Life is like a chess move, you need to make yo' next move
Yo' best move, keep it pimpin', you understand? Hey
I mean, you know what I'm saying
I done showed you how I feel, you know what I'm saying
I put myself all the way out there you know
The ball in yo' court, man
But I just got a question for you… Is you happy?

Whats up everybody
This your boy Juve The Great
Right here with my people sinister
And we about to take y'all back to the old school
That old school gangster shit
Check this shit out

[Juvenile]
We the only ones with work in the middle of the drought
Then them niggas round the corner come and see what we about
But we don't know they face so we don't want them by the house
But Skipper started bustin when he saw them pullin out
We did them niggas dirty for fuckin up our vibe
We packed up all our shit and moved it to the other side
Visited our spot this girl was on my dick
She said I love you Juvenile but you know you the shit
I grabbed on my Glock its where the fools hang out
I'm only tryin to hustle another change route
But they ain't gettin nothin if I ain't on beam
I'mma leave them niggas sufferin to find they own things
Workin with plenty for talkin 'bout hoes
I don't give them a penny, they comin out they clothes
Grabbin on my jimmy to see if nigga swole
Have to get it right with this big 'ol totem pole

[Hook]
Yes I'm thuggin Yes I'm clubbin
I ain't trippin on you look bitch I'm buzzin
Hoes and niggas I'm not lovin
Fuck what you gettin if I ain't got nothin
What's happenin, what's happenin, what's happenin with that
What's happenin, what's happenin, what's happenin with that
What's happenin, what's happenin, what's happenin, what's happenin
What's happenin, what's happenin, what's happenin with that

[Juvenile]
We pull up in front the club and my rims was lookin nice
The subwoofers bumpin, I need it in my life
We had a couple of fellas was stuntin with they eyes
We jump out of the Lexus and got they mind right
See I ain't gotta rep cause they know I got chains
You can catch me in that ? boy, that money green thang
Get a fish and shrimp po' boy and go sit on St. James
I'm a playa like my ole boy thats where I get game
Goes start passin cause they want me to see 'em
Ain't givin no action if they want some per diem
I keep a soldier rag from the A.M. to the P.M
My heater in my lap lookin great up in the B-M
I know them niggas watchin cause they know that I'm buck
But they can catch a hot one for fuckin with a thug
Nothin was poppin so we went in the club
All the hoes started jockin cause they knew who we was

[Hook]

[Juvenile]
The owner wasn't trippin, he let a nigga in an
The place was jumpin and the hoes was grinnin
Not at us though it was at the other women
Some was butterscotch some yellow like lemon
Had a couple of foul ones chicken and pigeons
Some was kinda fine but them bitches didn't listen
Told them meet us outside and hoes got missin
Put it in reverse and went back for more women
Everybody's rollin and you can really see it
Look at how they scopin for somebody to be with
I ain't on shit and Ive been G'in since the 80's
Ain't about goin somewhere probably then ""Beat It""
You already knowin the way that I'm rockin
If you anin goin then ain't nothin poppin
Now I'm about to leave cause these niggas eavesdroppin
I got my heater on me now an I don't have to cock it

And for the last 300 months
I made 16 albums with me on the front and they bump
Where you get your beats?
I heard 93 rappers say bitch like me
2 singers and 10 comedians
And I'm still gon' yell it every time you see me in
What's my favorite word?
BITCH!
Why they gotta say it like $hort?

Don't stop, just keep rollin' down hill
Crash and burn, can't stand, fall back
You're doin' too much, you can't handle all that
Man, it's been way too long
Time to let the whole world play your songs
Like me, my shit gets around
Leave the country, come back, and hit The Town
I'm in Miami, New York, and ATL
Houston and LA, ask Dave Chappelle about my rich bitch
He got it from me
And made 50 million dollars
I'm proud of you D

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
You ain't a hater can't tell
Either wish me well, go to hell or go to Yale
Study human behavior so that you know who the hell
You dealing with ain't nutty but the study going to unvail
My relative in jail (Ha) stay engaged
To whatever make money now he married to that cage
Divorce is not an option and prenunptial is void
Eat up whatever rapper but I'm tangled in my cord (hum)
Bored, kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle so I'm running from a shadow
An immpossible feat and I repeat
An immpossible feat and I repeat
An immpossible feat and I repeat!
The damsel's in distress but they a mess
They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think they getting warmer
They only getting colder hell, maybe I should throw
A double diamond party in the North Pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will tournament to see who can beat me
Better than me it's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style
But that's ok but just make sure you don't touch that dial
And we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool
Look, I'll get you hooked, y'all crooks might even move
To Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter
Start a new life, and all that wrong you do you make it right
But hell, all a dream I wear the crown I'm king
Respect is mandatory end of the story go fly a kite
Category ain't got none you know I'm right

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Congratulations I'm a player
I thought you were one too but now I hear you loud and clear
Subliminal, criminal minded niggas so be aware
Black dog broke out the pits and told yo' ass it's 'bout to tear
Intended for anyone fillin out this application
An estimate is needed for your under-estimation
I'm firing on the spot go back and check your calculations
Like a sniper in the bushes with that rifle I've been patiently waitin
Now that's a virtue; cause pussy nigga I'll hurt you
Like the president's approval rating by servin yo' ass with words fool
Slam yo' back to the curve bruh, like sanitation worker
Cause you're trash, I'm taking out the trash and all trash
Get mashed and compacted because it's no longer valid
Go head recyle, repackaged and put it back in my cabinet
Boy thats germs, I'm fresh up out the store every time
That nigga that B-I-G go hard every rhyme
Crowns all around I'm right after Martin Luther
No J R period senior cause Bamboo is Antwone Junior
Dungeon Family and biologicals intact
Talk bad about the fam catch diabolical attack
No gats or no raps, you get slapped about that
As a matter of fact, not fiction
Rumpelstiltskin you wack
Decipher words is like the Code of Da Vinci
Don't go against me, (Hey)
I want you to go out there and kill them marks boy is you with me
Mighty ighty ighty ighty ighty ighty O
The worse thing since crack-cocaine distributed to the poor
By the government, oh I meant, don't nobody know
Conspiracy theory, you be the judge, nobodys slow

Do your chain hang low?
Do it wobble to the flo'?
Do it shine in the light?
Is it platinum, is it gold?
Could you through it over your shoulder
If ya hot, it make ya cold?
Do yo chain hang low?

[Bridge: Jibbs]
Is that ya chain?
Bout twenty-four inches is how low I let it hang
Hop out the ride 'n' let the dime smoke off the range
Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang
You know the name
I'm off the chain
{Repeat}

[Verse 1: Jibbs]
Yea, yea, yea, yea, I'm hot kid
Chain so low you would think the diamonds never stopped it
And its funny cause you could never stop it
Bunch of rocks on my hand and I ain't even on the block kid
Show 'em white gold, sorta hold it like my timbs
And the chain hang 24 inches like the rims
Diamonds all blown up (yea) sorta like a pimp
So when the light hit the ice it starts glistenin' off the tip
My chain hang, all it do is bling-bling
(Half) blue, (half) red, like my diamonds gang-bang
And I don't even think we on the same thang
Yo I'm so heavy they couldn't lift it till the crane came (yea)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jibbs]
Yea, yea, yea, yea, I'm so icy
Charm so heavy that my neck don't like me
Gone, and no, no, no, its not a game
I'll throw my chain in the crowd like dang these (this is nothin')
Diamonds is nothin' to me
Especially when I'm dressin' up, its just a button to me (bling)
And not to mention my T's
Cuz they color coordinated, complimentin' the teeth (alright, thanx)
So check out my swag
Diamonds red, white, and blue like the American flag (its so colorful)
And see I got that nice cream
So much money I spent on jewels, I call it my ice cream
Give you a black eye cause of the beating
They think I am a mutant the way ya boy is beasting
I stay winning some time, you'll call it cheating
And my boys always around like it's a meeting

[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
Walk it out like an usher
If you say real talk, I probably won't trust ya
If you want to go to war, the gun's my pleasure
Even Jesus had twelve disciples on the lever, trigger, whatever
Pyong, you don't want nan day of three thou'
I'm like jury duty, you're new to this part of town
Your white tee, well to me, look like a nightgown
Make your Momma proud, take that thing two sizes down
Then you'll look like the man that you are or what you could be
I can I give a damn bout your car, but then I would be
If it was considered a classic before the drastic change
In production when cars were metal instead of plastic
Value, is what I'm talkin bout, take two of these and walk it out
You'll be the reason they chalk it out, you can't be the king in the parking lot
Forever, not saying I'm the best but til they find something better
I am here, no fear, write me a letter, til then
I walk it out, I walk it out, I walk it out, I walk it out
I walk it out, I walk it out, I walk it out
I Westside walk it ow-out, I Westside walk it ow-out
I Westside walk it ow-out, then Eastside walk it ow-out

[Verse 2: Unk]
I walked it out the bank, with a lot of zeros
That's what my teachers called me, predictions like they Cleo
So I do my dance for 'em, then make 'bout forty thousand
I do that in a month, I'm on resorts and islands
I make them walk it out, yeah, it's me again
But I'm with Jones, Daddy Fatsacks and Benjamin
I roll with made men, that brake the stage in
And keep the girls happy, so y'all can get the nappy
Gangsters they do they dance, they do it to my song
See I was up in Cali, Crip-walkin' it all night long
Drop twenty on my neck, got ten on my wrist
A billion dollar look, a million dollar kiss
I'm nationwide homey, you still at home homey
With no promotions on me, man that's bologna, homey
The album off in stores, I'm ""Beat'n Down Yo Block""
Now 'gwan and walk it out, they still on my jock

Now we don't walk it out, we drop-top Porsche it out
I hopped out floss it out, I bring my Air Forces out
I'm blowing purple smoke, I cough it out, ball it up then ball it out
Tap the bottle, pour it out, balling
Now do the fade-away, and throw some paper-way
And we can skate away, tell the office I'll be late today
Ho I can thug it out, or starstud it out
I take a trip with my bitch and Louis luggage out

You know that money ain't a thing we throwing thousand stacks
Ho yeah we toss it out, you know I'm talking bout

I walk it out like that last shot of 'gnac at the club
Cause the package store was closed and I'm attached to my buzz
Been slamming Cadillac doors, you know what it was cause
Stay jamming everything platinum check the status cause
Boy I side, brimming with diamonds but that don't mean shit
Designing fly-rhyme patterns since I was seventeen kid
On Southernplayalistic intro listen close to Peaches
She said nothing but king shit all day, and they be bi-tches
It's like I'm at the dentist cause everybody got crowns
I'll change to ace of spades, cutthroats, and won't bow down
Not a king queen or jack fade this, come clean son
Swing from my sack like my babies
Acting like you crazy, Daddy Fat don't like that misbehaving
A-Town's up and deuces down, and something else that be created
Tell Oomp, get the doomp, clear the booth it's now official
Dropping bombs like a North Korean nuclear missile

[Intro]
Push it to the limit

[Verse 1]
Port of Miami (uhh), I'm importin' the candy (uhh)
Ain't got nothin' to lose, we supportin' the family
Never traffic for fun, only traffic for funds
All I seen is the struggle, it's like I'm trapped in the slums
Workers were barely paid, no water, we barely bathe
There better be better days on the way that's on my daddy grave
I'm pushin' it hard, I'm pushin' it soft
If he pushin' a line, he pushin' for Ross
I waited and waited, I done ran out of patience
They hated and hated, left him slow dancin' with Satan
Fresh in my white tee, Mac-11, swear to God
I bought my first block, broke it down and tore the block apart

[Hook]
I push and I push, I ride and I ride
Tryna survive on 95
Put it all on the line every drop of a dime
I be pushin' them whips, yep, three at time
I'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (push it to the limit)
II'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (push it to the limit)

[Verse 2]
I handle dope like a vandal off the banana boat
Bananas in our rifles, no cyphers, I'm just the man to know
I paid dues, my moves done made news
I'm smooth, my suede shoes they new like ray-cial's
Nobody used to speak, now e'rybody wave
You duck your momma house, you set your sister straight
I'm buildin' a dream, with elevators in it
Tailor made the linen, no gators got on my hater-vision
I see ya, I see ya suckers, I see ya clear
I know you see me in that Phantom whiter than veneers
Allergic to broke, determined to blow
On the boat we hid the work in detergent and soap
We ship it from Haiti, baby I'm whippin' them babies
Let it dry, let it dry, try to whip a Mercedes
Arrangin' my Range, here to rain ya parade
You gotta push it to the limit you wanna be paid

[Hook]
I push and I push, I ride and I ride
Tryna survive on 95
Put it all on the line every drop of a dime
I be pushin' them whips, yep, three at time
I'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (push it to the limit)
II'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (push it to the limit)

[Verse 3]
We started minute, the money matured
My money's secured, I got bundles in Europe
My bubble be pure, it cost like a hundred a pull
The world is yours, hundred million or more
Now I run the streets, they all mine
12 years overdue, call it due time
I told you never roll on the soul of a soldier
You never know that dishwasher may be the beholder
Whoever thought that fat girl would grow into Oprah
Or that boy Rick Ross would be moldin' the culture
I push and push, we breakin' the mold
We push and we push, we rake in the hoes

[Hook]
I push and I push, I ride and I ride
Tryna survive on 95
Put it all on the line every drop of a dime
I be pushin' them whips, yep, three at time
I'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (push it to the limit)
II'm pushin' it, I'm pushin' it
I'm pushin' it, I gotta (push it to the limit)

[Intro]
I wear a mean dark pair of shades
And you can't see my eyes
Unless my head is bent, you dig

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, its like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 1]
Ya boy gettin paper (Money), I buy big cars (Foreign)
I need fly rides to drive in my garage (Choose one)
Stay sky high, twisted, Fly wit the stars (Twinkle ,Twinkle)
G4 Flights , 80 grand large (Ballin'!)
So we lean with it, pop with it (Bankhead)
'Vertible Jones, mean with the top missing (Flossin')
I'm sitting clean with the bottom kitted (do it)
I hopped out saggy jeans and my rock glistening (Ballin'!)
But I spent bout 8 grand
Mami on stage doing the rain dance (I think she like me)
She let it hit the floor, made it pop (What else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screaming ""fuck the cops""

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, its like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 2]
Slow down, tonight may be gone tomorrow (One chance)
So I speed through life like there's no tomorrow (Speeding)
100 Gs worth of ice on the Audemars (Flossy)
And we in the street life until they call the law (Ballin'!)
I made the whip get naked (What happened?)
While I switch gears, bitch looking at the bracelet
Step out, show me what you all about
Flashbacks of last night of me ballin' out (Harlem!)
One AM, we was at the club (What happened?)
2 a.m.: 10 bottles of bub (Money ain't a thing)
And about 3-something I was thinking about grub
So I stumbled to the car, threw the drinks and the drugs (Twisted)

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, its like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

[Verse 3]
Nigga, could you buy that?
I keep 20 in the pocket (Light Change)
Talk a buck 80 If the bentley is the topic (That Grey Poupon)
But of course gotta fly, where
To the hood to roll dice on the side of the curb
But I know a G a bet may sound absurd (Get Your Money Up)
Drive 80 up Lenox cause I got an urge (Speeding)
The rap game like the crack game
Lifestyles, rich and famous living in the fast lane (Ballin'!)
So when I bleep, shorty bleep back
Lou' Vuitton belt where I'mma keep all the heat strapped
I beat the trial over Rucker (Let's do it!)
All guns loaded and I'm back, motherfucker (Dipset)

[Hook]
We fly high, no lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Foreign rides, outside, its like showbiz (We in the building)
We stay fly, No Lie, you know this (Ballin'!)
Hips and thighs, oh my, stay focused

You niggas need to stay focused
When you're dealing with a motherfuckin' G
You know my name, Jones, One Eye, Capo Status
All the above motherfucka
This Dipset ByrdGang We Born To Fly
Y'all know the rules fall back or fall back
Someone tell my bitch summer I'm lookin for her
Ya dig, another day another dollar
Fast life fucker

Show me what you got, shorty

Hands up and waves, waves, waves, waves

Give the drummer some
I already gave the summer some
It's the winter's turn
Hovie Hov is the coldest
I'm just getting better with time
I'm like Opus One
Young, no two alike like a snowflake
Okay, show me what you got babe
Words is slurring, engine purring
Mami front, but I'm so determined
Shots of Patron, now she in the zone
I ain't talking bout the 2-3
Mami in the zone like the homie two-three
Jordan or James, makes no difference
We all ballin the same
Nigga, I am the Mike Jordan of recordin'
Nigga, you might want to fall back from recordin'
What you write is not important
So it forced him to go for the hype
For being brave they may applaud him
But misery, I will assure them
Aww baby, just ignore them
Truth or dare mami, listen and learn
I got a drop, I just took off the top
It's your turn

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
H.O.V.A., gold bottles of that Ace of Spade
Why even fool with these other guys, they all stingy
All these dudes know how to say is gimme
Gimme some head, gimme some brain
Gimme your number, gimme your name
But if I get one night baby girl, I swear
I'll make you tell these other dudes gimme got you here
I'll take you shopping, take long trips
I'll take the cork off, you can take sips
I'll take you there, take my time
Take your clothes off, you take off mine
Ma, show me what you got
Hovie in the spot, tried to told you I was hot
Tell these other dudes it's a wrap
Get the fuck out the throne you clone, the King's back!
Y'all got less than 2 months to get y'all thing together
Good luck

I don't know what life will be in H.I.P. H.O.P
Without the boy H.O.V
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, I'm ready
When kingdom come I'm ready

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Now everywhere I go they like HOV you back
Up out the corner office out the cul-de-sac
Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat
Get your swag back daddy where your focus at
Got to admit a little bit I was sick of rap
But despite that the boy is back
And I'm so evolved I'm so involved
I'm showing growth, I'm so in charge
I'm CEO and yeah going god
I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded
Selling blow in the park, this I know in my heart
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark
I been up in the office you might know him as Clark
But, just when you thought the whole world fell apart
I - take off the blazer loosen up the tie
Step inside the booth Superman is alive

[Hook]
The King Of New York New York
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor
When kingdom come, you ready?
When kingdom come, uh huh
Not only N.Y.C. I'm hip hop's savior
So after this flow you might owe me a favor


[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I hear ""hurry up Hov"" when I'm out in the public
Cause niggas like: ""but you love it; you be it, you're of it
""You breathe it, we need it; bring it back to the hustlas""
Had to dust off the Hammer dance, can't touch this
C'mon playboys, bring the cars back out
Cause ya boy Hov is back, you know them broads coming out
Got 'em dancing on the banquette, like they from Bankhead
Fuck Cristal, so they ask me what we drinking
I thought dudes remark was rude okay
So I moved on to Dom, Krug Rosé
And it's much bigger issues in the world, I know
But I first had to take care of the world I know
I'm from the bottom, so I still feel em from the bottom
Underdog before my cape, still couldn't stop him
Flash Gordon when recording, spark the light in the dark
Peter Park, Spider-Man, all I do is climb the charts

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Just when they thought it was all over
I put the whole world on my back and broad shoulders
The War-Hova, but who you know took over tracks like that
Guess what New York, New York - we back
And I ain't never been afraid of a drought
Since I was six, seventeen been getting money down South
Bout it, bout it, Master P
Ask the nigga Pimp C
Ask my homey Bun B
I run the streets the streets don't run we
Y'all run, we chill still waters run deep
I repeat, sing a long with me
I run the streets the streets don't run we
Ladies saying where you been Superman?
When niggas spending ten million in media on my hands
The Bruce Wayne of the game have no fear
When you need me just throw your ROC signs in the air, yeah!

Chea, you already know what this shit is nigga, remix nigga
Mannie Fresh, T.I.P what up, nigga? I got'cha nigga
I'ma show these niggas what to do on you, nigga

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I let my chain hang low get that thing up on my waist
All them haters talking reckless tell 'em say it to my face
Concealed bankroll, yeah, I almost caught a case
It's the remix so Mannie Fresh drop the bass
I say now 28 inches got me sitting so high
Reach straight up through the clouds God damn I'm in the sky
Got my 87 zone, goddammit I'm fly
Bet you anything won't nann' nigga try it
I push the Yukon Wednesday, the drop top Monday
Ice cream Impala same color as a sundae
So you can miss me with that hating and that ""He can't rap shit""
Tell them faggot-ass niggas wrap their lips around my dick
Goddamn my money's sick, hey, I need to see a doctor
Black on black Bentley call it ""Phantom of the Opera""
Lemon lime drop top, I call it a Sprite
When I pull out the garage you can call it at night

[Hook x2: T.I.]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Dro, my trunk gon' break the damn law
I'm riding through the hood with eighths of damn raw
Them 27's tall but them eights are damn raw
Bitches know they see the platinum is gray like grandpa
Spray the Chevy all kind of sour apple colors
Diamonds up in my charm look like pineapple suckers
TEC-9 for some, MAC-90 for others
Lethal weapon on Ducati's, I got on my Danny Glovers
Nah, this ain't the movie, but I shot four brothers
And plus I gotta Chevelle that flop four colors
Cars without the covers, my beat down low
I let my rims sit high, I'm the best thing blowing now

Hook x2

[Verse 3: Big Kuntry]
I got my treble up high and my beat down low
I don't slam no doors, hop in where the roof go
What I need a roof fo', replace it with the sky
Streets be mine with that Georgia on my mind
I ride in the wettest paint, like I'm surfing on a tidal wave
Cocaine whip, yeah, straight out the microwave
Man in the trunk, sound like the man knockin'
Five pass rocking with stacks in my pockets

[Verse 4: B.G.]
I got money in my pocket and my mind on mo'
To hear myself think, I like my beat down low
Cigarello full of 'dro and the chevy two-toned
It's sitting on chromes, that's how I get my roll on
Gotta dip through the hood, you know Gizzle keep it real
I see some hot girls, so I'm a turn it up a lil'
Let them bounce to the music, ba-bounce to the beat
The top down, hop in and ride with a G

Hook x2

[Verse 5: T.I.]
Even though I like my beat down low and my top let back
Chrome feet down low and my impala wet back
Ditch or dash, hit the gas tell them niggas check that
Make them bitches sit back woofers give 'em wet cats
Coming down in a Chevy motor sound like it very tight
It is you can tell I hear the tire yelling er' lane
And the way they ain't kicking I bet you could still hear it
Lord forbid I cut it up, I bet I could let Phil hear it
Okay my money real big, choppers is still here
They catch me with it fuck it I'm doing my lil bid
And my drop top riding with my Glock cocked riding
I'm looking for them niggas where they at stop hiding

You ain't cause you not (MIMS!)
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot

[Verse 1]
This is why I'm hot, I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill, sayin' nothing on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it, so I'mma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty, cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit that shit, I watch 'em (get it on the flo')
And if you need it hyphy, I'll take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it everyday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit LA
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way
And when I hit the Chi', people tell me that I'm fly
They like the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it, and simply I reply

[Hook: Mims]
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You hate cause you not
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You ain't cause you not (MIMS!)
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot

[Verse 2]
This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
16 bars, 24 a pop
44 a song, nigga gimme what chu got
I'm into drivin cars, fresh up off the lot
Im into shuttin stores down, just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me what chu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Avvve
I hit Wash. Heights with the money in the bag
We into big spendin', you see my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Playa you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga this is what I mean

[Hook: Mims]
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You hate cause you not
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You ain't cause you not (MIMS!)
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot

[Verse 3]
This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid, and I say yeah, I paid a gowp
And then I hit the switch, that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em ""All aboard""
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So everytime I see them, they tell me that's their song
They say I'm the bomb
They love the way the charm
Hangin from the neck, and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop 'n stare
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But little do they know, I keep them thangs by waist
Son I reply, nobody got to die
Similar to Lil' Weez cause I got the fire

[Hook: Mims]
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You hate cause you not
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot
I'm hot cause I'm fly
You ain't cause you not (MIMS!)
This is why (this is why)
This is why I'm hot

[Intro: Jay-Z]
You ain't got enough stamps in ya passport to fuck with Young H-O
(heh-heh-heh)
International . . . uhh
Show young boys how to do this thing
The maturation of Jay-Zeezy . . heh
Check me out

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
30's the new 20 nigga I'm so hot still (Uhh)
Better broad, better automobile (Uhh)
Bet a yard (Naw!) Bet a hundred mil
That by the song's end I'll probably start another trend
I know everything you wann' do
I did all that by the age of 21
By 22, I had that brand new Ac' coupe
I guess you could say that my legend just begun, I'm
Young enough to know the right car to buy
Yet grown enough not to put rims on it
I got that six-deuce with curtains, so you can't see me
And I didn't even have to put tints on it
I don't got the bright watch, I got the right watch
I don't buy out the bar, I bought the nightspot
I got the right stock, I got
Stockbrokers that's movin' it like white tops
I know you're like ""FUCK! This is child abuse, call DYFS!""
I must just be getting nicer
You young boys ain't ready for real
30's the new 20 nigga, I'm so hot still

[Hook 1: Jay-Z]
I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck
Bay boy, now I'm all grown up
I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Bay boy, now I'm all grown up
I used to play the block like that (like that)
I used to carry knots like that (like that)
Now I got Black cards, good credit and such
Bay boy cause I'm all grown up

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
30's the new 20 nigga, I'm on fire still
These young boys is like fire drills (Uhh)
False alarms (Uhh), the next don (Naw)
He ain't got it (Uhh), on to the next one (Young)
Still here (Yeah), still here like Mike
Gotta stop playin' with these children (Chea)
I'm a bully with the bucks (boots)
Don't let the patent leather shoes fool you youngin'
I got the fully in the tux
That was my past, now I'm so grown up
I don't got one gun on me
Gotta a sum on me to hire a gun army, get ya spun like laundry
And I'll be somewhere under palm trees, calmly listenin' to R&B
When we get the call he's, no longer with us, fire ya babysitters
You little fucks fall back for real
30's the new 20 nigga, I'm so hot still

[Hook 2: Jay-Z]
I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck
Baby boy, now I'm all grown up
I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy, now I'm all grown up
I used to wear my hoodie like that (like that)
Five deep in a hooptie like that (like that)
Now I got Black cards, good credit and such
Baby boy cause I'm all grown up

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
(heh-heh-heh)
Ya'll roll blunts, I smoke Cubans all day
Ya'll youngins chase, I'm Patronin' it straight
I like South Beach, but I'm in St. Tropez
Ya'll drink Dom, but not rosé (hey)
Ya chick shop at the mall
My chick burnin' down Bergdorf's
Comin' back with Birkin bags
Ya chick is like, ""What type of purse is that?""
I'm from the era where niggas don't snitch
You from the era where snitchin' is the shit
I'm afraid of the future (why?)
Ya'll respect the one who got shot, I respect the shooter
Ya'll go to parties to ice grill
I go to parties to party with nice girls
Young boys gotta chill
30's the new 20 nigga, I'm so hot still

[Hook 3: Jay-Z]
I used to let my pants sag, not givin' a fuck
Baby boy, now I'm all grown up
I used to cruise the used car lot, put chrome on the truck
Baby boy, now I'm all grown up
Ya, we used to ball like that (like that)
Now we own the ball team, holla back (holla back)

Yeah you cute, but don't let that *shit* go to yo' head
Cause what this cutie won't do, pimpin another one will
You prepured rockin a skirt and ya heels so tall
And we ain't wit none of that trickin but our bills so tall
I been peepin you fo' a while and you throwin it back
If you lookin fo you a balla, we got dough in da back
Look yo' color carmello brown and your skin so smooth
I'm havin fantasies about what you and me can do
And you an undacover freak, you probably thinking da same
I'm seein light up on yo face, because you peepin my chain
And I ain't tryin put you out thurr, as if you a freak

Pop lockin cock blockas, get up out da way
Let lil' mami get low, give a space let her sweat

From da window to da wall, lil' mama showin her thong

You ready then we can roll I'm tellin you we can go
I'm thinkin if I can handle it the way you make it roll
You groovin and speedin up, you right in between us
If you a strip-teaser, then baby don't tease us
At first I thought I was trippin but my vision gettin clearer
You movin that thang around as if you practice in the mirror
""She doin a new, dance,"" what the next man said
I'm like, ""Naw, she just pop lockin on a headstand""

Just bounce it and roll wit it and maybe you roll wit us
Pop lock and drop it, now pop lock and drop it fo' me

Tell me what you mean
Call me the Grinch, Shrek (yes)
All I like is green
I am Bruce Bling-steen
Step in the club then I grab her
If I want her I can have her
Mick Jagger with my swagger

[Bridge]
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Need another couple names
Shop Boyz, Lil Wayne (Jones) and Cha-military man (yeah)
Come do the show if I get the call
Tear up the club just to piss you off
Get on the bus and go hit the mall
And buy an earring the size of a crystal ball

[Intro]
When I'm out in N.Y., boy, it's blunts and Phillies
When I'm out in L.A., boy, it's wraps and Swishers
Now Blood walk to this, now Crip walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit

[Verse 1]
I'm in my Lambo, maggot, my fo' fo' faggot
Doors lift up, I'm like Go Go Gadget
See the shit I got on, homie, I'd hate too
My Teflon on, boy, my government issue
I'll hit your vertebrae, bullets rip through tissues
Your wife on the futon hugging that Shih Tzu
Homie, you a bitch, you got feminine ways
Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
I got fo' fifths and bananas on the K's
And got more whips than a runaway slave
Me and Yayo go back like some high top fades
When I made fifty mill, Em got paid
When I made sixty mill, Dre got paid
When I made eighty mill, Jimmy got paid
I ain't even gotta rap now, life is made
Said I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy, mane

[Hook]
I'm laughing straight to the bank with this
(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

[Verse 2]
I keep nothing but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll
I got the kind of money that the bank can't hold
Got it off the street movin bundles and O's
Seventy Three Caprice old school when I roll
Breeze pass with the E-Pass, fuck the toll
No more platinum, I'm wearing gold
I'm internationally known, it's the kid with the flow
That brings enough dough, it's never enough though
Shit I need mo', new shit out the sto'
Baby blue was old, fresh off the flo'
Stashbox by the dashbox in case they want war
Make the purple bring the green in, fuck the law
I'm oh so raw, I'm hot, I'm sure
I'm like the coolest motherfucker around the globe, boy
I set the club on fire I told ya
I'm the general; salute me soldier

[Hook]

[Outro]
Now work it out now, shorty work it out
I wanna see you, break it down
Now back it up now, you know what I'm about
It's like a bank job I'm in and I'm out
Now work it out now, work it out, work it out
Now work it out now, work it out, work it out

I know it's strange
But my brain's gone really insane
And I'm off the chain
Sipping on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slapping a nigga today (slap slap)
Slapping a nigga today
I feel like slapping a nigga today (slap slap)
Slapping a nigga today
Slapping a nigga today

[Verse 1]
This morning, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed (bed)
I'm sick of people putting lies in my head (head)
I don't really wanna work, I'm tired
I hate my 9 to 5
And I'm thinking bout killing my boss today
Killing my boss today
I'm thinking bout killing my boss today (it's just a thought man)
Killing my boss today (yeah)

Yesterday my best friend died (died)
Somebody came and took his life (life)
Now I'm looking up at the sky
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
And I'm asking why did you take him away?
Why did you take him away?
I'm asking why did you take him away? (why'd you take him?)
Why did you take him away? (hey)

I need some money please (please)
I can barely make it on these streets (these streets)
Cause I got a couple mouths to feed
My baby's in dire need
So I'm thinking bout robbing a bank today
Robbing a bank today
I'm thinking bout robbing a bank today
Robbing a bank today (real talk)

Baby mama's at home and fussing (fussing)
Calling up my mobile cussing (cussing)
Always yapping about this and that
But she really don't be talking bout nothing
Somebody take my pain away (Take my pain away)
Take my pain away (please)
Somebody take my pain away (hey)
Take my pain away (I can't take it)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Somebody just broke in my ride (ride)
Snatched up everything inside (inside)
Even got my 45
How am I supposed to survive
When I know that my stereo's taken away?
Stereo's taken away?
When I know that my stereo's taken away? (I need my music, man!)
Stereo's taken away? (hey!)

Gas prices are way too high
Rich people are way too fly
And I'm where I wanna be in my life
But why am I so behind?
Is it cause I'm wasting my time away?
Wasting my time away?
Is it cause I'm wasting my time away? (too lazy)
Wasting my time away? (I can't help it!)

My grandmama's nerves are bad (bad)
And everybody in the hood is mad (mad)
Cause President Bush could give a damn about our ass
So I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say (don't say nothing!)
Shit that he has to say
I don't wanna hear shit that he has to say
Shit that he has to say (woo!)

Troops gone and we still at war (war)
Nobody even really knows what for (what for)
Even more I'm scared to find what the world really has in store
Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (it's not promised, man)
Tomorrow's not promised today
Cause you know that tomorrow's not promised today (live like today could be your last, man!)
Tomorrow's not promised today (hey!)

Do it to the maximum, take it why you asking them?
Don't listen to them suckas when they say you too irrational
See I said I'm king and them lames started laughing
Same sucker now I want the king on the track
I composed several classics
U know like top back, dope boys
Bring em out, and what you know about that
Now they ask how I talk what you know about that
Dominated '06, now I'm going right back
See me reign hell, at a show just like that
Even Denzel'll say damn, I ain't know it like that
Yeah, still Bankhead you can tell
Ain't nothing changed but the name on the mail
Still kicking doors with them thangs in the air
Up in Benihana's, see me slang in dem chair

Stacks tall- ball playa from the stage to the air
Whether in Miami, Cincinnati or in Riverdale
Arizona, California, make it rain anywhere
Pullin that in public shorty who you think u finna scare?
I send a missiles at ya have ya going in your underwear
I tote a pair, fortyz on me, so you better tone it down
I suggest you juss prepare yourself for when it goin down
A-town, west side club, you should catch me
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro & Mac be
Jackers lying say they caught me slipping how could that be
I'm something like a stalker I be everywhere the strap be
The trap be, jumping with that 100 dollar slab
If I wanted I could get 100 on the tab
Sell em all double down do the math

Do it for my oldest sons and they Grand momma too
Do it for my daughters and my youngest son momma who
Go buy what she want becuz she know it ain't a problem to
You do something to them and it's you I bring the drama to
You do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two
I do it for my partner go make show them stuntin too
We do it with them plakas(?), ain't no problem where you running to?
We do it for the block, that why ain't nobody stopping me

[Hook]
Shorty, you ain't gotta take your panties off, just pull 'em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster baby come on and ride
It go up and down and round and round, stand up or get on the floor
It's on tonight, I know what you like, I know just how to break you off

[Verse 1]
Good evening ladies, I'll tell you from the start
I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park
There's lots of activities, fun things to do
And I'll find my pleasure in pleasing you
Some rides go fast, some rides go slow
You fear heights when I'm high, hell yeah I'll go low
It tastes so sweet that sticky cotton candy
We get carried away, we be starting a family
It's a perfect time for a magic trick
Girl, you know it's no fun without the magic stick
Now watch me as I pull a rabbit out a hat
Then you can use the rabbit all over your cat
Applause now, that's the first half of my act
I started out a pimp, now I'm more like a mac
I don't need your paper, just don't fuck with my stacks
(Oh, it's like that?) Yeah, it's like that

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now you can ride the horse around the carousel
Explosions, Trojans, all in the hotel
Put me to the test, girl, I don't fail
I work it out without a doubt
There's plenty water rides, I'm sure to get you wet in the park
Have your lusting seductions considered an art
Throw a hoop around the bottle, I'll be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like, you know I don't care
I really wanna thank ya for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak, but I'm being sincere
And your pass is valid all summer, my dear
So at your convenience you can always return
There's so many tricks to the trade you should learn
Suck that, lick that, swallow that lollipop
Forget that grip, that ride it nonstop

[Intro - Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la (Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do, act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My Momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2]
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homie this is my day
Class started 2 hours ago, oh am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apologing
Let me know if it's a problem then, aight man, holla then

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 3]
Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, UH, depending how you dress her
So if the devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort, cause when you try hard
That's when you die hard
Your homies looking like why God
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Hook: Kanye (w/ Young Jeezy)]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

All the girls jockin', beat steady knockin'
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin'
Shorty you can hate but your bitch steady watchin'
Bet she can't do it on a dick, she poppin'
We bottle poppin', you cock blockin'
Told your girl you rap, but your CD floppin'
You say you gettin' money man, we ain't seen nothin'
Your girl is persistant, she ain't stoppin'

Man she say she want a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin' ya'll know we run the town (hood nigga)
And I Keep A Bad Chick Around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown (hood nigga)
And my Chevy sit on 24's
Flat's look like flapjacks, pancakes, you ain't know (hood nigga)
I'ma play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'ma keep it hood folk

And I don't need a scale for the work
I can eyeball purp, I am not you jerk
Hatin' on me will make your situation worse
You don't wanna take a ride in that long black hearse
All eyes on me, shawty I'm a bomb first
I'm the truth and they say the truth hurts
Hustle mean hard work, hard work
If you scared go to church
Man this rap stuff is easy, every beat I get I murder

(Chorus)
Cause I'm a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin' ya'll know we run the town (hood nigga)
And I keep a bad chick around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown (hood nigga)
And my Chevy sit on 24's
Flat's look like flapjacks, pancakes, you ain't know (hood nigga)
I'ma play the game how it go
They can take me out the hood
But I'ma keep it hood folk

Get like you, naw, get like me
Eveesus we don't rock white tees
Classic Capris, but Knicks on the feet
Camo bathing apes, 10 pair every week
Menage 3, the girls suck me to sleep
Z-O-E climax to the beat
I see you, naw you see me
You'll see I see you fuckin' with me

(Chorus)
Watchin' out for gold diggers like Kanye
But I will play Beyonce, or Ashanti
Make Keyshia Cole say she shoulda cheated if she ever come my way
Get some head from Fantasia on the highway
Trickin' out magic city every Monday
It ain't trickin' if you got it that's what I say
You say? I say and what I say goes

All the girls jockin', beat steady knockin'
Middle of the stage got the whole club rockin'

And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, ‘cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
‘Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit

Open your mind you see the circus in the sky
I'm Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey with the pies
No matter how you slice it I'm your motherfuckin' guy
And just like a b-boy with 360 waves
Do the same with the pot, still come back beige
Whether right or southpaw, whether pot or the jar
Whip it around, it still comes back hard
So easily do I W-H-I-P
My repetition with wristses'll bring the kilo bidness
I got Creole, C.O. bitches for my niggas
Who slipped, became prisoners, trees taped to the visitors
You already know what the bidness is
Unnecessary commissary boy we live this shit
Niggas wanna bring the 80's back
That's okay with me, that's where they made me at
Except I don't write on the wall
I write my name in the history books, hustled in the hall (hustle in the hall)
Nah, I don't spin on my head
I spin my work in the pot so I can spend my bread

[Hook] (Pharrell)
And I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it
I ain't talkin' about it, I'm livin' it
I'm gettin' it, straight gettin' it
Ge-ge-ge-get get get it boy
(Don't waste your time fighting the life
Stay your course, and you'll understand)
Get it boy

[Verse 2]
It's '87 state of mind that I'm in (mind that I'm in)
In my prime, so for that time, I'm Rakim (I'm Rakim)
If it wasn't for the crime that I was in
But I wouldn't be the guy who rhymes it is that I'm in (that I'm in)
No pain, no profit, P, I repeat if you show me where the pot is (pot is)
Cherry M3's with the top back (top back)
Red and green G's all on my hat
North beach leathers, matching Gucci sweater
Gucci sneaks on to keep my outfit together
Whatever, hundred for the diamond chain
Can't you tell that I came from the dope game?
Blame Reagan for making me into a monster
Blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra
I ran contraband that they sponsored
Before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Push (push) money over broads, you got it, fuck Bush
Chef (chef), guess what I cooked?
Baked a lot of bread and kept it off the books
Rockstar, look, way before the bars my picture was getting took
Feds, they like wack rappers
Try as they may, they couldn't get me on the hook
D.A. wanna indict me
'cause fish scales in my veins like a Pisces
The Pyrex pot, rolled up my sleeves
Turn one into two like a Siamese
Twin when it end, I'mma stand as a man never dying on my knees
Last of a dying breed, so let the champagne pop
I partied for a while now I'm back to the block

[Hook]

[Outro: Frank Lucas]
Blue Magic, that's a brand name
Like Pepsi, that's a brand name
I stand behind it, I guarantee it
They know that, even if they don't know me anymore than they know the Chairman of General Mills

[Produced by LV, Sean C, and Diddy]

And the winner is Hov, my man! Speech!

[Verse 1]
First of all I wanna thank my connect
The most important person, with all due respect
Thanks to the duffle bag, the brown paper bag
The Nike shoe box for holding all this cash
Boys in blue who put green before the badge
The first pusher who ever made the stash
The Roc Boys in the building tonight
Oh what a feeling I'm feeling life
Thanks to the lames, niggas with bad aim
Thanks to a little change I tore you out the game
Bullet wounds will stop your buffoonery
Thanks to the pastor rapping at your eulogy
To Lil Kim and them, you know the women friend
Who carry the work cross state for a gentlemen
Yeah, thanks to all the hustlers
And most importantly you: the customer

[Hook (Kanye West)]
The Roc Boys in the building tonight
Oh what a feeling, I'm feeling life
You don't even gotta bring your paper out
We the dope boys of the year, drinks is on the house
(We in the house, house)
The Roc Boys in the building tonight
Look at how I'm chilling, I'm killing this ice
You don't even gotta bring ya purses out
We the dope boys of the year, drinks is on the house
(We in the house, house)
(We in the house, house)

[Verse 2]
Let ya hair down baby, I just hit a score
Pick any place on the planet, pick a shore
Take what the Forbes figured, then figure more
Cause they forgot to account what I did with the raw
Pick a time, let's pick apart some stores
Pick a weekend for freaking for figure fours
I figure frauds never hit a lick before
So they don't know the feeling when them things get across
Put ya hand out the window, feel the force
Feel the Porsche, hit defrost
Ice-cold, jewels got no flaws
Drop got no top, you on the top floor
Pink Rose, think OJ
I get away with murder when I sling yay
Heron got less steps than Britney
That means it ain't stepped on, dig me?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Red Porsches, rare portraits
Wear guns if you dare come near the fortress
This apple sauce is from the apple orchard
This kinda talk is only reserved for the bosses
Which means I get it from the ground
Which means you get it when I'm around
Rich niggas, black Bar Mitzvahs
Mazel tov, it's a celebration bitches, ""L'chaim!""
I wish for you a hundred years of success but it's my time
Cheers, toast to crime
Number one D-boy, shame he could rhyme

[Outro]
Sweet, let that ride out!
Bring the horns back in, yeah
This is black super hero music right here baby
American Gangsta
Taking flight, coming to a town near you
Soon as I touch down I just want ya'll to start playing the horns like...
Hovies home...Lukey baby
Hahahahaha...ow!

[Hook: Will.I.Am]
Once the love was strong
Now it's long, long gone
Cause the pain, came down like a storm
I remained, holding on
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you

[Verse 1: Common]
I've been thinking bout, I've been thinking bout
I've been thinking bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted to your love, feel I need another dose
I know it's a feeling that should be long gone
Things seem to come up when I hear our song
Golden brown girl, it seemed so long
Since I heard your voice, where did the king go wrong?
Emotions that, that they linger on
I guess cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls, I need your warm
The taste of your mouth, girl, I need your warm
Good food and love I need your warm
This here was made before we were born
A dreamer so I'm a keep dreaming on
It's kind of like 'The Breakup' with Jen and Vince Vaughn

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Common]
They say you don't know, know, know what you got
'Til what you got is gone
Yeah I like such and such, yo a lot but the feeling's not as strong
We were like 2 birds that were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Some days I would try but wasn't able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over you, my God
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess it's only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it reminds me of you
Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you
Hope the stars and the gods align me and you

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Common]
We do what we do and we do what we live
I love this way cause I got it as a kid
With so much to give from it, I never hid
The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared
My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say, girl you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather
Rain or sun we can sing this together

[Will.I.Am]
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you
Cause I want you, cause I want you
I want you, I want you

Havin' a drink, blowin' on a sweet
When I peeped this lil' freak out
I was all on the bar, went drift up
Shawty Redd came on
Then she hit the floor now
With a see-through dress
Long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Ms. Bo Peep
And a player know
If I take her home, with them real big hips
You so ripe, I'm gon' beep
So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a little bitty waist
I whisped in her ear, ""Lil' mama, what you drink?""
I know that you a freak, but you know I ain't gon' say shhhh
See, my game is outrageous
I got her to the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it wasn't no need for me to rush to bust one
Cause I wanted her to have an eruption

Thirty bands, fo shizzo

Big ups to all my haters

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Guard your woman dawg or I'll take her
You'll hear her scream from College Park to Decatur
I was a snotty nose with no paper
Now my crib sittin on twenty-two acres
Get it right fool I gets money (yep)
If you think Luda's not filthy you's a dummy (yep)
I was allergic to the roof on the cutty
So I took the top off like a Playboy Bunny
Catch me pimpin in a robe and some slippers
Riding down 85 while I'm stunting on my Gixxer
Mouth full of swishers or riding with your sister
And six David Beckhams or a trunk full of kickers
Take a picture of the mister it'll last long
And these haters get stretched out like a bad thong
So partner mash on or get mashed up
Think you can fuck with Luda then put a million of your cash up

[Verse 4: Plies]
Went from two ounces to a Maserati
First rap check bought choppers for everybody
Before they know what's under my shirt the Glock 40
Get twenty-five a show next month I want forty
Born a real nigga but I die a goon
Just bought a new choppa gon use it real soon
Got the streets on lock homie I can't lose
Put me anywhere I'm the realest nigga in the room
Take a look at me I'm what you call street approved

And that don't sound right
I swear you can get a full clip not a sound bite
SU-WU gang and if you ain't with it then you in the food chain
I'm in that wide body I'm a need two lanes
Blue seats white paint wetter than new rain
Like a white person with blue veins
I keep a black Glock red dot blue flame
Feet hanging out the window jock my shoe game
Cause all my kicks fly like Liu Kang
Old player new game
I'm focused I'm thinking like I got two brains
I'm in my prime I feel like a new Wayne
How come there is two women but ain't no two Waynes
I don't know what you do but I do thangs

Should've put us in a cage, cause we all off the chain
I'm a fool with it, catch me sagging my 'bauds
While I'm smelling like some Sherm, quarter ounce of that dope
Now I'm the nigga she chose, say she wanna leave with me
Middle of the floor with a drank, peeping the scenery
Fresh with a pistol, bought her ass with a triple beam
Blowing on some corn that clear my chest like antihistamine
Riding through the D, on my side where the pistol be
One in the chamber, think a nigga tryna get at me
When it thump at ya, it hit harder then a Nitty beat
Tell them hoes to show me something, they starting doing that dougie
Bout five of e'm fine, and two of em ugly
One kinda pudgy, she could still get my loving
Say she from Kentucky hollering bout some distant lover shit
The whole time I'm thinking bend over let me use this rubber bitch
My game on point so she had to fucking love it
I think, I think, I think she like my dougie

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 3: Lil' Wil]

Just gotta fade dressed to impress
Born with a shoe fetish, so you know I stay fresh
I ain't worried about that mess, a couple grand up on my chest
Plus Drew just brought a tech and I stay fresher then some zest
Don't want my shoes to get no specs, don't want no bitch to touch my neck
I'll tear this club up if I feel some disrespect
I just wanna find a chick, cause Lil' Wil just popped a X
And I don't wanna work hard cause I'm fiending for some sex
Do my dougie fresh and watch them hoes get to choosing
Middle of the club, jamming hard to my music
Bet you can't do me like a Triple X movie
Pull the dick up out ya pussy, let it slap ya on the booty
Going hard in the Jacuzzi, Oh my god I like her chewing it
Scars still persuing cause I gave that thing a bruising
Don't know what I'm doing better check me out fully
Mix that Dougie fresh with that Northside boogie

Just got home I'm trying to chill but I {""Just can't keep still!""}
Gotta hit the block, get a little 'gnac
Fuck with the hood, see if niggas is good
Jake is on me asking me why my music all loud

I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?)
Yeah I know
Here I go
No matter what shorty, here I go
No matter what shorty

[Verse 2]
You let the blog sites and the magazines tell it
I'm sure to be in jail until 2027
Rather see me in the cell
Instead of this new McLaren
God will take you to hell, just to get you to heaven
So even though it's heavy, the load I will carry
Grin and still bear it, win and still share it
Apologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it
Life can change your directions, even when you ain't planned it
All you can do it handle it, worst thing you can do is panic
Use it to your advantage, avoid insanity manage
To conquer, every obstacle, make impossible possible
Even when winning illogical, losing is still far from optional
Yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital
But, when life throw punches, block and counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside mi casa too long, I did a song
To make it known that the king lives on pimpin'

[Hook]
I ain't dead (nah), I ain't done (nah)
I ain't scared (of what), I ain't run (from who)
But still I stand (yeah)
No matter what pimpin' here I am
No matter what remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?)
Yeah I know
Here I go
No matter what shorty, here I go
No matter what shorty

[Verse 3]
Even in solitude, there's still no hotter dude
I show you how to do, what you do, you ain't gotta clue
All you do is follow dudes
Sound like a lotta dudes
I'll weather whatever storm
Make it out without a bruise
I understand why, now when my hands tied
They take shots cause if I'm out there it's a landslide
But revenge is best served as a cold dish
And suckas will get served nigga, no shit
Guess it was understood, for me it was over with
But I don't quit, if you ain't noticed yet
They couldn't wait to say goodnight shorty
So they can try to rhyme, act and look like shorty
Go get a beat from Toomp, and make a hook like shorty
Before ya know it I'm back what it look like shorty
I lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here
Yeah, and I hope the picture painted clear
If your heart fill with faith then you can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin'
Easy, let go and let God deal with it

[Hook]
I ain't dead (nah), I ain't done (nah)
I ain't scared (of what), I ain't run (from who)
But still I stand (yeah)
No matter what pimpin' here I am
No matter what remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?)
Yeah I know
Here I go
No matter what shorty, here I go
No matter what shorty

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Somebody call the doctor man (re-mix)
It's like them haters out there got a sickness man that need to be cured
Hey hey hater Hey hey hey hater
Hey hey hey hey hey hi hi hi hater
Hey hey hey hater, Hey hey hey hater
Hey hey hey hey hey hi hi hi hater
Hi hi hi hi hi hello hello hater (Remix come on man yeahhhhhhhh!!!)

[Verse 1: Maino]
Look, don't hide I see you hater
I'mma wave hi when I greet you hater
I've been dyin' to meet you hater
Please don't leave me I need you hater
This is for the ones that's been prayin I'm gon' fail
They hatin', rather see me back in the cell
But I ain't in the jail my nigga I'm doin' good
Brooklyn we did it I'm keepin' it all hood
Keep hatin' I'm rollin' I'm goin' past you
Chicks like ""Oooh I like him you see his tattoos?""
(Go Maino) Look at me went from Smack DVD's to MTV
Pants hangin down on BET
Still in the streets nigga you see me

[Hook: Maino] (T.I.)
Hustle hard, stack paper, it's so right, y'all hate us
It's nothin, we major, you see me, hi hater
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater
Ay Maino, tell them haters get ready

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Ay Maino, tell them haters get ready
I ain't got time, too busy I'm flyin'
Over the Atlantics, three or fo' Hispanics
Strip dancin', no panties, askin' me to take advantage
Just imagine all the fun that I'm havin' (It's scary)
On average, I'm travelin', gettin that cabbage
Performin' in London, then I'm landin' in Paris (Hahaha!)
If I was you, frankly I'd be embarrassed
You carry no weight, words hold no merit
I talk big money, you can't understand it
My picture won't fit on yo' cameras
Go win two Grammys, build cribs for a few families
Then you can come back and holla at me
God dammit, it's sad but I could give a damn what a sucka think
Hustle hard, Grand Hustle, call us Hustle INC
Me and Maino, Jay'll ate it, just like brothers think
It's all about the music 'til it escalate to other things
Sucka seen the Bankhead-BK connection
You can hate it, but respect or else get dealt wit', bitch

[Hook: Maino]
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater

[Verse 3: Swizz Beatz]
OK OK, hi my name is Swizz, your name is, hater
So you see 'em, hi hater
On my watch, the Patek Philippe
I don't lose no sleep, cause I don't fuck with y'all haters
My car, the SLR, the engine tuned like it's a guitar
I'll leave y'all haters in the dust by far
I'm designin' planes y'all lookin' at cars (Lames)
Yeah! I try to keep the peace
If you keep talkin the hawk 'gon slide in 'em
What's up?! They all want the cake
But I'm a chef so I gotta show 'em how to bake (Get 'em)

[Verse 4: Plies]
Nine outta ten rappers - haters
They get emotional when they ain't got paper
When you get bigger than them then they hate ya
Fuck 'em cause I don't owe 'em no favors
When rappers hot, they praise ya
When rappers get cold, they spray ya
We smarter than most, ask my label
My first-week numbers, real major (Dayum)
Two hundred fourteen thousand sold, playa
Take by the minute now, half be my neighbor
I got a show, so I'mma talk to y'all later
Forty thousand a show - now hate

[Hook: Maino] (Jadakiss)
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater
(Hello How y'all doin?)

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
Yo, a million dollars worth of ice on
My wife beater show the pythons
Drug money kept the lights on, and besides the gunsmoke
The hate in the air is what kept the nights on
They gon' hate anyway screw bein nice to 'em
Till you send 'em some hot ones or you put the knife on 'em
Hi haters, it's me Jada
Might see me in the D with pink gators
Or I might be in the streets with three shakers
Ten head cracks in a row with sweet paper
Yeah I'm just tryin' to get my cash
The LP is on the way though, kiss my ass

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
I'm so NY, like the folks who make PlayStation
Yeah, I'm back, fresh off of hatecation
I let the haters take a break
Now I'mma let it out the bag like Jake the Snake
If it's one thing for sho', two things for certain
I'mma keep em up 'til my middle finger's hurtin
Naw, I ain't had a brush with beef yet
Some of y'all wake up hatin and ain't brushed your teeth yet
I come through, haters gotta know that I am paid
I be wavin' like I'm on the float of the parade
Hola, bonjour - hi hater
I keep it movin on hoes, call me vibrator
Los'

[Hook: Maino]
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater
Hi hater Hi hater You see me, hi hater

Five, six rides with rims and a body kit

[Intro]
I seen you jockin Jay-Z
Cause he got a Mercedes and you know about his ladies

[Hook]
I seen you jockin' Jay-Z (I'm so dope boy fresh!)

[Verse 1]
Whose house? Hov's no doubt
'bout the only rapper still getting money in the drought
I moves out, in the global, I'm a mogul
Fifty thousand feet in the air and I'm still on my mobile
Fuck talking 'bout the recession the shit's depressing
I rock with Obama but I ain't no politician
And I chill with the thugs and the gangsters too
I ain't a blood but I'm warring with the boys in blue
Crooked officer, crooked officer!
Why you wanna see me in a coffin sir?!
Is it against the law the way I'm flossin', sir?!
Benzes, Rolls Royces and Porsches, ugh!
Haters like, ""Hov why you still talkin money shit?""
Cause I like money, bitch!
I like fly shit, you like gossip
I let you do you, why you riding my tip?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
That bloke from Oasis said I couldn't play guitar
Somebody shoulda told him I'm a fucking rock star
Today is gonna be the day that I'm gonna throw it back to you
I'm living life as a rocker, I'm like Pimp C, partner
Comin down in Mercedes, peeling off on the boppers
Worldwide show, I'm coming down in a chopper
Hundred eighty thou screamin ""Hov!"" with the Roc up
It's too easy, I got ladies on shoulders showing me they chi-chis
I met honey at the show last year
And now I'm acting brand new like a world premier
Yeah, I know life ain't fair
But chill, baby girl, my girl is here
I got models in a mosh pit
Dancing off-beat, but they know the words to my shit!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You ain't gotta jock Jay-Z, jock fly shit
You ain't gotta jock me, homie, jock my chick
Jock her Zanotti's, she body you with her fit
No that's not Pilates, her body is just thick
You ain't gotta jock her, nigga, jock my clique
Jock the dope boys cause we all tossed bricks
Federales jock me while I'm crossing the bridge
Click, click, take a portrait of this
I ain't no pretty boy I got a gorgeous wrist
Cut handsome checks and my flow's pretty, sick
I'm some ghetto chic, I'm where the hood and high fashion meet
Ooh wee, I'm like the camouflauge Louis
How you niggas want it the tux or the toolie?!
Haters, I ain't mad at you, if I wasn't me I probably jock me too

[Chorus]
In the night I hear them talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 1]
How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talking to me though
You need to watch the way you talking to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things, but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back
And you gonna show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

[Chorus]
In the night I hear them talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Verse 2]
How could you be so Dr. Evil?
You bringing out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we wasn't gonna speak, so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gonna see
You'll never find nobody better than me

[Chorus]
In the night I hear them talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

[Bridge]
Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know about me and you
So I got something new to see
And you just gonna keep hating me
And we just gonna be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gonna take off tonight into the night

[Chorus]
In the night I hear them talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

(Intro)
Let's get it!
Ha Ha!
I know you like
Wonderin right now like, what the hell is this right?
Heh heh heh heh!!! I guess you bout to see right now

(bell rings)

Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, Move-Move if you wanna move
Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna

I don't undrestand how can I have so many ha-ters
Knowin I'm there father like my name is Darth Va-der
I can get you hemmed up while I'm bein tay-lored
Then I slide off to the side like a fa-der
Homie I'm the president, governor and ma-yor
I control everything, like a dic-ta-tor
Get you bix marked up, turn you into va-pors
If you got a problem get you swallowed like a cha-ser
Model on my arm no homie I don't have to pay her
All I have to do is tell her where I wanna take her
Catch us out in Italy, then we in Jamai-ca
Caught up in the rapture, like Anita Ba-ker
When I roll up on you niggas like a ska-ter
Move if you wanna when you see that red la-ser
No matter how you move bet that infrared will chase ya
Then I keep it movin, homie see you la-ter, Mims!

Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, Move-Move if you wanna move
Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna

I'm tryin to keep it cool, if you wanna, you can move, if you wanna
Tryin to have a little fun, maybe move a couple numbers but
When you movin numbers, all the haters start to wonder
Then they talk behind your back, in the breath they speakin under
Man I'm hot, like the sun, like the middle of the summer
Strike down in a flash, nigga you can call me thunder
Chicks call me Phil Drummond cuz I give 'em Diff'rent Strokes
Bahh Bahh Bahh Bahh, beat it up like a drummer
They can call it one-hit wonder, but I guess that means I'm one-up
Light a match, play with fire, that just means you gon' get burned up
In the river, where you turn up, 'cause they see I'm on the come-up
But it's our, turn, now, if you want it, take it from us
I don't need no goons by me, if you want it come and try me
We can do this broad day, in the middle of the lobby
Niggas say that they the shit, when they barely just a potty
When they problems turn to prolly and they prolly's turn to sorry
Tell em

Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, Move-Move if you wanna move
Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna
Move-Move if you wanna, if you wanna, if you wanna

Yeah, Na na na na
Yeah, Na na na na

Now me I'm the life of the party
A little bit of juice, little bit of the gin
A little bit of mo' play, bottles of the rose
Feel a little buzz, then I'm getting it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in
Now me I get it in, I get it in
Me I get it in, I get it in

[Verse 1]
Look as soon as I step in the club
I swear my nigga, you can feel the attention shift
Started around twelve ended up around two
I better leave with more hoes than I came here with
I can't be responsible for what I say or I do
When I talk intoxicated
Shorty say I told her I love her
I put her out the next morning saying bitch I must have been faded
I don't know what you heard about me but the word about me
That I'm no trick, I'm no sucker, I'm no chump
I be in the VIP, with my niggas round me
Saying y'all can have whatever you want

[Bridge]
Me I get it in
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink

[Verse 2]
I hate to say I told you so, but I told you so
I go hard when it's time to play
Shorty get to dropping it low, like the dancers do
In the Go-Go in front of me
She know I like to see her dance, she get to breaking it down
We get the bouncing outta control
Because I got a hell of a flow, we got paper to blow
My whole clique pop bottles galore
It's no secret the hood done peeped it
When we come through son, we look like bread
My '89 grind ,make my old nine shine
Like we been moving bricks round this bitch for years
I say I get it in it's because I get it in
Now shorty there a eight but her friend near a ten
I feeling a spend my G, she fuck with me I'm into win
I'm cooler than her ma then we do this shit again

[Bridge]
Me I get it in
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday
That's Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday we get it in
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink
I need a drink, give me a drink
I need a drink, shorty give me a drink

[Hook]
Na na na na, Now me I'm the life of the party
A little bit of juice, little bit of the gin
A little bit of mo' play, bottles of the rose
Feel a little buzz, then I'm getting it in

[Hook: set to A Flock of Seagulls ""I Ran""]
I run, the streets all night and day (the hood love Thug)
Cause I still run, the streets all night and day
(If you tryin to find me)
(I rep for my city, go hard for the hood)
(Still posted on the block, what's good?)
And I run, the streets all night and day (ha)
I can't stay away

[Slim Thug]
They don't make too many niggas like me
Bonifide hustler, certified G
Still got that work if you got the right fee
You thankin shit fake? Well nigga come see
It's bigger than the jewels, it's bigger than the cars
It's bigger than the fact that we fuckin rap stars
The street niggas know me, these boys got my contacts
Knowin any given minute I can come back
I put a bitch on I-10 and tell her run dat
Give her ten and tell her don't brang nuttin back
I'm still in the hood, I can't leave the streets
It's in my blood, I'm a thug 'til I be deceased

[Hook]

[Slim Thug]
It's hot on my block, somebody turn the fan on
I've been paid, I'm just tryin to turn my mans on
And get my bread strong, streets miss me when I'm gone
I ""Put On"" for my city like Jeezy's song
Please believe me homes; matter fact check my stats
I ain't drop in three years, but I'm back
Where the money at? That's the first question
You better pack a strap; that's the first lesson
Hard times got the whole United States stressin
I'm writin a book - ""How to Survive in a Recession""
Mr. Obama, we so tired of sellin crack
If you lookin for me ask the streets where I'm at

[Hook]

[Slim Thug]
It's home sweet home where the D-boys roam
Movin stone for stone, or zone for zone
All night gettin it on 'til 6 in the morn'
The shit I'm smokin on, stronger then cologne
You can probably smell the smoke through your headphones
If you still broke better get your bread long
Call me on that burner cause them feds on my phone
And I'mma run the streets 'til I'm under my headstone

She love to pop them tags, she love to drive the Jag
Whenever we alone, she throw away my phone
Cause she don't want no interuptions while we goin strong
My baby, my baby, don't be on that bullshit
My baby, my baby, know I keep a full clip
That's why I, let her hi-side in 745
Thats why I, take pride when I slide up in them thighs

She understand what I do, she trust me and keep it true
Even though I leave her lonely she knows that I love her too
While I'm hot I gotta get it, gotta stay on the grind
And she already know when I'm home, she take all my time

My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies that's home

That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my drink and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

[Verse 1]
I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Bankers Club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thirsty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup, let's get fucked up (Let's get fucked up!)
I'm next on the table, who want what
I am champion, at beer pong
Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it, otherwise you naked
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is, um

[Bridge]
Man I love college (Hey!)
And I love drinking (Hey!)
I love women (Hey!)
Man I love college (Hey!)

[Verse 2]
I can't tell you what I learned from school
But, I could tell you a story or two
Um yea, of course I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'til the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is

Put their drink, as high as they can

[Album Intro]
Welcome
Welcome to The E.N.D
Do not panic, there is nothing to fear
Everything around you is changing
Nothing stays the same
This version of myself is not permanent
Tomorrow, I will be different
The Energy Never Dies
Energy cannot be destroyed, or created
It always is, and it always will be
This is the end, and the beginning..
Forever infinite
Welcome

[Intro]
Guess who? D'you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!

[Hook: Charmagne Tripp]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see
You're a rock star
Everybody wants you, player
Who can really blame you?
We're the ones who made you

[Verse 1]
Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
""Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!""
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it and squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbians offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2; you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl
In fact, I see you grin; now come in, girl!

[Hook: Charmagne Tripp]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see
You're a rock star
Everybody wants you, player
Who can really blame you?
We're the ones who made you

[Verse 2]
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charlie-horse her
Sorry, Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler, and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim's

[Hook: Charmagne Tripp]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see
You're a rock star
Everybody wants you, player
Who can really blame you?
We're the ones who made you

[Pre-Verse: Eminem]
And that's why, my love
You'll never live without
I know you want me girl
‘Cause I can see you're checking me out
And baby, you know
You know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby
I'm the only one for you (*fart*)

[Verse 3]
Damn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
""Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!""
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl

When you walked through the door
It was clear to me
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see
You're a rock star
Everybody wants you, player
Who can really blame you?
We're the ones who made you
So Baby get down down down down
So Baby get down down down down
So Baby get down down down down
So Baby get down down down down
So Baby get down down down down
So Baby get down down down down
So Baby get down down down down
So Baby get down down get down

Amy! Rehab never looked so good!

Huh-huh, yo Mister D-O-Double-R

Chevy tuned up like a NASCAR pitstop (Yeah)
Fresh paint job (check) fresh inside (check)
Is the outside frame and the trunk wide? (Yes)
Are the rims big? (what?) Do it ride good? (good)
Lean back, right hand on the pinewood

Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside

Ice, ice cream, ice, ice, ice cream paint job

Got a house by the bayside (bayside)
Yeah, I'm livin' like that
And I'm ridin' like that (like that)
Boy I'm ridin' like that
And the steerin' wheel wood like a baseball bat

Rims so big, you can see me coming
Prime Time Click, we get money
Stay iced up like TV Johnny

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
I'm live (I'm live) like a Superbowl kickoff
My slab got a lot of niggas pissed off
Yeah paint shine like lip gloss
Cadillac got a wide body like Rick Ross
Took time but my cash got right
If I want it, I'mma buy it, I don't ask no price
Rearview mirror, jumbo dice
Trunk hit hard like Kimbo Slice
Be around tint, no window light
Car ride smooth so the rims alright
That right thurr, C.C. I like
Got the top notch slab for the dirt-cheap price
Press one button, car automatic start
Stand too close, car alarm might bark (Like what?)
ARGH, ARGH, like Q-Dawgs
Prime Time Click make it move like U-Haul

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
I ride with a towel cause the candy paint wet
Rims on the ride got these niggas upset
Rims sittin' high, so I ride upset
6 12's in the trunk, 4 screen's in the deck
I ride with a towel cause the candy paint wet
Rims on the ride got these niggas upset
Rims sittin' high, so I ride upset
6 12's in the trunk, 4 screen's in the deck

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Uh, I like a long haired, thick redbone
Open up her legs, then filet mignon that pussy
I'mma get in and on that pussy
If she let me in, I'mma own that pussy
Go on, throw it back and bust it open like you 'posed to
Girl I got that dope dick, now come here let me dope you
You gon' be a dope fiend, your friends should call you Dopey
Tell 'em keep my name out they mouth if they don't know me
Hah, but you can call me Tunechi
I'll fuck the whole group, baby I'm a groupie
My sex game is stupid, my head is the dumbest
I promise, I should be hooked on Phonics
Hah, but anyway, I think you're bionic
And I don't think you're beautiful, I think you're beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it and watch you
(Back it up and dump it, back-back it up and dump it)

[Hook: Lil' Wayne]
Cause we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and we like her too
And we like her and she like us too, and ohhh
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
Ohh-oh-ohhhhhhh

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, alright
She be jumpin' up and down, tryna fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they wanna talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin' them all
Young Money man, this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded, so please bring your finest
And what are all your names, again? We drunk, remind us
Are any of y'all into girls like I am? Let's be honest
She wants me, she wants me
Cause I got it all, shorty, tell me what you don't see?
I will fuck with all y'all, all of ya'll are beautiful
I just can't pick one, so you can never say I'm choosy hoes
And Wayne say, ""Pussy, pussy, pussy""
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all
Damn, and every time I think of staying with her
She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider man

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
I ain't being disrespectful, baby I'm just bein' Millz
And I don't know how fake feels, so I gotta keep it real
I just want to fuck every girl in the world
Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every high saditty chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Wilt, some married women or MILF
It don't matter who you is, miss, you can get the business, ha

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
These hoes is God's gift like Christmas
I like 'em caramel skin, long hair, thick ass
And I swear I'm feelin' all of y'all
I'm scrollin' down my call log and I'mma call all of y'all
My butter pecan Puerto Rican
She screamin' out ""papi"" every time a nigga deep in
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on
And Hilary can Rodham too, boy I gets my pimpin' on

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Mack Maine]
(And bitch I'm Mack Maine...)
Sanna Lathan, Meagan Good
Angelina Jolie (hah) D. Woods
For free suites, I'd give Paris Hilton all-nighters
In about 3 years, holla at me Miley Cyrus
I don't discriminate, no not at all
Kit-Kat a midget, if that ass soft, I'll break her off
I exchange V-cards with the retards
And get behind a Christian like Dior cause he are
Mack Mizzle... baby
Cause he are Mack Mizzle, baby

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear, I can spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say, you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working, I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til the nigga hit the jackpot

Jerrrrrk! I'm so cocky with it

Got your girl on my swag she lovin them jerkin songs
Like the new iPod just touch it, it turn her on
And when the bass start beatin and the waist I'm beatin
Done I got on my way I'm leavin
She like where you goin? I ain't got my shoes and purse
I said it's none of your concern, and she yelled ""You're a jerk!""
So I walked out the door, called Ben J
Told him it's a function he said I'm on my way
We pulled up to the party I take off my shirt and
Got geeked up, e'rybody jerkin
We was jerkin to the right, jerkin to the left
Then she popped up out of nowhere, she was still half dressed
She like f'real jerk, you lookin for this stuff
And the whole party heard her but all I could hear was

Wah, wah, wah wah wah ""You're a jerk!""

And I stay geeked up never been a retard
Got a New Boy swag and this here for y'all
So they gotta keep it separate like the Jim Crow laws
I'm a beast, I'm a king, and I guess I'm a jerk
And I go through big problems cause your boy here a flirt
Man you call me a bother wit'cha lil' jerk lines
Then you say you brought it up, but the jerk is mine
You squeezin, I'm squeezin, but your style is whack
Why you comin to the front? You can push that back
Got your girl on the side, she tossin a lil' stuff
While she textin on the phone Ben J. hit it rough
So I did it was good and I quickly got dressed
She was like where you goin? There's another girl naked
She screamed out loud Ben J. ""You're a jerk!""
And I had nothin to say but sorry that it hurts

I wonder if she know that she the center of attention
Middle of the floor, doing her, looking sexy
She can walk that walk, like the niggas do at weddings

She the type you wanna marry, top notch and classy
Niggas lined up trying to be her baby daddy
Excuse me, what's your name? How you doing? I'm just askin'
Can I take you by the hand? Baby, I'll be gladly

Damn, I want her bad, so I'mma come at her politely
By the way she flirtin', I can tell it that she like me
Way across the floor, but looking at me while she dancing
That sexy ass can be, lil' mama, you ain't understandin'

Baby girl so fine, she make a nigga wanna shout
Style so hood, I wanna see what she about

She walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk

She got Beyonce hips, Keishya Cole thighs
Meagan Good lips and some sexy-ass eyes
She yellow like the road in the Wizard of the Oz
Got them other bitches hatin', talkin' like Plies

Say it then she go fed
Then she taste up from her toes to her head
Take her out to eat before I take her to the bed
And give her that uhh, uhh and I don't need no meds

All I need is her, thirty minutes and a rubber
Nigga like me, you'll find none other
Straight beast mode, three times, one hour
Give it to her, in the kitchen, bedroom or the shower

Lil' talk, I got what she need
Head board knockin' up against her knees
Hit her from the back so I can grab her by the waist
Flip her over then you all on her face

She look good in her clothes, head to her toes
Primetime chick, she the type to get chose
Baby girl so fine, she make a nigga wanna shout
Style so hood, I wanna see what she about

She walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk

She can walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk

Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk
Walk that walk, walk that walk
Walk that, walk that, walk that walk

[Verse 1]
I like my bitches hood, but all my whips foreign
Just bought another house, the last one was borin
Ten-thousand square-feet, it feel like you tourin
You niggas dissin me, it really ain't important
Take off yo' shirt nigga, I bet yo' ribs showin
You niggas starvin, my money overflowin
Jewelry game sick; got all these hoes adorin'
Catch me in the club with all the 'gnac pourin'
If I ever go to prison, I'mma have plenty stories
Sleep real good, cause I ain't got no worries
Stay fresh everyday, jewelry stay glowin
I got plenty money and all you niggas knowin

Next month, guess what? I'm buyin rappers
I'm startin to feel sorry for you lil' bastards
I'm pretty hot, yo' career a disaster
I control you niggas, somethin like yo master
65 grand, that's 'round the bezel
Stay from 'round me if you don't like to smell cheddar
I ain't fuckin with that ho cause she a dick hiker
Wanna know who I'm fuckin, my money, I just married her
She been good to me, I might five karat her
Ran me out the sto', I bought too many plasmas
Count so much money, breathe like I got asthma
The old sayin is ""The mo' money, the merrier""

[Verse 3]
I don't know why I bought the Bentley when I had the Maserati
What I paid for the ""Goon"" chain, 140
Scared to keep money on me cause I will blow it
My strip club name is ""Mr. Will-Throw-It""
Keep fire on deck and I will show it
Fuck with me and get whacked and all you niggas know it
Scared to dance in the club cause my fire loaded
If you won't use it guess what? Then don't tote it
Mo' money to most niggas mean mo' hoeish
Mo' money to me it mean keep goin
Haters gettin tired, my money still growin
Ball all night, catch a flight in the mo'nin

(Na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye)
Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin, begin, begin

[Verse 1]
This is anti-auto-tune, death of the ringtone
This ain’t for iTunes, this ain’t for sing-alongs
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song
Wrong, this ain't politically correct
This might offend my political connects
My raps don’t have melodies
This should make niggas wan' go and commit felonies
Get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I’m so Brooklyn!
I know we facing a recession
But the music y’all making gon' make it the Great Depression
All y’all lack aggression
Put your skirt back down, grow a set men
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of auto-tune, moment of silence

[Hook]
La da da da da da
Hey hey goodbye
Hold up

[Verse 2]
This ain’t a number one record
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon
I made this just for Flex and
Mister Cee I want niggas to feel threatened
Stop your bloodclot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
You niggas' jeans too tight
You colors too bright, your voice too light (too far nigga)
I might wear black for a year straight
I might bring back Versace shades
This ain’t for Z100
Ye told me to kill y’all to keep it a hundred
This is for Hot 9-7
This shit for Clue, for Khaled we the best’n
Aww, nigga this shit violent
This is death of auto-tune, moment of silence

[Hook]
La da da da da da
Hey hey hey goodbye
Hold up
Only rappers to re-write history without a pen
No I-D on the track let the story begin, begin, begin

[Verse 3]
Hold up, this shit need a verse from Jeezy
I might send this to the mixtape Weezy
Get somebody from BMF to talk on this
Get this to a Blood, let a Crip walk on it
3 Thou' to style on this
I just don’t need nobody to smile on this
You niggas singing too much
Get back to rap, you T-Paining too much
I’m a multi-millionaire
So how is it I’m still the hardest nigga here
I don’t be in the project hallway
Talking 'bout how I be in the project all day
That sound stupid to me
If you a gangsta this is how you prove it to me
Nigga just get violent
This is death of auto-tune, moment of silence

La da da da da da
Hey hey hey goodbye

[Intro]
Ay, you know I'm lookin' for a five-star bitch talkin' bout burr
I'm talkin' homegirl be lookin' like she just stepped outta a magazine
I'm talkin' niggas I'm gonna be somethin' serious

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gotti here go twelve bars
Gucci Mane got nine cars
We don't call 'em dimes no more
'09 we call 'em five stars
I'm a five-star nigga, this a five-star clique
That's a 645, this that new M6
Pay her bills, get her hair fixed
Might even pay her rent
And the way she give it to me
Best money I ever spent
I can't even lie, I'm so super high
Do not need her, will not keep her
Unless she is fly
Gucci Mane's a thug, B; your man is a scrub, see
She loves me now, she loves you not
Yea all my bitches love me
And if you in Atlanta
Look up Gucci, girl and beep me
And we can find a five-star hotel you can meet me

[Hook]
That's a five-star chick
Now that's a five-star chick, if your credit score high
Feet and nails stay fly, keep your juice-box wet
And your head somethin' fine
You a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
It's your boy Yo Gotti, I do grade A shit
I'm the realist nigga walkin'
And this the remix and still I'm out here lookin'
For a five-star chick
When I catch her, I'mma bless her
With a five-star kid
She a natural born hustla
She ain't chasin' no suckas
On a mission for a real nigga
She ain't never fucked a busta
So your cars and your jewelry that she really don't excite
And all them hatin'-ass hoes in the club want to fight
She was born in the A, went to school in D.C
Got a job in Dallas, Texas then moved to Tennessee
If you ain't a five-star, need to go ahead and face it
Fake Gucci, fake Louis, shorty that'll make you basic

[Hook]
That's a five-star chick
Now that's a five-star chick, if your credit score high
Feet and nails stay fly, keep your juice-box wet
And your head somethin' fine
You a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick

[Verse 3: Trina]
See I'm a five-star chick
Cause I ain't that other chick
She been strugglin' for hers
From the womb I been rich
I ain't gotta talk about the money in the shoe game
All you gotta do is Google Trina
See the proof, Mane
Cause ain't none of these hoes, doing shows in a recession
They cards get declined, now they suffering a depression
While I'm spending meals, signin' all kinda deals
I'm a five-star chick, eatin' five-star meals
My whole lifestyle like Coming To America
All my Louis luggage
You see my bag, how I carry her
Walkin' through the airport
Like I'm in a parade on my hologram
Loggin' on to E-Trade

[Hook]
That's a five-star chick
Now that's a five-star chick, if your credit score high
Feet and nails stay fly, keep your juice-box wet
And your head somethin' fine
You a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I need a five-star chick
I want a five-star chick

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
I just had a epiphany, I need to go to Tiffany's
Fendi on my slippers, and my cookies always slippery
I don't need help, I pay the bills on time
So I be yellin' fuck 'em, with a dildo sign
Five, little Mama, you a three-star
I ain't sleepin' when I say I'm in my dream car
Oh, did I stutter, Harajuku hyphen
Barbie
I'm hot I think its time to put the rice in
I was in the chair, I was gluin' my weave in
When you hit the stage
They was booin' and leavin'
Young Money, red flag, no more auditions
Ask Lil' Wayne who the five-star bitch is

Slide them on in da morning

I'm Obsessed now, oh gee
Is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I put all them phone calls out
You made to my house when you was Wild'n Out before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you something to smile about
How many times you fly to my house, still trying to count
Better shut your lying mouth if you don't want Nick finding out
You probably think cause it's been so long
If I had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins
I'm mixing our studio session down
And sending it to mastering to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do
Mariah it ever occur to you
That I still have pictures
However you prefer to do
And that goes for Nick too, faggot you think I'm scurred of you
You're gonna ruin my career you better get one
Like I'mma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt
That made me put up with her psycho ass over six months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once
Yeah, what you gonna say I'm lucky
Tell the public that I was so ugly
That you fucking had to be drunk to fuck me?
Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick, Pumpkin
The second week we were dry humping, that's gotta count for something
Listen, girly, surely you don't want me to talk
About how I nutted early cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
And said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassing me I'm embarrassing you
And don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as that song's gettin' airplay I'm dissin' you
I'm a hair away from getting carried away and getting sued
I was gonna stop at sixteen, that was thirty-two
This is thirty-four bars, we ain't even third of the way through
Damn Slim, Mariah played you, Mariah who?
Oh did I say whore Nick? I meant a liar too
Like I've been going off on you all this time
For no reason
Gir,l you out your alcoholic mind
Check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fucking sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it now I'm 'bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
On an episode of Cribs, I blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go opening your jibs
Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
I ain't sayin' this shit again, ho you know what it is
It's a warning shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and I'll release every fucking thing I got
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were trying to stick two CD's in the same slot

[Interlude: Mariah Carey]
Slim Shady, artful dodger
Slim Shady, artful dodger

[Verse 2]
{I love you}
I love you, too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
Now what you say
{It's nothing}
Yeah so what I'll do is refresh your memory when you said
{I want you}
Now should I keep going or should we call truce
{You think you're cute, right?}
You bet your sweet ass I do
{I'm Mary Poppins, B}
And I'm Superman, ooh
{Mary P - Slim Shady}
Coming at you
So if you'll still be my {baby girl}
Then I'll still be your {superhero}
{Oh and Em}
Yeah, I'm right here
{You like this}
Nope, not anymore dear
It cuts like a {knife} when I tell you get a {life}
But I'm moving on with mine
Nick, cause that's your {wife}
Well tell her to shut her mouth then I'll leave her alone
If she don't {stick to the script} then I'mma just keep going
Damn

[Outro]
{I see Mary Ann, Mary Ann's saying cut the tape
Cut the tape, knife}

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl

Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours

[Bridge]
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

How low can you go? How low can you go?

[Part 1: Ludacris]
Haha, Luda!
She can go lower than I ever really thought she could Face down, ass up
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans, baby pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it, better than I've ever seen I done befo'
A lot of, women, drop it to the ground, but how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined it, not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror, now you doing it on the dance flo'
Mad 'cause I can't get with you, chick, just show me how to dance, oh
I may not wanna get low, so I'm posted up, kinda like a player do
But if you come to the crib, then I might show you girls a thang or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow
Befo' you make it big, there's just one thang that I gotta know

[Interlude: Chuck D. Sample] (4x)
How low can you go? How low can you go?

[Hook: Shawnna & (Ludacris)]
I can go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know

[Part 2: Ludacris]
I be like knick, knack, patty, wack
Oh, where my kitty cat?
Give a dog a bone
How many licks does it take 'til I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home?
I can make this show stop, soon as he hear this fo' pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A-N all the way down to yo' block
Put the needle on the record
And I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really get low, then I'ma shoot a video and put it all on TV
'Cause I like that French vanilla (French vanilla)
And the caramel (and the caramel)
But when it comes to chocolate (when it comes to chocolate)
I know that very well
Asian persuasion, no discrimination, I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butter Rican pecan peanut butter cups like Reese's Pieces
'Cause I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow
Befo' you make it big, well, there's just one thang that I gotta know

[Interlude: Chuck D. Sample] (4x)
How low can you go? How low can you go?

[Hook: Shawnna & (Ludacris)]
I can go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know

[Part 3: Ludacris]
Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it
Don't, stop – get it, get it
Put it in reverse just to back it up
Let me put some Luda in it
Show me whatchu working with, I'll show you some of this bank, roll
Yeah, you a superstar, there's just one thang I gotta know, so

[Interlude: Chuck D. Sample] (4x)
How low can you go? How low can you go?

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I fucked my money up, now I can't re-up
Ran up in his spot just to get my stacks up
Now I'm back on deck, so shawty, what the fuck you want?
Heard he's talking shit, but this ain't what the fuck you want
Locked my CEO up, now it's back to coca
Niggas talking shit, bro, hang him by a ropa
Hit em with the chopper, call that shit hot llama
Call me Waka Flocka AKA Young Wild Nigga
AKA Young Drug Dealer
Got purp, got kush, got pills, got white
In the trap all night with the hard and the soft
Stacks on the floor, watch Kebo water whipping
Shoots it to the left, then he shoots it to the right
So Icey Brick Boys got it all night
These lame-ass niggas ain't got no fight
Kick in my door, we gonna shoot it out all night
Home of the Braves, shawty, shoot 'em with AK

[Hook: Waka Flocka Flame]
Yeah! Oh let's do it

Ow, that shit hurt, so don't fuck around
But that happen often off in Riverdale, Georgia
You gonna pay the life you live off in Riverdale, Georgia
They gonna lay your ass out, rock you to sleep like a baby
Hit Squad, shawty, in the hood, we got them babies
Ever since they killed my nigga Travis
Start popping pills and acting crazy
Ever since they killed my nigga Travis
Start popping pills and acting crazy

You know me, nigga, I am the block
It's Riverdale and Waka Flock
We got the Glocks, whips and the knots
Even got the spots (Scurt! Scurt!) off the block
Catch me in different states, busting down bricks
Busting down bricks with that chick you fell in love with
We on that thug shit, give a fuck about love, I'm cruel, bitch
Keep my money on my mind, not you, bitch
Every day, shawty pull up in a new whip
In the trap, shawty said he need another one
Told them call up Waka, he said ""What the fuck you want?""
Pull up in the dunk followed by a yellow one
So Icey, Fetti Gang, pussy keep them Tommy guns

[Verse 3: Lil Capp]
Yeah, Flocka said let's do it
And this Real Money, so we getting to it
And your bitch, she choosing
But if you ain't talking dollars, keep it moving
Catch me on the south with Flocka Flame
And we got a problem if you saying Waka's name
'Cause we off the chain, you see my green flag
You want beef? Oh let's do it 'cause you ain't bad
And this music is for the drug dealers
And this music influence thug niggas
Okay, so if you get into it

Yellow Lambs, yellow MP's, yellow watch
Yellow charm ring chain, yellow living room set (Chiquita!)
Lemonade Gucci shoes for my girl, it’s Gucci

[Verse 1]
My Phantom sitting on sixes, no twenties in my denim
Your Cutlass motor knocking because it is a lemon
I like them Georgia peaches but you look more like a lemon
These sour apple bitter bitches I'm not fucking with 'em
I'm truly stupid paid, that's just how I feel today
I'm moving slow cause codeine syrup's in my lemonade
I'm standing in the shade and I'm selling lemonade
Six hundred a pint, the going rate off in the A
Lemonade diamond bracelet, put it in your face
Lemonhead diamond earrings I wore yesterday
I'm pimping wearing lemon, that's just how I'm chilling
I'm smoking grits and selling chickens, Corvette painted lemons (Gucci)

Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts

[Verse 2]
I got lemonade and lemon-tint, lemons watch me mix the shit
Lemonade-complexion East-Australian girl be killing me
She say I be killing her, I say I be feeling it
Four days then I'm sick of her cause her brain is lemonhead
Cocaine-white exterior, interior lemonade
Yellow with the off-white trimming, I call that the super drank
Yellow diamond pinky ring, call that there the lemon rock
Jewelry box a lemon bin, my ear ring size of apricot
Yeah I smoke that strong a lot, yeah I need some of what you got
Half a pound of lemon kush, call that pack the lemon drop
Canary yellow lemon watch, big bird, yellow top
Yellow Polo, Polo slippers, white and yellow Polo socks
Gucci Mane be pumping dog, he don't got all he say he got
Just stash one Lemon homie, I can supply them the fifty Glocks
Yellow boat parked at the dock, yellowbone gon' make the drop
Flip the flop, mine off the top then go buy me a yellow yacht

Yellow bricks, yellow dust, yellow ring, yellow tuss
Yellow pills, spinning wheels, yellow weed, re-up with us
Coward ass nigga, yellow stripe, you a yellowback
AK hit your dog, and you can't bring Old Yeller back
Yep Gucci bang up eighty thousand: that's a yellow safe
Yello, holmes. Mellow, holmes. You know you a scary-cat

D-D-Do you, do-do, do you think about me?
""Do you, do you, do you think about me?
Do you think, do you think, do-do-do you think about me?
Do you, do you, do you, do you think about me?

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You think about money when you think about me, huh?
It's why my ex my ex, you don't wanna be her
She used to have the Beemer, now she own a sneaker
I had her eating lobster, now she eating pizza
I think about Easter when I think about Keyshia
Shorty stay fly, that's why I keep her
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa
She good if I leave her, she got her own Visa
Think about them when you think about fronting
Think about stunting when you think about me
I'm the boss, Bentley or the Porsche?
Overseas see jet ski's slide across
I love the way you dress, now take it off
Put your legs high on my shoulders of course
I'm racing through your mind, but you already lost
I'm at the finish line and you're a friend of mine
Come on, let's ride

[Hook: Governor]
(Do you think about me?)
Just a little bit, every now and then

Goddamn girl, we used to be friends
(Do you think about me?)

Just a little bit, just a little bit
(Do you think about me?)

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I think like a hustler, I'm thinking 'bout a shipment
She thinking I'm her hustler, she thinking 'bout commitment
It's like Paul McCartney's stuck in my head
He fell in love with a bitch who walked away on one leg
She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread
That's some fucked up shit, think about that, kid
I'm thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court
I pay my child support, what the fuck she want?""
This relationship shit is too much for me
I wanna fuck, be friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow mines on shopping spree's
She should have what she want, just not from me
I'm thinking 'bout my future, she brought up my past
She don't care about me, she just want some cash
I'm thinking damn, girl, we used to be friends
How did shit become all about ends?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Governor]
Do you think about me? (Do you think about me?)
I know you think about me
You got to remember all the good times we had
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit
(Do you think about me?)
I remember when you told me
(I know you think about me)
That I'll always be special to you, darling
You were so special to me, do you think about me?

Fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club (mm-mm)
Fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah...It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

[Hook 2: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

[Verse 2]
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah.. it's whatever
You know, feeling good - living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got 10 years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

[Hook 2: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

[Hook]
I never let you down, I’ma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright?
Hard I'm gonna ball, on them squares I float
Quarter-million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may seem he might be
But no matter what they doing, they don’t do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town I’m at
In a flash like that
Recognize I'm back!
Strike a match, catch a fire

[Verse 1]
Any moment I decide that's enough of all your lies
Boy, your buzz just died
Step inside, super-fly, to the shoes in their coupe
Then exit out with all the bitches like we always do
My desire to retire grow with every new crew
Cause these guys, they don't ride like my nigga, you too
Tight jeans, funny haircuts dancing on the screen
There's a drought of real niggas in the game, so it seems
Just pretend to holla, pimping, give the shit a black eye eye
Next he say he trapping in my head I’m like: ""why?""
Be yourself; you ain't got a pimp bone in your body
I can tell you ain't never bought a key or caught a body
Nigga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane
Me and Boosie all go to prison
Now he flipping hoes, every nigga tripping
Listen dude, for you that ain't in the cards
Thank the power's in the guns
But overall it's in your heart
Nowadays I don’t know what's up with niggas in the A
Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way:
Violating. I was having conversations in the joint
But guess who done it? And I promised I would put you on point
I’m disappointed in you, dogg, you ain't hold it down at all
But I ain't going at your jaw, just going to show you how to ball
Standing tall through the storm, on the yard or in the dorms
Cats in prison who expecting me to represent for them

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Strike a match, catch a fire, see T.I. add gas
What's a Molotov cocktail that never break a glass
Still I am, partnas want to come for me you better bring it
I ain’t mad I forgive them, God I know they ain't mean it
Yeah I seen it all before, hate I'm popping and they ain't
Wrack they brain try to think how to stop it and they can’t
Ain't that lame, but then that hatred manifest to pure malice
I’m no longer being callous, I’m gonna let you niggas have it
Won’t be satisfied until somebody dies and I'm patiently waiting on
Me and the reaper on a first name basis now
I’m a let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you
But know that we could take it any place you wanna take it too
Hating in your blood, Cuz. Yes, it’s just too late for you
All I could do is pray for you or organize a wake for you
Your choice, clearly I ain't hearing your voice
Keep it up an Imma send you ass to chill wit Aunt Joyce
Hey, you can have the bottom, partner I'm up in the sky box
I got shit locked down nigga why stop now
I'm so above you, hover over suckers why drop down
I’m so profound, it goes down, and I never let you down

Little white T, some boobs, and bamboo
White girls tell me ""Hey Nicki, your camp rules
Is that why you get more head than shampoos?""

She winked her eye at me and said, ""It's time to have some fun""
I told her, ""Go shorty, shorty, go shorty, shorty, go

[Verse 1: Strap]
Hopped off the stage, walked through the crowd
Drunker than a white boy, blowing on that loud
Shawty said something, but the music was too loud
I told her, ""Come here, girl, get out this crowd""
And uhh, ""Bring your team, come fuck with my team
Tell the waitress four bottles of Goose and 30 wings""
And now she all up on me, whispering these dirty things
Want me to make her sing just like the birdy sings
Lip ring, tongue ring, girl, you a freak
Winked her eye at me and said, ""Bring Quez and Li""
Okay cool, shawty, we gon' party 'round three
And now I got her whole team screaming, ""Travvy!""

I told her that I want her, then I asked her, ""Can I have her?""

I know I seen you, shorty, shorty, in this club before
I was walking 'round the club 'cause I ain't have nothing to do
I tapped her on the shoulder and said, ""Girl, I like them Trues""
She was dancing like she worked at Magic City
Said her name was Tasha and her homegirl's name was Brittany

[Verse 1: Smoove]
They be like, Smoove, can you teach me how to Dougie
You know why
Cause all the bitches love me
All I need is a beat that's super-bumpin'
And for you, you, and you to back it up and dump it
Put your arms out front, lean side-to-side
They gonna be on you when they see you hit that Dougie, right
Ain't nobody fuckin' with my bro from Morningside
He go by Bubba and he hit that dance like thunder
I ain't from Dallas but I D-Town boogie
I show my moves off now everybody tryna to do me
I leave the functions and all the ladies tryna to screw me
Now you just do you and I'mma do me
Niggas love to hate so they try to screw me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they try to glue me
I make the party shine bright when it started boomin'
This beat was bubblegum, so I had to chew it

[Hook]
Teach me how to Dougie, teach me-teach me how to Dougie
All my bitches love me, all my-all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me, you ain't fuckin' with my Dougie

[Verse 2: Yung]
The name is Yung for them dudes who don't know me
I know I'm from the West but I can teach you how to Dougie
I step up in the club and all these bitches bug me
On a nigga dancin' and none of them know me
I hear this crowd screamin' like, aye get it Brodie
So I'm move my shoulders and I take it real low
They like, how he do that
He can Dougie on the flow
And when that nigga stop they like, Dougie some mo
I'm like, a nigga kinda tired then I pass it to the bro
M-Bone, show these cats how to do that
Down South dance that we learned a lil' too fast
And brought it to the hood and, got the whole crew cash

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Are]
Back of the party, I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryin' to get bent and meet a thick redbone
She do her Dougie and all them bitches hatin'
But I'm about to escape with a bitch and head home
She got her friend so it's a two man and
I run it, run it even if her legs long
She like, you hubby
I think she love me
But I change the subject and I do my Dougie
Cause I don't give a fuck, blow trees, get money
Me, Smoove, Heff in the back with Playboy bunnies
We gonna make em do the Dougie in the middle of the bed
And when I asked for some head the bitch looked at me funny
Duh, bitch you can't tell me nothin'
Starr made the beat, I just took it out the oven
I just see the Dougie when everybody clubbin'
And I hate skinny jeans cause the burner keep rubbin'

[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out
Just follow me, I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'ma do something, I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him ""why?"" or ""how can he""
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album
He's still shittin', whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas; his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

[Hook]
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playing with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your feelings
Instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was “ehhhh”
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
‘Cause I ain't playing around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now

[Hook]
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I have been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees
With no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof
Like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
‘Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
‘Cause I'm raising the bar, I'd shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing, and I'm…

[Hook]
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree

Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly

I’m living in that 21st Century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I’m tripping off the power
(21st-Century schizoid man)
The system broken, the school is closed, the prison's open
We ain’t got nothing to lose, motherfucker we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I’ll see you in the morning
Huh? I’ll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my asshole
I’m an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
And I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows, he’s so fucking gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn’t open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I’m fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond encrusted piece
Thinking

At the end of the day, god damn it I’m killing this shit
I know damn well y’all feeling this shit
I don’t need your pussy, bitch, I’m on my own dick
I ain’t gotta power trip, who you going home with?
How Ye doing? I’m surviving
I was drinking earlier, now I’m driving
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hiding?
I got the power to make your life so exciting

[Outro: Kanye West & Dwele]
Now this will be a beautiful death
I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go
I’m letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go
I’m letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
I’m jumping out the window, I’m letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

Waka Flocka Flame, one hood-ass nigga
Riding real slow, bending corners, my nigga

Got a main bitch, got a mistress (what else?)
A couple girlfriends, I'm so hood rich
Keep my dick hard and keep me smoking
You'll get bills free, shawty, no joking
And what I stand for? Brick Squad
I'ma die for this shawty, man, I swear to God
In the trap with some killers and some hood niggas
Where you at? Where you trap? You ain't hood, nigga

Nigga with a attitude like Eaze and Cube
When my little brother died, I said: ""Fuck school!""
I picked the burner up, then I grabbed some marijuana
Two years later, screaming: ""Now I'm here, your honor!""
Glock 9, the SK, if you want to beef
Shawty, point blank range, I'll put your ass to sleep
Shawty, talk is cheap so watch what your say
Broad day in the air like this shit legal
Desert Eagle gold and back, that's the key, pull trigger

Camo shorts and Bubba Kush
We can talk she'd rather fuss
This and that 'bout such and such

Yeah, now she hear I'm with them other bitches
Yeah, I told her mind her fucking business
Shit she probably out here fucking niggas

Now somebody tell them hoes, I'm single for the night

[Hook]
Yeah, I'm single

And I'm single, tonight I'm single
And I ain't tripping on nothing, I'm sipping on something
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

[Verse 2]
Dreads braided to the back
I'm chilling but my swag on full attack
And my girl acting like a brat
So when she call, I don't answer I just write her back
She hate it when I do that shit
And when I get home she go through my shit
She call numbers back to see who that is
Man I hate it when she do that shit
Polo t-shirt, Polo drawers
Now make me take this Polo off
Girl you can get broken off
Yeah, I fuck you for an hour than I smoke it off
Swimming trunks and bathing suits
Then go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth
Don't wanna fuss, ain't tryna fight

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now she got on a fuck 'em dress
And I got on my double-breast
And he been fussing all day with her

She wanna be Weezy F Baby-sitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it with her
I say hold up
She say she just playing
Then I falls in that pussy like quick sand
Hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hanging like a clothes line
I cut my phones off, both lines
It's about to get nasty, pork rinds
She came hard, both times
We both say we single, and we both lying
We both wrong, but it feel right
Put your hands up if you single for the night

Big block gators, fresh pair of Marcs
599, brand new Ferrari
Remix, yeah nigga get it
Million dollar nigga, money be my best friend
Yo Gotti!

[Verse 4: Bun B]
I got my city on my back, my diamonds on my front
Conjure up in my cup, granddaddy in my blunt
Did it 2000 and whatever, the year is after this is
Cadillac shoes and the jazzy yellow misses
Wanna blow me kisses, right around the zipper
Down and drop it to the flo’ and I ain’t even gotta tip her
R.I.P. to Jack Tripper, two up in the crib
They say they wanna have my babies then they better get a bib
Here they come

[Verse 5: Diamond]
I came in as a rookie with my pockets on fat
Got a million dollar pussy, bitch, my cat got stacks
Uhh, n-n-n-now that a boss bitch move
If you go against the boss but the boss never loses
Got a house on the water so I can feed the gators
Rasberry Porsche, 32 flavors
My bread so swoll, I can’t fit it in my wallet
My pockets on big, Christopher Wallace

[Verse 6: Shawty Lo]
Do it shawty, let me say
Shawty Lo do it B.I.G
I like a lot of hoes and I love the freaks

You ain’t got enough paper
Middle finger to a hater
You remember me? Big Uf
Purp in mine, what’s in yo cup?

[Hook]

[Verse 7: Wiz Khalifa]
I post up, time to roll up
Give the hoes what they need, give the people what they want
Uhh, I don’t fuck with no blunts

With a bad bitch, light brown skin thick ass
Never slow, I get mine quick fast
Gettin’ money in this bitch ass

[Verse 8: Maino]
Standin’ on the couch in club with a pocket full of c-notes
Niggas can’t tell me I ain’t bigger then Nino
Hop up in the Coupe, give it gas I’m floatin’
Money getting’ big like the arms on Hulk Hogan
Stacks on top of stacks, baby this is IHOP
I be runnin’ down on sacks, auto I shop
Everything is big, big chain keep a big chrome
Big house big truck, big body red bone

[Hook]

Uhh, uhh, uhh

Thinkin 'bout us, where we gon' be?
Opened my eyes, yeah
It was only just a dream
So I travel back, down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah
It was only just a dream

[Verse 1]
I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot, now she found her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it
Knowin somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby I can't think
I shoulda put it down, shoulda got that ring
Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My lover, my life
My shorty, my wife
She left me, I'm tight
Cause I knew that it just ain't right

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
When I be ridin man I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryin to get my Usher on but I can't let it +Burn+
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn - for
My woman, oh I miss her, when will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinkin all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm goin through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missin, wishin she pick up the phone
But she made a decision that she wanted to move on
Cause I was wrong

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you wishin you could give them everything
Everything (heyyy)
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you wishin you could give them everything

[Nicki Minaj]
You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin, you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice, I always hated
But lookin back, it made me greater
You always told me, forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it, down to a science
Why am I tryin'? No you ain't buyin
I tried to fight it, back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin' at you, and gettin' at you
Pickin up dishes, throwin' them at you
Why are you speakin', when no one asked you?

Cause you say ""Nicki,"" and I say ""Who me?""
And you say ""No you,"" and I say ""Screw you""
Then you start dressin', and you start leavin'
And I start cryin', and I start screamin'
The heavy breathin', but what's the reason?
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin - yo!
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin', passive aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay you're right, just let it go
Okay you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw to a goal

No love for 'em, nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start

[Hook]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screaming: ""That's nothin'!""
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Verse 2]
Got a call from my jeweler, this just in
And bitches love me ‘cause I'm fucking with their best friends
Not a lesbian, but she a freak though
This ain't for one night, I’m shining all week, ho
I’m sippin' Clicquot and rocking yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in my watch I can’t tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up, ‘cause every nigga that I’m with Taylor'd

[Hook]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screaming: ""That's nothin'!""
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Verse 3]
Stay high like how I’m supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds can’t get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean, but it's super mean
She wanna fuck with them cats, smoke weed, count stacks
Get fly and take trips and that's that, real rap
I let her get high if she want and she feel that
Convertible drop feel, ‘87, the top peeled back

[Interlude]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
You already know what it is, man
And if you don't, you should by now
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Hook]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screaming: ""That's nothin'!""

Making love to the money I swear the sex great
Kick them hoes out but let the money stay

Making love to money on the interstate
Can't keep my hands off her, we on a dinner date
I'm making love to my money shawty keep me straight
I can't live without her, I fuck her everyday

[Verse 1]
Shawty stayed by my side when I started grinding
She the main reason why a nigga shining
Strippers can't see me all this money flying
30 years old, talking bout retiring
I'm a show these hoes who the King of Shine is
Soon as I walk in the king of diamonds
She broke up with me once almost had me crying
She know I was cheating cause she caught me lying
King of the jungle I'm a lion
White lion in the house we named it Miley Cyrus
She never talk back baby very private
Got me talking shit but she kinda quiet

[Hook]
Making love to the money I swear the sex great

I'm making love to my money shawty keep me straight

[Verse 2]
I gotta take her everywhere cause these niggas crazy
Only leave her by herself on special occasions
I love making love cause she so amazing
When I bring her to the club them hoes be going crazy
Every nigga in the hood wanna fuck my lady
Can't wait for me to slip so they can take my baby
She gets me outta jams and tight situations
Love ain't got no gun at point ain't no limitation
She got me in that thang sittinh on them thangs
Distracted now all them hoes don't look at me the same
Well fuck it they ain't gotta fuck with me at all
I pick my baby up and took her to the mall

[Hook]
Making love to the money I swear the sex great

[Verse 3]
Now baby ain't no angel but she a keeper
Before she dealt with me she dealt with some real evil people
She bought me AK's call it Desert Eagles
Cocaine, heroin, pills, meth and stupid regal
I took her from her ex yeah she caught him cheating
The very next day she left we started beefing
And she don't never lie to me she keep it real
Yo bitch keep coming short my bitch keep wearing heels
She keep on standing tall she never stand me up
She'll go to war with anybody she don't give a fuck
She help me keep it on the road like a hub cap
So I keep her on my mind like a skull cap (Gucci)

Ain't gon stress you, but ima let you know

You be killin em
Girl you be killin em
You be killin em
Girl you be killin em

[Verse 1:]
You ain't gotta worry bout her, shorty straight
Been chasing her for 2 days, first 48
A bad bitch cost, she worth every cent
She look like the best money that I ever spent
Just watching my cutiepie get beautified
Make me want better jewels, a newer ride
Louboutin shoes, she got too much pride
Her feet are killing her, I call it shoe-icide
Looking good has it's sacrifices
Chilly weather bring four figure jacket prices
Her body nice, face dime
Give you that iPhone 4, face time
Shorty in the streets, still handle the home
Enough class for wine, still handle Patron
When them other hoes call I hand her the phone
And she hand em the tone

[Hook]
[You what's up girl, ain't gotta ask it]

[Verse 2:]
Yeah I know that's what they all says
She got a donkey with her, Juan Valdez
Keep it clean cut like bald heads
Been playin with that green long as Paul Pierce
So you gotta ball harder than them ball players
All she wanna know is there a mall near us
Can't fault her, the last nigga spoiled her
But he ain't beat it up, I assault her
Shoulda seen her come to me when I called her
Slow strut like she walking to the altar
Hand bag on her arm cost four bills
And she ain't gotta beg, borrow or steal
Often imitated, never duplicated
They say she a dime, I say she underrated
I just met her so the next solution
Dead my old chick, execution

[Hook]
[You what's up girl, ain't gotta ask it]

Had to let you know
All the ladies (to all the ladies)
I'd like to congratulate you
Congratulations

And you just came from the gym clothes
In a fitted cap and some Timbo's
And a pair of flats, well trimmed toes
Camera in the mirror, BBM Pose
Still killin em hoes
You still killin em hoes
You still killin em hoes

I wake up early in the morning 'round the crack of dawning

And I’m all tatted up, dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
Because I got my speakers going hammer, bammer-bammer-bammer

[Verse 1]
My speakers out of space like ET
Cops watch me all day like TV
SOD hit the club, we be so deep
Mayne I'm deep in the game I grind like a OG
I got 12 diamond chains like a OZ
Follow me like the Wizard of Oz
Girls love my style cause it is so neat
Ask about me in the streets I spit so heat
Ain’t nobody in the game messing with my click
Style swift hot like it’s July 10th
Fly chick in my whip with nice tits
Her boyfriend paid for it, I didn’t
Ice game, cold as a polar bear
Sun hit my chain, watch it make a solar flare
We gettin' money over here hands in the air
Y'all making it too easy, it’s not fair

Say you ball harder then me, man get 'em outta here

Two door coupe, girl in bikini
Passenger seat and she five star she so swag
She so Fabolous, they way she throw it in the bag
Its young soulja soulja mayne I swear I’m popping tags
Back then, you could catch me in a Pontiac
These days drop top Phantom with a 100 stacks
Yeah they buy this album but they want they money back
Girls wet like they living in a fish tank
I’m getting money man what the fuck a bitch think

Like Rick Ross bitch I think I’m MC Hammer

Something wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I’m heading home, I’m almost there
I’m on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university

[Pre-Hook: Kanye West]

Restraining order, can’t see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I’ll be more supportive

Courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby please
Can’t let her grow up in that ghetto university

Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back
They be lying through they teeth
Hope you slip up off your path
I don’t switch up, I just laugh, put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats, then get busy on they ass
See, that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glitterin’ may not be gold, don’t let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Go in and put your hands up, when times is hard you stand up

Two in the air for the father that’s there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that don’t wanna be there
None for the niggas tryna hold them back
Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that’s living in the ghetto
That the niggas holding back, that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I’m on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys I’m rapping round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti, then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy, tell ‘em look at me, boy
I hope your son don’t have a gun and never be a d-boy

So no matter what you been through, no matter what you into
No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down, you just lift your arms higher
Raise ‘em till your arms tired, let ‘em know you here
That you struggling, surviving, that you gon’ persevere
Yeah, ain’t nobody leaving, nobody going home
Even if they turn the lights out, the show is going on

Cut the music up
A little louder..

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
When you was just a young’un your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly its like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
See You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck
Couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin
You see a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck
Couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck
Couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck
Couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together

Why you worried 'bout mine, hoe?

Crows start flockin'

Knockin' pictures off the wall
We sit tall, we still crawl

[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up
Well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, ‘cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well
That you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it, please don't do it
‘Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it

Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says they miss the old Drake, girl, don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap opera rappers
All these niggas sound like ""All My Children""
And that's who you thinkin' is about to come and make a killin'
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
‘Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I ain't even gotta say it, they know

Rather hear how you got it over, how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin' yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family and struggle and it takin' forever
About hearts that you’ve broken and ties that you’ve severed
No doubt in my mind, that’ll make them feel better

[Intro]
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever? (oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit and run?
(I wanna see you work out for me, work out for me)

[Hook]
Ay, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’mma see you again
But is that a good thing?
Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hope it never would end
Like, ""is it the real thing
Or is it just a one night stand?""
Well then

[Bridge (x2)]
Let me see you get
High then go low
Now, girl won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 1]
She like them boys with the big old chains
Ride around town in the big old Range
I knew her when I rocked big old jeans
Now the little nigga doing big old thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: ""baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there""
And I brag hardly but just to show up at this party
I made what your nigga make in one year, that's unfair, but
So is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

[Hook]
Ay, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’mma see you again
But is that a good thing?
Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain

Like, ""is it the real thing

I wanna see you (work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 2]
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block, damn, girl you're mean
They be starting shit, but it’s your world
On my Martin shit: ""You go, girl!""
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort? Cause just like them 2-door Fords
Damn, they don’t make them like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool, me? I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind, trying to see what's on yours
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass
Get right, get right

[Hook]
Ay, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’mma see you again
But is that a good thing?

Straight up, now tell me
Do you really want to love me forever? (oh oh oh)

Straight up, now tell me

I take over the streets, fresh off the banana boat
I come straight from the east, where niggas split your cantaloupe
You tell me where you wanna meet, I’m coming with a gang of dope
My cigar full of loud, I'm laced up to the fucking fo’
A Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911
I do the whole dash, dropping all cash (woah)
Gutter to the death of me, I'm sticking to the recipe
Plugged in with Colombians, I know Sosa
All I got is my balls and my word, fuck the roaches
Everything we do, we put Versace on the sofas
The money got me geeked like I took a hit of coca
My life is a movie, I gotta stay focused

Used to stay up at The Twelve, now your worth like 12 million
Boy you did, boy you did it, you did the unexpected
I say fuck the unexpected, I just did what I projected
I swear young women are lost these days while older women dig me
Fucking women that knew Biggie so it really ain't no biggie
It’s just OVO and XO, and freebandz the committee

Ain’t nothing about me ordinary, I come with the yayo
I move like a mob boss, it’s gonna take an army
The world is mine, nigga, you get it if you want it
You fuckin with me, you’ll move to Alaska by the morning
You want me to be the bad guy? Okay, it's on then

My diamonds talk for me, they say ""Hi, can I meet you?""

[Verse 1]
I got Versace all on my back
These hoes all on my back
Plus these plugs all on my back
Cause they know I'm moving that pack
These Louies all in my face
Four-fifths stay up on my waist
Plus it ain't on me for nothing so please don't make me catch a case
Cause bitch I'm 'bout it
Me walking round with no check on me, psshh
Yeah I doubt it
Your girl ain't finna leave with me, psshh
Yeah, I doubt it
And I'm like, ""What the hell they talking 'bout?""
And if I got it I bought it, cause boy, you know I'm cashing out

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
OK, I drop the top: hop in
Hoes they coming by flocks in
Birds they coming by flocks in
Pass them birds like Stockton
Play with my money I'm popping
No acting, but it's a movie
Got Spinz on the beat so we ain't losing
Don't act like your ho ain't choosin
I done blowed up, yeah I'm the bomb
Riding round blowing on stank bombs
Pussy so good you should thank moms
Top-floor suite chilling at the Palms
We want the whole loaf, leave y'all the crumbs
Till then I'm running my check up
And it's fuck a Bugatti, I'm calling my jet up

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's big pimping over here... Church
Time to cop the Maybach, already had the vert
I got big money visions, Sammy Sosa pigeons
What that mean? That mean they jumping out the kitchen
And I'm on the money mission, nobody can stop me
Just grab your camcorder, press record and go on and watch me
And you can skate on my ice just like you playing hockey
And in the booth I beat the beat up, call me Rocky
Yeah I'm cocky

[Verse 1]
Drinking a German beer with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite, cause she admires the art
Of Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect
So smile, and pack your bags real good, baby
Cause you'll be gone for a while

[Hook]
Girl tell me how you feel, what your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life
Soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

La la la la la la la la la
You never had it so good
La la la la la la la la la
You never had it so good

[Verse 2]
Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy, and maybe see the Colosseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa
Now smile, and pack your bags real good, baby
Cause you'll be gone for a while

La la la la la la la la la la
You never had it so good
La la la la la la la la la la

[Verse 3]
Well I been feeling singular, how about let's make it plural
Spin the globe, whatever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we’re Barcelona bound
Smile, and pack your bags real good, baby
Cause you'll be gone for a while

[Hook]
Girl tell me how you feel, what your fantasy oh

Gucci made in Italy, Bally belt I'm killing shit
The way I'm rocking Jimmy Choo, the word got out I'm dealing it
I fuck her she a immigrant, don't touch her she ain't got benefits
Bussing down them Benjamins, fuck it up on Louis kicks
That's the way I'm kicking it, Ferragamo cover me
Puerto Rican, Japanese, we laid up at the DoubleTree
Yellow ice a bumble bee, pinky ring a quarter key
I-phone a metro twerking off the whole thing
My earring a jelly bean, gangster lean and Irene
Red eyes no visine, I'm loc'd out on the drink
Horse shoes on my jeans, Robin jeans with the wings

I'm in Phipps with the set going crazy
Got some diamonds round my neck no fugazi
Bad bitches in the suite, tryna to bait me
Just a young hood nigga, streets raised me
Working with a unit, tryna stretch it to another one
Drinking on that actavis, then it tasting like some bubble gum
Thumbing through the check, boarding on a jet
Talking on the iPhone, sipping out the styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown
VVS and white stones, VVS and white stones

Free Bandz on Al Capone (Straight up)

Give me apartment and some water and I can swim
Got that Gambino jumping out the gym
My young nigga serving J's outside crim
Jumping cross me you know your chances slim
In my aviator Gucci like I'm driving planes
When the cash hit cash money smell like cocaine
Doing Birdman numbers making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler jumping bail on your ring
Spent so much on Louie gave me free champagne
In Bal Harbour shopping and they doing the same thing
And I keep my cup with me like a pimp
I think I'm Magic Don Juan take a glimpse
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film

Them niggas stole my swag but I don't want it back

You see it in my closet before it's on the rack
Was out there in Hawaii, now I'm goin back
My nigga uh! I got so much money I should start a bank
So much paper right in front of me it's hard to think
Buy so many bottles it's gon' be hard to drink

I pass through, fresh to death
You've now entered swag school

Ladies holding kisses
Swag as cold as sickness
Teen Driicky tatted on 'em 'cause their asses so ridiculous
In the 'Mazzi, paparazzi

Man they can't control the pictures
M.O.B. tat, screaming money over bitches
My clothes and tatts they're all custom though
Something that you ain't accustom to

Don't collapse with the Huxtables
Hoes like hats they adjustable
This is for my ladies and my fellas getting gravy
But your body's marked up, like the train back in the 80s

I've been through the test
Now, ink on my chest
Trying to triple my chest

Buy you a Mitchell & Ness

Clack clack and snatch jewels
Pack tools, crap shoot
And sell crack in glass tubes

Our chicks? Attitude
Hard enough to get at a dude
Tatted up, fattest butt
Suck it off, vacuum

Trips to Miami, Inc
After that, Lowrider
When I say we're balling trick
I don't mean no Globetrotter

Driicky is a monster, ain't a heir up in his safe
Since I murder raps, I should tat a tear up on my face
Can't you hear this flow? It's evil
Can't be near us close to lethal

Y'all are weird
Yo I'm just here to spit 'bout piercings, clothes, and needles
Grab some cheer up for the people
Rappers fear 'cause most

I don't have to smoke I rap the dope considered so illegal
To all my G's up, can I just get a witness
If you're inked up, throw your feet up
Or you're stylin' in a Mitch-Ness

Ain't leaving out my females

Show 'em all

[Intro]
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er

[Verse 1]
Is that her in the VIP-line
With the Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive a Nissan now she in a Beamer
I don’t want ‘er cause she from the corner
And I heard that Beamer was a loaner
Her old man, the owner
And don't even drink Carona's
What type of drink you want bruh
On champagne forever
On dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me
If you’d like to change the weather
If you wanna live better
We can buy a crib, where ever
Don’t get too thirsty, get used to the cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see ‘er ‘fore I do tell ‘er I wish that I’ve met ‘er

[Hook]
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain’t gon cheat and she gon never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need ‘er, she come through
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er

[Verse 2]
Send ‘er my way
Tell ‘er I’ve been lookin’ for ‘er in the broad day
Hangin’ with the dope boys in the hallways
And I know, to keep ‘er, yeah you gotta get that pay
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er too
I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion
I heard that she a precious jewel, you treat her to medallions
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to prowlin
And if I get her number, you know I can’t wait to dial it
And if we get together, girl, you know we gon be wildin
And when we get together we make magic and it’s ours
Whenever you up here, ain't nun nobody can do about it

[Hook]
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain’t gon cheat and she gon never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need ‘er, she come through
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er

[Verse 3]
She a hood girl
But she a good girl
She been mislead
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
I’ve tried to go to sleep
And seen ‘er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today I'mma stay clean
Just in case you recognize her face, send ‘er to me
And tell ‘er I’ve been lookin’ for ‘er with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin because I got my cash right
And tell ‘er if she honest I promise to stay true
Make sure, when you tell ‘er, tell ‘er we goin past the moon

[Hook]
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain’t gon cheat and she gon never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need ‘er, she come through
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er

[Verse 1]
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Hook]
Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Verse 2: Kendrick & his conscience]
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

[Hook]
Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch

(Sherane)
Aw man... where is she taking me...
Where is she taking me...

[Verse 3]
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me,  making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough

[Skit]
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight man, that nigga ain't tripping
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'ma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ----'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, aye I see somebody
(Car door opens and gunshots are fired)
Aha! Got them niggas, K-dot, you good?
L----, you good?
Yeah blood, I'm good, Dave, you good?
Dave? Dave, say something - Dave?
These bitch ass niggas killed my brother!

I gotta grind, won't stop, hustle won't quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle, super bad bitch
If I want it, bet I got it
If I don't then all I gotta do is
Go, Get It - stay about my business
Ball til I fall, floss until I'm finished
I just Go, Get It - Stay about my business
I'm living just to kill it, stacking millions to the ceiling

[Verse 1]
Everyday above ground, all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all
Louis down to the drawers, Louis Vuitton kicks
Got a Mad Hatter swagger, bitch I’m stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and they're stupid dumb thick
I’m the marathon man, all I do is run shit
A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official
Multimillion dollar shit, money is the object
Hot shit, bitch, I got a sauna on my arm
Six figure with no diamond, Richard Mille and Vacheron
They just talk about they got it
I’m the upper echelon, though
Bitch I‘m 'bout that action, you could go on with that convo
I have done more than you dream 'bout
Got your dream bitch and your dream house
On lean passing them beans out
With a bad crew, the whole team high
Go on boy, get seen by, bro you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough, that’s all I see
I g.o.g.e.t.i.t

[Verse 2]
I live life, fuck late night
Get shitfaced when I take flight
I get paid, no sick days
My outfit’s on switch blade
Don’t sniff yay, but I blow dro
Bank roll on loco
Still ride with that 4-4
Don’t let my P-O know
Bad white bitch super thick
I’m Ice T, she Coco
She got another bitch, other bitches
Her ass fat, face so-so, no paper trail
No phone call, no emails, no photos
Just backshot, with that fat butt
And low blow headbutts in slow-mo
Purple label, Polo and Akoo, that’s all I do
Man I Striver Row my denim in my new Margiela shoes
Man, we be cool if we just parle, on Margharita Molly
And the strongest pack around bumpin' Sade out in Maui (?)
We menagin’ for a hobby
We kick it how we kick it
Know you envy how I’m living
Chicks just can’t resist this pimping
Get the million bout my business

Gave her the wrong number and a bad addy
You ain't going nowhere like a bad navi

I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Bridge]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Bridge]
I can feel the changes

Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Intro: Big Sean]
God, oh, God
I've been working all god damn year, I just got my check
I'm 'bout to spend it all on me, I'm worth it

[Bridge: Big Sean (Kanye West)]
Hol' up, tell me what you see
Pull up, watch these motherfuckers freak
Why don't ya say waddup though when you see me in the streets
(G.O.O.D. Music in this bitch now drop that motherfuckin beat)

[Hook: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Okay, this to all of my enemies that seeing me gettin' guap right now
Seeing me gettin' guap right now, seeing me gettin' guap right now
This to all of my hatin' hoes that seeing me gettin' guap right now
Seeing me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
This to all my old hoes that seeing me gettin' guap right now
Seeing me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, I won't stop right now
Seeing me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, I won't stop right now
Hell nah, I won't stop right now, seeing me gettin' guap right now

[Verse 1]
Okay, I need 50k large (right now)
My momma need a new crib (right now)
My daddy need a new car (right now)
So I be goin' so hard (right now)
Detroit is my yard (right now)
I need a 17 car garage (right now)
I need a 17 broad menage (right now)
I need a jail house to free my dogs (right now)
I done paid taxes, paid dues, paid bills my whole life
So I'mma throw money in the air, like I'm tryin' to pay the sky
Told myself that man if I can't live like this, I'd rather die
I give it up to God, and he always replies:
""Control yo' hoes, you let her talk till you crazy
You got baby mama drama, you ain't even got you no baby!
You fugazi, b-boss up, boss up with your time dog
You ain't got time for no hoes, I ain't even got time for no time off!""
I'm on

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Okay, I need 50k large (right now)
My homie just beat the charge (right now)
My brother need a new job (right now)
So I be goin' so hard (right now)
I need my face on a black card (right now)
My iPhone need a charge (right now)
My fish tank need sharks (right now)
I need a blimp to say the worlds ours (right now)
So these niggas can know I do what they can't
I'm stuntin' for all the people who ain't
You still hatin'? You should be fuckin' ashamed
Far as I came, guess when you're running the game they want you to sprain
Yeah, I know, but I don't get my stress on
Takin' shots, swear it's like my stomachs made of Teflon
They like, ""Boy, won't you get your rest on?""
Bitch, cause I'm up for every hour I was slept on
And last night I dreamed about two girls, bisexual
They was tryin' things, trisexual
Then I woke up in a city where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated, F.F. affiliated
Millions chasin' go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Chandon sippin', never had a palm readin'
Always had my palms itchin' time to get it
Boy, I was taught to get it till it's gone
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I don't

[Bridge] + [Hook]

[Outro]
Right now, whoa (x6)
This to all my enemies that see me gettin' guap right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell yeah, won't stop right now
See me gettin' guap right now, hell nah, won't stop right now
Hell nah, won't stop right now, see me gettin' guap right now

[Verse 1]
They'll never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
Cause your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple
My career's been the pinkprint
When I retire, tell 'em think pink
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophecy every thing I do?
But before I continue let me thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came
Tezz and EI told me it wouldn't be in vain
Cause prior to me signing I could've went insane
And even now I think, ""Do I really want this fame?""
Let me get up and go, 700 to go overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show
Man, I'm birthing these artists and I'm starting to show

[Hook x2]
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

[Verse 2]
Who I wanna work with? Nobody! 99% of them is nobody
Bitches acting like they killing shit, OK
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend they last dime to say the copped the soonest
Why these niggas going broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them Ramen Noodles
B-B-B-bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol
Pink Friday in Macy's, thongs and some pasties
(Yo, what other female rapper perfume in here? Cause I must've missed it)
12 milli to kick my feet up, get ready this is the Re-up

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize? I just have to decide
What you hiding from? What you hiding from?
Hiding baby

Would you, would you, give your
Would you, would you, give your
Would you, would you, give your all for yours

I could tell you was into me from our instant chemistry

You reminisce every session, know you’ll come back again
I know you can’t breath without me, you gon' need your oxygen
I damn near gave you a overdose on my own medicine
I took a sip of your tea and I ain’t been right ever since
As I think to myself what’d it be is it heaven sent
Let’s put the past behind us
And go far away where nobody can find us

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You could leave today I bet you’ll come back tomorrow
I could see the hate is comin’ from a mile up
And it’s only preparin’ us for what we got comin’
If I did come your way and you feel like runnin’
Run in my direction and don’t you run from me
Cause any time we get together, we goin’ stuntin’
And I’m applyin’ major pressure, feel it in your stomach
It’s lightnin', it’s thunderin', you describin', got me wonderin'
Butterfly, butterfly
Will you gon ever leave?
Any time you leave my side
I know you comin’ back
I know you comin’ back to me

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Is there anything you wanna know?
Is there any place you rather be?
You walk until your feet get sore
I bet you walking back
And I bet you walking back to me
Actually that’s a guarantee
My friendship a guarantee
You got my ego in another league
I ain’t tryna be cocky
I got your heart in my pocket

You love that little bit of new, now throwback
Cleveland City snakeskin snapback
Niggas know the uniform, keep the brim low
You doubt him, don't know a damn thing about him
What is hip hop without him, y'all niggas just really don't know
Go, all day every day, hold on with all might
I gave the world my heart and they gave the kids insight
Yup now fuck you I ain't left
I'm outta my mind like all the time
And a nigga ain't missed one step (yet, yup)

My head hurt, gotta give me something that'll make me feel good
I remember couldn't tell a nigga nothing, man I wish you would
Niggas ain't working, like me I had to put my bid in
All this rose gold I'm dipped in
Juste un clou, while I coast through clouds
That's my life babe, crystal clear, no cascade
I'm going, going I'm on a crusade
To save the kids from the weak shit
It's finally gonna be my world
Here all the girls can be my girls
Just sit back count stacks girl
Hold a nigga down all the time girl

I thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding hide yo kittens, hit yo children with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hard headed, never listen
Purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians, the land of no religion
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my benjis and my Bentley, and them bitches now I gets gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

Who said you can’t live forever lied
Of course, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll live long
You can’t ever deny
My force, I’m living forever I’ll
Forever, I’ll LIVE

[Verse 2]
Riding through your city like that motherfucka mine
Or choking on that semi, rob a motherfucka blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind niggas talking down
Never talk to cops, make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back I'm talking 'bout your mom
Cause there's killers in my town, making hits, sniffing lines
Out committing crimes, wait for shit to simmer down
Corrupted little minds, 8 and 9, finna shine
On the grind, do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya
Where they shoot without a purpose, services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it, can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous, who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa & 2 Chainz]
It's Young Khalifa, man
2 Chainz!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, We gettin paid so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cooking like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissing my girl with both eyes closed
Perfecting my passion, thanks for asking
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me, now I'm

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And the same ones that I ride with
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with
If you looking for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or in the crown with
My new broad, thats a fine chick
And the wonder squad, I'm down with
Ain't no way around it
What you say, tell me what you say
Working hard, reppin for my dogs, do this every day
Takin' off, looking out for all, makin sure we ball
Like the mob all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me, now I'm

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
(I ride or die for love)
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin like a killer inside
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin off set
I look better on your girl than her outfit

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin out on anybody who try to say some one thing about it
Got a problem, I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plently clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars dont even lose control

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes
I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Outro: 2 Chainz]
I ride or die for mine
I’m ride or die material
Only one life to live, so here we go
(This moment, we own it)

[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
I gotta close the window before I record
‘Cause New York don't know how to be quiet
Stand up!

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Coogi down to the socks, like I'm Biggie poppa
Keep your girl head in my Tommy boxers
But really though, she a silly ho
‘Cause you know the Fergenstein getting plenty dough
She don't get nothin' from a nigga though
All she get is hard dick and some Cheerios
Kinda silly though, but I'm lyrical
Bet I put him in the dirt with the penny loafs
No tint though, on my window
So you see a nigga shining in the Benzo
Ballin', got me feelin' like Jim Jones, I'm a pimp though
No limp though, couldn't copy my style in Kinkos
Put in work, run up on a killer, then I put him in the dirt
Run up in the building, semi gon' squirt
That's what a nigga get when they getting on my nerves
I ain't lying, lay 'em on the curb
Ridin' on a killer who be coming at Ferg (Damn)
Girl, you twerk, twerk that kitty, girl, make it purr
Put in work, Flacko put 'em in the dirt
French got the shovel, he gon' put him in the earth
Trinidad maniac with an all-gold hearse
Yeah, uh, put in work
ScHoolboy Q with a pound of the purp
So much work he'll smoke up the Earth
Polo Ground, A$AP World

[Verse 2: French Montana]
(Haaan!) That ain't Kanye
That's Montana, loose cannon
He shot me, so I had to do it
Put him in the dirt, put him in it first
I just sold a swammy with ten homis on it
Her ass fat, you could park ten Tahoes on it
When they mask up, comin' for your ice
When they bare-faced, they comin' for your life
Baby, don't pray for me, pray for the weak
I'm drinkin' lean, it help me sleep
Illuminati? I'm from the streets
Never sold my body, we takin' bodies

[Hook]
Put in work, put in work
Put in work, put 'em in the dirt

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
Shout out that motherland, 12-years-old with guns in hand
They don't ask no questions, nigga
All they do is bang bang bang
They don't ask no questions, all they do is bang bang
I said I do this for them shottas, Trinidad, I love ya
I do this for them shottas, Jamaica, I'm your brother
I know a bitch from VI, yeah-yeah-yeah, that's my partner
You got a problem with it
Then-then-then-then that's your problem
I fuck with Asian niggas and I fuck with Migos
I fuck with Haitian niggas, all they speak is Creole
I said all I speak is real, y'all niggas might hate me
But that don't get no deal, I said no, that don't get no deal
I just now got my deal, but I been gettin' this money
No green card in this struggle
Immigration give you nothing but work (Put it in work)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
YAWK-YAWK, YAWK-YAWK!
A lot of niggas died, should've been from Hoover Street
No, I do not have a car, but I could buy one every week
Pimpin' like I'm 33, move keys like I'm 36
Ship O's like I'm 28, Tacoma know I'm pushin' weight
O-X-Y, I'm in your state, eatin' off your dinner plate
My heart live where Santa stay, super fly, I need a cape
Bitches throwin' pussy back and forth, they on my dick
Passion drippin' off her lip, she say she never had a Crip
Uh, put in work, all big booties make it twerk
All big titties lift your shirt, show a player what you're worth
Yeah, put in work, spray his ass in front of the church
Deacon said I did my shit, the pastor said, ""That nigga turnt.""
Pop my collar on my shirt, make these bitches go berserk
Shippin' units; Captain Kirk, takin' xannies, poppin' percs
Might not last, I'll bomb you first
Turn your backseat to a hearse
Back to the lab with mother Earth
Had to give Young Ferg a verse

[Verse 5: A$AP Rocky]
A lot of homies cried, due to crimes, homicide
Drivin' by, poppin' nines, Pakistan, Columbine
Out of line, pistols barkin' *argh argh*, ride or die
Write a script, design a line, all I see is dollar signs
You want that pretty Flacko? Ratchets, designer jackets
The same niggas who jack it be the first who claim we faggots
My bitch is a movie actress, side bitch won a beauty pageant
Got a chick that worked at Magic
But I'm so damn fine make a bitch look average
See, my daddy in Heaven, right next to Ferg's
You know what's up I'm throwin' bucks
Loaded Lux; put in work

Chill!!!

My momma was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that ""Don't touch anything in the store""
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that ""Come in, please buy more""
""What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things""
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves

Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye

I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See that's that privately owned prison
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up

I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive

Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

[Verse 1]
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'mma need a little more time now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want something out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it
So let's get on with it

[Verse 2]
We could've been somebody
'stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'

[Verse 3]
You could've been somebody
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia

Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas

To all my second string bitches, try and get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That goin' to that owin' money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh, yeah-yeah, she got you homie, yeah
'til death but do your part, unholy matrimony

That summer night holdin' long and long, 'din long
Now waiting for the summer rose and (breathe)
And breathe and breathe

And live and learn
And live and learn
And livin' and livin' like I’m lonely
Lonely, lonely
And livin' all I have
And livin' all
And live
And live

Riccardo Tisci Givenchy clothes
See me throning at the Met
Vogueing on these niggas, champagne on my breath, yes
House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern
Cause I be going ape at the auction
Oh what a feeling, aw, fuck it, I want a trillion
Sleeping every night next to Mona Lisa
The modern day version with better features
Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner
Go 'head, lean on that shit Blue, you own it

[Hook]
Oh, what a feeling
Picasso baby
Picasso
Picasso baby
Oh, what a feeling
Picasso baby
Picasso
Picasso baby

""Et là je t'ai tout donné, montré, rien à cacher, tu es là Ivy, comme le nombre d'or. Jay, comment tu dis nombre d'or?""

[Jay Z]
""The golden number.""

[Woman]
""Touché.""

[Verse 3]
I never stuck my cock in the fox's box but
Damned if I ain't open Pandora's box
They try to slander your man on CNN and Fox
My Mirandas don't stand a chance with cops
Even my old fans like, ""Old man, just stop""
I could if I would, but I can't, I'm hot
And you blow, I'm still the man to watch
Hublot on my left hand or not
Soon I step out the booth, the cameras pops
Niggas is cool with it 'til the canons pop
Now my hand on the Bible on the stand
Got your man in a jam again, got my hands in cuff
I'm like goddamn enough
I put down the cans and they ran amok
My hairpin pierce skin, ruptures spleens
Cracks ribs, go through cribs, and other things
No sympathy for the king, huh?
Niggas even talk about your baby crazy
Eventually the pendulum swings
Don't forget America this how you made me
Come through with the 'Ye mask on
Spray everything like SAMO, I won't scratch the Lambo
What's it gon take for me to go
For you to see, I'm the modern day Pablo, Picasso baby

Okay, now let's be real I know you feel some type of way

Go through hell cause I care, move you far away
Drop you off late, know he feel some type of way
I got hoes like golf trynna make what Tiger makes

I heard that he the leader, come follow my tribe today
I fucked her now he heated, he feel some type of way

It's about to be a helluva night
It's about to be a helluva night

Mustard on the beat, ho
Luda!

Rollin down the highway
Nothing for me to do but smoke as if it's a Friday
Break it down, spread it out, nigga roll up
And let's see what they about, call the hoes up
Ludacris, man these bitches want my last name
Sip slow but I'm drivin all in the fast lane
Get the fuck up out my way, man, move bitch
And hoodie yappin if you never wanna do shit
I'm all about it, get yo mind right
Been making money since before I was in the lime light
Grind like – bitch, wussup!
Top down but I feel like getting fucked up
I get high but the bass low
A real nigga, what yo a woman wanna shake fo
When you shake it for a baller better shake it right
Cause it's about to be a hell of a night

It's about to be a helluva night
It's about to be a helluva night
It's about to be a helluva night
It's about to be a helluva night

I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up
I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell
(It's about to be a helluva night)

Club packed and women gettin they drink on
Just lookin for a reason to get they freak on
Catch me up in the VIP and it's roped off
To keep raggedy ass hoes off
Then I'm bout to have a smoke off
Rich nigga but I'm tryna get broke up
Turn it up as I make the beat break down
Ass up, face down
Yea, that's still the best way to get it
Down the middle, that's the best way to split it
I'm talkin money, disturbin the peace, racked up
One too many American black cards stacked up
Backed up and it's on
Don't get beat down to the song
I feel these hatin ass niggas wanna fight
Well, It's about to be a helluva night

It's about to be a helluva night
It's about to be a helluva night
It's about to be a helluva night
It's about to be a helluva night

I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up
I'm fucked up – I'm fucked up
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell
I'm high as hell – I'm high as hell
(It's about to be a helluva night)

I'm always looking for trouble to get into
Tell your girlfriend's friends, bring friends too
What you drinkin? I got it all, pour it all up
Southside, my partners – they throw it all up
I don't want a ménage so bitch let go
I'm tryna get 3 women play connect 4
Congratulations, you made it into the top 5
Your mouth help me push the Bentley into Mach 5
She got me speedin in the red zone
Or as Luda like to call it, this the head zone
Heads up, I'm bread winner and the bread's up
So make a peace sign, baby put yo legs up
Is it really that good to ya?
Do you like it when a nigga talk hood to ya?
Do you like a little scratch, a little bite?
Well, It's about to be a hell of a night

It's about to be a helluva night
It's about to be a helluva night
It's about to be a helluva night
It's about to be a helluva night

[Verse 1]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, ‘cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em ""Stick it!""
So sick I'm looking pale, wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Hook]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Hook]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, ‘cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's banging, jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowing up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowing down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho...

[Pre-Hook]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Hook 2]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, ‘cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berzerk, get your vinyls

[Scratch]

[Verse 3]
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh, sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am trying to find a way to get you a loan; car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixing to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick, word man, you heard
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Pre-Hook]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Hook]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, ‘cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go

Man, I guess I'm a optimist
Born in Toronto, but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talking 'bout?
Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace
We stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows Versace, the sheets are Versace
I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world
Like, ""What the fuck is he plannin'?""
Just make sure that you got a back up plan
‘Cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is comin'
September, just wait on it
This year I'm eatin' your food
And my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house
I sit back, like, ""Damn, I look great on it.""
I do not fuck with your new shit
My nigga, don't ask for my take on it
Speakin' in lingo
Man, this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelings, ‘cause business is business
It's strictly financial
I'm always the first one to get it
Man, that's how you lead by example
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Word to New York
‘Cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me ""Papi""

Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that

Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours

Got your main bitch on my dick shit she ain’t nothin' (You lame)
Her hips fat I seen her walk past I was like shit
She seen my Audemar she tried to touch that, I said bitch
I bang hoes ridin' in the top drop Range Rove
I train hoes I’m a pimp Trinidad James clothes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Three, FDB man, fly like AirTran
Me and E-Louie's got checkerboards on
You ain’t got that pair, man
With my FDB clique, 33 deep shit
You tell that bitch man fuck that ho
I ain't stuntin' that shit trick
Six for a birdbath, bitch, where’s your skirt at?
Ah I like it blowin' that kush on you like purp packs
Y’all niggas so whack and bitch you so green
I pull up on the scene in the green Saleen
Yeah nigga I’m too clean
Westside what's upper? Y'all niggas my supper
Fuck that bitch 'fore I do that shit
I might need me a rubber
Belly on rotund, one whip, four guns
If you see the baby mamma holler:
Fuck that bitch, that ho ain't no one

[Hook]

[Outro]
Westside, Bankhead, is where I'm from
Everything y’all did, it been done
My True game and my shoe game
You can’t touch that shit
A bitch that holler ‘bout ""fuck me?""
Nah, fuck that bitch

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't know why they been lyin'
But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statements just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum!
I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

[Hook: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said ""Girl, that's all that we do.""
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said ""Girl, that's all that we do.""

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'Bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with you back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Hook: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck

[Outro: Birdman]
Famous and dangerous, you understand me?
Showtime, headlines, big time
Sunshine, tote 9's, bust mines
Flatline, hard grind, high life
Stay fly, it's jet time – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Swag on head to feet nigga – stunt, nigga!
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Hook]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same

[Hook]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low

Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low

[Bridge]
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

[Verse 3]
This the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

[Outro]
Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out""

[Hook: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much

[Verse 2: Drake]
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess,"" Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

[Hook: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much

Ohhh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, ohhh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'

[Intro: Jhene Aiko]
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, cause...

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us

[Verse 1]
Comin' off the last record, I'm gettin' 20 million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga, rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I don't have to tell 'em that I'm rich
Self explanatory, you just here to spread the story, wassup

[Verse 2]
Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye, B I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

[Verse 3]
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these 90's fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like fuck it, like YOLO
Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself""
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me, now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?

[Outro]
If there's hell below. I'll see you when you get there. Are you enjoyin' yourselves? If we may we'd just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational. Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years. It don't mean that we can't have a good life. So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us

We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the same

[Verse 1]
Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something

Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that noila got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something

[Hook]
Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru

Girl you know we got thangs to do

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout bustin' raps
And standing for somethin'; fuckin' acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem—why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves
And close the gate up, I'm afraid of what
Will happen to them wolves, when the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon
Nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff, came up rough
Came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, ‘cause…

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest

This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals
I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank
Maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can
Man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter—I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck!
But I light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow
I'm stabbin' myself with a fuckin' knife in the gut
While I'm wipin' my butt
‘Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood
You're in a fight with a nut
‘Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all

So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle
Now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
‘Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
‘Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
‘Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, ‘cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, ‘cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go at'chu then a-chieve!

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Intro sample + Eminem]
Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it
Six minutes. Six Minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
Just a feeling I've got
Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means
We're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

[Hook 1]
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his, nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity-rap, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots, and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece

[Hook 2]
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret
To rap immortality like I have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MC's get taken to school with this music
‘Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bust a rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C. and induct them
Into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of (shame)
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy
You're witnessing a massacre, like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!"", that's all they say, looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, looking boy
Hey, looking boy! What you say, looking boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, looking boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, looking boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy

[Hook 3]
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track
Call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton – no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken; I'm the walking dead
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm
And pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure, somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case, ‘cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you, like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya
Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
‘Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma
You assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me
And it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feelin' like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
‘Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous
They confuse it; ""It's not hip-hop, it's pop.""
‘Cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to?
Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself, ‘cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you!
I'm drunk – so Satan, take the fuckin' wheel!
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something
I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have
Then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons, make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard; be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?

[Intro]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, no- (Uh-huh, honey)

[Bridge: Kanye West]
All them other niggas lame, and you know it now
When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown

Bound to fall in love

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking-round-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

Rec League, I ain't paying to ball
Y'all B-string like a broke guitar
And I still put it down like the family dog
Yeah, I murder some, I murder one
Explain it all, Ferguson
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song
Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
Yeah, what you saying to it?
Old money look, no money don't do it
Make 'em turn around in their lane like a U-ey
And I'm only looking back if I'm looking at her booty
(At her booty) What's the rationale?
They wanna smoke niggas when they black & mild
So we acting out—okay, cool

Nah, nah, they can't hold me

I double dare you, I'm Marc Summers
I scorch winters, I burn autumns
Gut niggas, so Kurt Vonne
Elle Varner, got a crush on her
I gotta wait in line for that
Ain't nobody got time for that
Ain't nobody gotta rhyme with that

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side till 3005, hold up

[Verse 1]
Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up

[Hook]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side till 3005
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (say what)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)

Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)...

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hold up

Hair so long, I'm about to bring the fro back
Phone call gotta say ""Moshi moshi"" (Moshi moshi)
Girlfriend actin' all wishy-washy (wishy-washy)
It's your birthday, make it earthquake
Fell in love with a nigga like a mermaid (Daddy, I love him!)
That's a first date, nobody think about it, worst case
Best case, we the front page, 10K on the first day
Yeah, mothafucka, take your phone out
To record this, ain't nobody can ignore this
I'm more or less a moral-less individual
Making movies with criminals, tryin' to get them residuals
When it all go crazy, when I hear that action, I'ma be Scorsese
My nigga hold it horizontal man, be professional (Worldstar!)

Worldstar, worldstar

[Verse 2]
My girl ain't bad, she more like evil
When I'm lookin' in the mirror, how fly's this negro?
She on Hollywood and Vine
Thinkin' that she Hollywood on Vine
Makin' movies with her friends all the time
Showin' off her ass, that's a net twerk
But I saw through it like a wet shirt
Drive slow cause you might swerve off it
Still eat and the hate so salty
Put shrooms in my roommate's coffee
And got more likes than a white girl talking
More hits than a fight comp
Where they fight cops 'til they stop, when I heard shots
Watching dude drop from a Glock at a—(shots fired)
Let me flash on 'em, we all big brother now
Lil' sis, let her run around
Money talking, you know the sound—brrrr
Money counter—brrrr, AK—brrrr
Cell phone—brrrr—Hello?

""Yo, bro man, check out that video I just sent you, man. This shit's hilarious, man. It's like this kid, man, he got like—he got like hit on the side of the head, man, he's like freakin' out

But your shit is like the police askin' us questions

Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us

Just to see if I'm finished

So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done grown up

Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessins at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

She can get it, my whole click with it
No question, we are on the champion flight
This is how I ride, my passenger fly
We take off in London and land in the Dubai
This is a marriage, the music my ride
My life is so lavish, you don't recognize
So let's toast to a new day in Rochan
80 million they still rollercoasting
What's the recipe to this devotion?
I got the melody, sober like couches

Oh-eh-oh
Who told y'all the party's over?
Oh-eh-oh
Well, it ain't over till I told y'all
I feel my cup runnin' over
Tomorrow I  might be sober
But oh, tonight, I'm like

I fly High!
It's a new day
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
It's a new day
And you know how I feel

Bruh, I see, girls everywhere
Titty, ass, hands in the air, it's a party over here

[Verse 1]
Home of the party and the trees
Sunny land of the G's, please let a nigga breathe
Tank top top down for the breeze
Burnt lips, got a blunt full of weed, peace, love, enemies
Nigga I ain't come for the beef
You ain't know she came for the skeet? Got pipe for the cheeks
Nigga, I'm the life of the beat
Fuck that, this year gotta eat, bounce for the crown
You be hating and I still hold it down
When you round man the girls never lounge, man I heard you a hound
Bruh, man, that bitch need a pound
Tip-tip-tip bounce out her gown, hands high to the sound
Uh, yeah, I'm the rich nigga now
Bitch, I'm the talk of the town, make a bitch run her mouth
Go south for the boy
Pop down to the floor... bounce
Bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce

[Verse 2]
Home of the slanging on the curb
Weed cards every corner sell herb, what's a fly to a bird?
Nigga, I could pitch you a curb
Let this real shit occur, make mills from a verb
Nigga cop a crib in the burbs, nigga
You ain't said nothing but a word, smoke something for ya nerve
Home of the paid on the first
Then nigga going broke by the third, bounce for the crown
Fast forward getting real tell me now
Every dog need a cat to meow, every once in a while
I see hands in the crowds
See whites, blacks blazing a pound, jumping around
Tits, ass bump out her gown
Bounce from the ground, hype for the sound
This verse straight from the morgue
Pop down from the floor... bounce
Bounce
Bounce, bounce

[Produced by The Alchemist]

[Verse 1]
Fuck rap, I've been rich, crack by my stick shift
Oxy like concerts, always my bread first
GetMine my nickname, O-X and cocaine
Nina my new thing, blew up before fame
Heart filled with octane, fire in my soul
Burn through my shoestring, came up from boosting
Du-rags and flatlines, drive-bys at bedtime
Get down, I heard mom, someone lost they grandson
Thank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed
Lost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils
Good weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay

[Hook]
So now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like
La-da-di-do, la-di-da-di-da-di-do
Now we 'bout to break the bank

Now we 'bout to break the bank

[Verse 2]
My time to show out, finally the illest Crip
And I guarantee, I spit harder than concrete
Surprised I got teeth, my lungs inhale keef
Peyote with THC, swinging for the fence
I hope I make it out the park, where the baseheads slide
After dark, where the bangers get caught
Hid the gun in the trees, arrest me by the court
I just wanna smoke weed and sip lean by the quart, for real
Good weed, I hit that, crack rock, I sold that
Oxy, I hid that, right by my nutsack
Fuck pigs, I bust back, learned that from Deuce rap
Peanut and B-loon, had gats before racks
Way 'fore I found rap, bitch, I had them things wrapped
Astro on my cap, this shot ain't no phone app
Chucks on my young heel, make sure that my sag ill
Learn my set trip grill, trade in my big wheel
Good grades and skipped school, this life gon' catch up soon
Sure 'nough that shit did, twenty-year-old kid
Got off my behind, write me some sweet lines
Cause one day my story gon' pay

[Hook]
So now we 'bout to break the bank

[Interlude]
Your bitch wanted cash, get her, know I'm around, boy
Tell Kendrick, move from the throne, I came for it
I hope this fuckin' hit arrange for it, cause goddamn
What you talkin' 'bout if it ain't 'bout the money?
Neck full of gold, I'm attracted to the honey
Rain, sleet, snow, 'bout the money
On Figueroa, close your eyes, might need ya mommy

[Verse 3]
Fuck rap, my shit real, came up off them pills
Hustle for my meal, grindin' for my deal
Love how I'm doin', long way from grooving
Bitch call me 2 Chainz, units be moving
Go hard for my Joy, so she don't need no boy
Smile stay on her face, big room with her own space
Up all night, the hard way, don't care if it take all day
I let y'all fucks parler, you wonder why I'm straight
New shoes and sick clothes, bitches be front row
Bow down her temple, I don't know her info
Threw up my peace sign, go rare with my mignon
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay

Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked
Half-Thai thickie, all she wanna do is Bangkok
Got her hair done, French braids now she A$AP
Bino so insensitive, she asking, ""Why you say that?!""
I'm chillin', real nigga feeling
Rich kid, asshole: paint me as a villain
Still spitting that cash flow: DJ Khaled
I got a penthouse on both coasts: pH balance
Real nigga, I rep those, why though? Cause I said so
Hip deep in the Pepto, I got five on her like Ben Folds
I got more tail than that PetCo
You faker than some Sweet'N Low
Yeah, you got some silverware
But really are you eating though?
Are you eating though? Nigga, are you eating though?
Breakfast, lunch and dinner's for beginners
You ain't even know—
Never catching cases, why they faces look so E-M-O?
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano
My architect know Japanese, yo' girl, she jocking these
No hands like soccer teams and y'all fuck boys like Socrates
You niggas ain't copping these, niggas ain't looking like me
Nah, I ain't checking I.D. but I bounce 'em with no problem
Tell 'em, Problem (Problem!)

[Bridge: Childish Gambino]
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)
I'm winnin', yeah, yeah, I'm winnin' (What?)
Rich kid, asshole, paint me as a villain

[Hook: Problem]
Whaaat?
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you, fuck it, what you gon' do?

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Different color, my passport, Instagram my stack load
Hashtag my day wear and your girl drink my day care
And I'm born rich, life ain't fair (silver spoon coon, ho)
Ain't nobody sicker and my Fisker, ""vroom, vroom,"" ho
Ain't nobody—
Fiskers don't make noise when they start up...
Just so you know
Top of the Hold 'em totem, rich forever
A million was not the quota
My father owned half the MoMA and did it with no diploma
Year off, got no rules, tripping off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods
And I'm too fly: Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisades, that a-k-a
White hood, white hood, (okay-kay-kay)
Furniture custom, you shop at IKEA
So Maserati, you whipping a Kia
Spending this money, it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola, me and Sofia
Waking up broke, man, wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dope man, help a nigga re-up
Bring a girlfriend, man, trouble when I see her
""Err-eh-err-eh"": onomatopoeia
Oh, I got my cool on! (Tailormade!)
I'm winning so they had to dump the Gatorade
And I don't give a fuck about my family name

[Hook: Problem]
Whaaat?
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Don't be mad cause I'm doing me better than you doing you

I'mma keep it movin’ be classy and graceful
I told 'em it’s no friends in the game, you ain’t learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don’t burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earned that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible, that
They love you, when really they no different from all your rivals
But I still don’t wish death on ‘em, I just reflect on 'em

[Pre-Hook]
Pills n' potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
We’re overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

[Hook]
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

[Verse 2]
Yo, people will love you and support you when it’s beneficial
I'mma forgive, I won't forget, but I'mma dead the issue
Soon as you out a nigga’s life is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good now, it’s kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in a Benzy, I see the envy, when I’m causing a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em, cop cribs in the hills, on ‘em

[Pre-Hook]
Pills n' potions
We're overdosin'
I'm angry but I still love you
Pills n potions
We’re overdosin'
Can't stand it but I still love you

[Hook]
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

[Bridge]
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
In due time we’ll be fine
In due time

[Hook]
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still lo-o-ove
I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

I don't know what these niggas speakin' off

Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal
Don't say my name unless you suicidal
Don't get to close unless you suicidal
Dont touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Money won't ease us
Man niggas even hated on Jesus
Living life on the road on the chase for the money
Cause the hoes won't please us
Yeezus told us there's blood on the leaves
Ain't no love in the streets
Let her run into me and she wanted to meet
Now she fuck with a G
Got your bitch not wanting to speak
Hold up, y'all mahfuckers tried to shit on us
Chain all lit all up
Porsche with the horse like get on up
And my bitch got that shit on her
Rock Balmain cause I'm ballin'
I put red bottoms on red models
And no more red bottles
Straight Belarie nigga every bottles
Ricky Rozay we in here
Double M G we've been here
Straight from the north side
Right by the project how did I get here
Sippin' on lean with a bad ass bitch
From the Hills, probably live there
And get money like me
And the pussy so wet I need swimwear
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Suicide doors, riding around with a suicide whore
There's no love in the streets and this blood on my sneaks got suicide on them
Going everywhere you are not going
Doing everything you are not doing
And I've been out to get it and you mention my niggas that's suicide on them
Right back to the money my nigga no we don't play
Say my name and that's D.O.A
And all these chains is saying we okay
And we drink Champagne, eat Frito Lays
At lunchtime, do it for the ghetto one time
I don't even know how to tell time, look at our time
Cause the watch say bust down and the whole band is drumline
Me and my nigga, Rozay that's my nigga
D-Boy, that's my hitter
You ain't doing wrong, as long as you don't touch my hitter
South finger fuck my trigger, smoking on strong
None of y'all can fuck with us
None of y'all gossip, Jigga
Give me my throne, and you ain't gonna like my picture
Leave a comment, fuck nigga
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

[Hook]
I don't know what these niggas speakin' off
I don't know what these niggas trippin' on
Don't touch my niggas I suggest you don't

Don't say my name unless you suicidal
Don't get to close unless you suicidal
Dont touch my niggas I suggest you don't
Boy if you do you must be suicidal

[Bridge: Paloma Ford]
You must be suicidal
When we pull up, watch the suicide doors
I've been too deep, make 'em call the 5-0
If he surprised, I know that gun go
BLAT, BLAT, BLAT, BLAT
This kush got me so on
Man I'm so on
We ridin' 'round, we gettin' money
Don't act like you don't know

I don't know, it's just something about ya
Got me feelin' like I can't be without ya
Anytime someone mention your name
I be feelin' as if I'm around ya
Ain't no words to describe you baby
All I know is that you take me high
Can you tell that you drive me crazy?
Cause I can't get you out my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Think of you when I'm going to bed
When I wake up, think of you again
You are my homie, lover and friend
Exactly why

[Chorus]
You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how
Well you're the reason why
I'm dancing in the mirror
And singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da
Singing in the shower
La-da-dee, la-da-da, la-da-da

All I want, all I need is your lovin'
Baby you make me hot like an oven
Since you came, you know what I discovered?
Baby, I don't need me another
No, no, all I know
Only you got me feeling so
And you know that I got to have ya
And I don't plan to let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Think of you when I'm going to bed
When I wake up, think of you again
You are my homie, lover and friend

Oh, oh
There ain't no guarantee
But I'll take chance on we
Baby let's take our time
(Singing in the shower)
And when the times get rough
There ain't no givin' up
Cause it just feel so right
(Singing in the shower)
Don't care what others say
If I got you, I'm straight
You'll bring my heart to life
Yeah

You light me up inside
Like the 4th of July
Whenever you're around
I always seem to smile
And people ask me how

Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple on the red carpet
And I'm flyer than that nigga on the hang glider
Four, five, six, seven chains on, just stay in your lane, ho
Don't you like these A. Wang's? Don't you like these gold fangs?

[Verse 1]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
The 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Outro]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish

Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal

[Verse 1]
Yeah, no  telling what i might do
When I'm in the right mood
You know me
I'm all up in the party like a V.I.P
And everything is looking better from my P.O.V
Nocturnal animals, we don't sleep
And I'll probably forget you, Cee Lo Green (Cee Lo)
I'm sweatin like the amazon, a hundred degrees
And that back sides bigger than a family tree
So drop that thing like a fumble
Like ya talking to the king of the jungle
We got lions, tigers, bears oh my
And every single ones turnt up, yo
I don't want anybody bringing the vibes down
So if you want to wind down, oh look what I found
A little something that'll keep you awake
Until the break of dawn
Don't be afraid to get rowdy

[Pre-Chorus]
We're not done yet
Pass me the bottle
Its 2 a.m., lets hit the throttle
Drink in my cup
Hand going up
Lets hit the dance floor and get...

Jam packed, got a couple bands back
From the back on my last trip like a ransacked
Everybody hanging like a string from a Tampax
Yes, my bitches back from the Amtrak
You ain't never heard of flow quite like this
Everywhere I turn seeing iced out wrists
She might be German, she might be Swiss, (god damn)
And I'm feeling pretty hectic, lights all around
Good thing I'm not epileptic
I'm kinda confused like I'm measuring in metric
Talking shit, you better take it back interception
Like the forests are blazing
Get the wild life jumping like an animal rave
I know your parents say they miss the good old days
But things change

We're not done yet
Pass me the bottle

Free everybody in the chain gang
It's been two days since I laid down
Kool Moe Dee, five chains on

Yeah, them diamonds so cool, yeah, that old school mine fo'
Never heard about you, all my hoes, they so rude
Tats all on me, nigga, trill-ass individual
Go and check on that nigga, sit on my Balmain zipper
Got a airtight schedule, fuck your bitch, just met her

Young niggas got to get to the money
Five chains, so they look at me funny
Showed up with the juice and the troops
Roll a seven every time I shoot
She said, ""Why you got so many condoms with you?""
I say, ""I'm a player, to be honest with you""
Hublot, woo, so shiny
Mind you, my crew right behind me
Went shopping, could've bought an island
Talking money when I'm with Italians
Spilling purple on the red carpet
And I'm flyer than that nigga on the hang glider
Four, five, six, seven chains on, just stay in your lane, ho
Don't you like these A. Wang's? Don't you like these gold fangs?
You a well-known flexer, I'm a young trendsetter
These hoes, they reckless, they slick, they messy
Three hoes freak dancing, wit' the loud, singing acapella
Chain clang like heavy metal

I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl
Don't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain
Surrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?
Is it cause a nigga cook like a professor?
I don't know how you feel can you tell me?
I won't know how you feel 'til you tell me
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Is it cause I'm a star
It maybe could be my star status
I got my chain and ring
My Rolex watch it got 50 carats
It could be QC or even maybe it's me
It could be that 4 hour flight, shopping in Beverly
What's on your mind? I'm not Ginuwine
Ain't tryna spend no time
I know my bitch she so fine
But I don't know what's on her mind
Gotta pay that cost to be a boss
I put on my Louboutins playing golf
Young nigga walking with Nina Ross
I'm dropping the bombs like Viet Cong

I don't know how you feel can you tell me?
I won't know how you feel 'til you tell me
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
They say I'm picky cause all my bitches exquisite
I'm in some vintage Givenchy smokin' a Philly
The dope that I sell is the purest
The junkies they hit it, they scratchin' and itchin'
The flow that we killin', the flow that we spittin'
My nigga you know we invented it
Dripping in St. Louis, I'm a lunatic
I'm a Migo but my bitch an immigrant
I got the boot but no Timberland
I am the plug, you the middle man
I never leave my niggas starvin'
You niggas mistake me for Marvin
I got 15 bricks I'm finna drop
In there right next to that carbine

[Hook]
I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl

I won't know how you feel 'til you tell me

[Verse 3: Offset]
Is it my looks or is it my wealth?
Or is it the way that I carry myself?
Let me know I need some help
Don't keep that secret to yourself
Bitches be saying I'm acting funny cause a young nigga got a lotta money
She lookin' at me like she want somethin'
Can't give her nothin' but a couple hundreds
She sucked up on a nigga, tryna give a nigga kisses, baby girl you trippin'
(I don't know how you feel can you tell me?)
I know why you came in this club tonight
Looking for a nigga that's gon' change your life

[Verse 1]
I'm not the table you can come and lay your cup down on now
I’m not the shoulder for a bag, don't wanna carry your heavy load
I'm not the road that you take when you're lookin for a short cut, uh
I ain't the steppin' stone, to be steppin' on, I ain't nobodys crutch
I ain't the money man, with your money man, you ain't lookin' at me
I'm not the cheap one, lookin' at me son, you ain't lookin' at free
I ain't the dish rag, to come clean up, all the shit that ya dish out
Ain't got no check for em, if you checkin' in
Mothafucka check this out

[Hook]
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do till it's gone
Oh, oh, till it's gone
Oh, oh, till it's gone
Oh, oh, till it's gone
Oh, but what can I do if I do till it's gone

[Verse 2]
I'm not the trash can, not the last man at the finish line now
I'm not the new kid, on the block
That you can just follow and push around
I'm not the fuckin' needle in the haystack, that you finally found
This ain't no free rent, come and pitch a tent, you ain't tying me down
I'm not a bus ride you can hop inside, and just roll away clean
Not the wheel on the wagon you wanna break
'Cause I hold up the weight for the team
I'm not the gold watch, and the new truck
That you scheming to check out
Unless you're looking to check out *shot, shot, shot*
What a mess now (c'mon)

[Hook]
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit
It doesn't mean I have to come deal with it
You handle your own when you become a man
And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do till it's gone
Oh, oh, till it's gone
Oh, oh, till it's gone
Oh, oh, till it's gone
Oh, what can I do if I do till it's gone

[Verse 3]
I jump to the sky for my people
I walk through the fire, I give love when it's equal
Don't tell me not to complain about my money and fame
When you come around and tellin' me I changed
Damn right I fuckin' changed
When this fuckin' change in my pocket
Hit the bucket, it was a rocket all a sudden
I went from shoppin' without nuthin'
To goin' shoppin' for my cousins
Now that the cops know that I'm buzzin'
They wanna drop me in the oven
Pull me over just to say ""I'm a fan""
Hip-hop, gotta love it, fuck it

[Hook]
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But I'm not a fool, there's no need to pretend
Just because you got yourself in some shit

And become a man when you handle your own
Ain't much I can do but I do what I can
But what can I do if I do till it's gone
Oh, oh, till it's gone
Oh, oh, till it's gone

Oh, what can I do if I do till it's gone

What you spending when you shopping, dawg?

Blowin' on the kush, 'til I'm out of sight
I don't check the price, all I do is swipe
She said, ""What's your type?"", I said, ""I like what I like""
I don't second guess, I just roll the dice (keep it moving)
Keep your two cents, take your own advice
I've been livin' life, like I lived twice

[Verse 1]
And I'm down to catch a body, bitches, hit that hommy switch
And I bet that all these hollow tips gon' make his body twitch
But if I hit you with the shotty, bitch, I bet that body flip
Rasha caught him with them zombie tips and made his body spin
You niggas leap, you feelin' froggy, bitch, my niggas doggies, bitch
Run up on him with that forty, bitch and go retarded, bitch
Fuck ya feelings, ain't no sorries, bitch, no sorries, bitch
Shoot that nigga and his shorty, bitch, shorty, bitch

[Verse 2]
And I'm shootin' niggas left to right if they ain't steppin' right
My lil nigga keep that weapon tight, he'll leave you dead on sight
Look lil nigga, we the flexin' type, you feel like flexin', aight?
Put a bullet in ya head tonight, we leave you dead tonight
Tell that bitch I need some head tonight, I got my cheddar right
She said, how much you tryna spend tonight? I got the better price
I said, I can't even spend the night, I gotta catch a flight
But I still touch it down like Jerry Rice, Jerry Rice, touchdown

Fuck around and I'm a catch a body

Bitch I got the mac or the 40
Turn a bitch to some macaroni
Tell me how you want it I'm on it
I really mean it I'm just not recordin'
Give lil bro the choppa for all you oppas
Leave a bitch nigga head in pasta
You are an impostor, ain't got no money
Put the burner to his tummy, and make it bubbly
I really hate niggas I'm a Nazi
Love wearin' all black, you should see my closet
Rock that all white, when I'm feelin' Godly
Hop out like Coke, I ain't gotta park it
Fuck is y'all saying, bitch my hood love me
48214 real niggas know me
I been out my mind since they killed my cousin
Free my cousin Devin, man he just called me
All these niggas love me, can't get 'em off me
Fuck around gave him my number, he won't stop callin'

V.I.P in the plural, while yo section borin'
Got a bitch that set it off like Jada Pinkett, Queen Latifah
You rollin' around wit yo nieces, bitch you T.T
Mind full of money, got a heart full of demons

Turn yo face into a pizza, no acne

So lifted, flyer than yo girl, baby gone and take my picture

And I ain't signin' to no label, bitch I'm independent

[Chorus]
Let a nigga try me, try me

[Intro]
Cole, Cole world, yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well

[Verse 1]
Wasn't nothin' like that
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with a fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
‘Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deep, and
Wet dreaming, thinkin' that I'm smashin', but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said ""You ever had sex before?""
Damn…

[Hook]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said, ""Of course I had sex before""
Knowing I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'""
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinking how that body look naked
When you laying on the bed
Teacher, please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like ""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan""
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talking shit, knowing damn well I was a virgin, fuck

[Hook]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
You know that feeling when you know you finna bone for the first time?
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying, ""God, don't let me bust quick""
I'm watching pornos, trying to see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin'
And her face start blushin', and a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled
And her hands start rubbin' on me, ooh girl, don't stop
It's time for action: pull out the condoms real smooth
Yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it
And said, ""I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause...""

[Hook]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, nooo
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

First things first: Rest In Peace Uncle Phil, for real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'mma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen even back when we was broke my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga...

She don't wanna be saved

She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her
She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her

[Verse 1]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory
My memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch; not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up and tell her
""Hey, what's good?""
""Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'mma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

She don't wanna be saved
Don't save her

I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood, bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes
Fuck em then we kick em to the do', nigga you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap, she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt
'Fore she leave—I'mma need my shirt back
Nigga you know how it go

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas—probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once—shame on—shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 3]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face cause they know it's they song
She shallow, but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow, but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow, but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow, but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Oh right, oh
Oh why na-da-da-da

I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the Lord to follow me
I've been unfaithful
I don't know why you call on me

[Verse 1]
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it how I want it baby, oh I
This is my canvas
I'ma paint it, paint it, paint it, how I want it nigga
Fuck you cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song
I like to write alone, be in my zone
Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish, I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl
Damn she so selfless
But she put up with my ways
Because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together
(I love you mama)

I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me

You believe in me, and I thank you for it, oh I

Another day, another rhyme, ho
Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right
I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up, and regurgitate me
Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came, niggas can't wait for one of these
I see you nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's a AP nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me nigga—uh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, ""Thanks for the view"", waiting on thanks from a few
Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
I'm taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing
Getting head like a coin toss, too easy

[Hook]
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I don't know freedom
I want my dreams to rescue me

(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt
(Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
You tell me ya still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it

[Verse 3]
Listen...
History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?

[Outro]
We all kings
(We all kings nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
The reality, he's a coward
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God
(It's only one God nigga)
It's for all the kings
Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved

Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?

Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it

Listen up I'm about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga

Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip

Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let em' kill your dream
It'll haunt you nigga, haunt you

[Hook 2]
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things?
Guess not! (What's the value of a thing?)
Last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
(You know what the fuck it is nigga, run that shit!)
Uh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

[Outro]
Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found
So why just take me man, take me man, take me man
Your wish is my command, my command, my command

Jar full of weed, baby girl I got plenty
Break fast for the chick like I work at Denny's
Shawty where the shots I need many, many, many

Solo soy tuyo no te equivoques
Y lo que tu piensas que estoy jugando
Esto se puso feo, se esta calentando

Y por la noche na na na

En la tarde arreglamos
Y en la cama nos matamos
Pero algo siempre pasa
Y de nuevo nos peleamos

Yeah, these days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?

Six in the morn', fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me
Black don't crack, my nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Hook]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 2]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Verse 3]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

[Hook]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
(King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 2]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (oh yeah)

[Hook]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'

Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 3]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge, I made it past 25, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king

[Hook]
Bitch, where was you when I was walkin'—(*POP*)
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—(*POP*)
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
(King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where was you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Outro]
(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk)
We want the funk

(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)

First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
I don't want her if that ass don't sit like a horse
I be ballin' on these niggas, got me feelin' like sports
Dash got so much wood I could build me a fort
Ain't too many things I ain't done yet
I'm the king of this shit, crown by the toilet
I'm just barely gettin' started, you already upset
Got a tiger as a pet, I just took him to the vet
Homie, I be makin' hits, I'm the rap Derek Jeter
Let your bitch ride on me like she was on the feeder
If the pussy ain't good then I probably won't feed her
Lil homie, you can keep her cause I really don't need her
I ain't worried 'bout features, homeboy, you's a peon
Toilet seat ass nigga, man, I swear you gettin' peed on
Man, my jewelry so cold, I walk around with the heat on
My alarm clock set, just in case they wanna sleep on, ya dig?
I'm a full-time player, hoppin' out in alligator
Sippin' lean and Now and Later, homie, I'll annihilate ya
If you think you wanna battle, you gon' have to pay some paper
I just hit her and I quit her, I would never ever date her
It's a shame how I'm barely gettin' love in the city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fuckin' with me
I be killin' this shit, pray to God they forgive me
They said, ""when you blow up, don't forget me"", man
I been on fire ever since they made the lighter
My boys will pull up on ya, homie, I ain't talkin' diapers
Walk into your function, on point, I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like Dej Loaf so don't try her
Flexin' all you want but homeboy, you ain't ready
Ten times sharper than Michael Myers' machete
Been about the money, I ain't worried 'bout the fame
'Bout to have everybody sayin', ""Who Is Rickey Wayne?""
That me...

[Verse 1]
Yo, ayo tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we about to get lifted
Live in the present, that gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes though

[Pre-Chorus]
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's ok, we'll take our time

[Chorus]
The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we
The night is still young
(How dare we sit quietly)
The night is still young
(And watch the world pass us by)
The night is still young
(How dare we sit quietly)
And so are we

[Verse 2]
Ayo, drinks on you, or the drinks is on me
We ain't going nowhere like tanks is on E
We still getting money, what bank it's gon' be?
If he sexy, he planking on me
So when them big boys want all of that (Ay!)
Tell the bartender, say my order back (Ay!)
It's bottle service, he ordered that (Ay!)
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leaving 'till we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day
So drop the pop and get low
Or we can drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is don't lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's ok, we'll take our time

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse 1]
Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Verse 2]
Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you
And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel
Convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
(I am phenomenal)
And I want you to say that

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

[Bridge]
Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself
You’re floating freely, no emotion

[Verse 3]
Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement
Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say
You're a legend is makin' an allegation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Manage to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am

[Hook]
I am phenomenal
With every ounce of my blood
With every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal
I am phenomenal
However long that it takes
I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I am phenomenal
But I'll never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’
Cause I'm born to be phenomenal

She gotta say please (say please)
And I know they really wish we would ball 'til we fall
I'm the big bad wolf, it's a full moon, y'all
Toss the money in the air, girl
Watch how your dreams hit the floor
Wait 'til I get the buzz off this drug
Damn girl, you way too fine for a local club

So back to what I was saying
(Money make the world go 'round)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make your girl go down)
This could be us, but you're playing
(Money make the world go 'round)
I'm high, hope I don't sound crazy
(Money make your girl go down)
Fuck what them niggas was saying

This could be us, but you're playing

This could be us, but you're playing

Ba-Ba-Baby

I don't ever chase no hoes
I spotted you, you had that glo
Watch me pull out all this dough
Take you where you want to go
Flexin' on your ex, I know
He ain't ever take you out
Barely even left your house
How dare that nigga run his mouth
When his pockets in a drought
The last single he put out
Didn't even make it out
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, ayy
If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, ayy
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ayy
I got deep pockets, I swear my shit's on sink, ayy

Everybody tryna fuck you but I'm fine with that shit
I never mind, girl that's just you
I know you work hard for your shit
You know they gon' hate
Just don't play no part in that shit
They should call me James
Cause I'm goin' hard in this bitch
We're just so much smarter than them
Maybe I just needed you around me
Drank a lot tonight, I know
She can drive your car and you can roll
Take you where you wanna go
First off, I'ma start by sayin' this
Goddamn, goddamn

All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, Lord knows I'm filthy rich
All this ice is like 50 bricks
Rap niggas throwing hissy fits
I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift
And my bitch so bad, she on my Christmas list
'Member I prayed, really I wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I'm with some niggas that mad, we taking risks for this
I'm talking risky business, flick the wrist
Lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows if I get penned for this
I prolly won't get home until I'm 56
They say I'm the Messiah, you rappers is liars
I sign up at church just to rap at the choir
To spit my new verse at your wake while you're lying
The middle of the church have you wake, no I'm lying
I just came from jail, ain't do no crying
They put me through hell, sharpened my iron
I did my push-ups and I roared with the lions
Like hold up, from balling I'm tired
I'm back in this bitch and I'm back on my shit
Man they tell me be humble, I'm cocky as hell
Shout out my bitches that answered my calls
When I called you collect cause it got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail
It made me smarter and made me go harder
They locked me up and slowed my album up
But I did not give up cause I knew I would prevail
Came in the game, Philly as shit
Look at these rappers, they silly as shit
I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck 'em cause I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip
That I really done drove
Really was froze in my hood and these bitches I really did hit
Really was chose, came up from nothing
And now they like, ""How he made millions so quick?""
I'm in the back and it feel like a sofa
I done seen bitches I'm fuckin' on Oprah
In my new mansion I feel like I'm Sosa
A brick on the table ain't sniffing no coca, no way

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, niggas can't see me with binoculars on
Back of the Maybach, shottas on
And all my niggas keep choppers on
Don't reach round me, that's a chopper zone
Every time you be on count, what the topic on?
250 thou what I dropped it on
See y'all think it's a game 'til FOX be on
CNN, momma picking out boxes for 'em
I want everything, got my own boxers on
Own headphones to get my popping on
I got my own Pumas that I designed 'em for 'em
Stick and moving on these niggas, get my boxing on
All I ever hear from niggas is what they prolly doing
But they be really talkin' 'bout what I be doing
All black Rottweiler, that Givenchy on
Drop top Rolls Royce but the top is on
And the windows down like see y'all later
Mirror tint on that bitch so you could see y'all hating
Champagne cork pop like we all made it
Ya'll looking from the sideline we all hate it
Money don't make it real
Don't give a fuck if its 80 mil, pussy
And just cause you got a Bentley
That Bentley won't make you thorough, pussy
Still hating me from my city
I'm thinking is they for real, pussies
Cause all I got to say is kill
They'll come in like Navy Seals
That's word to my momma, I promise I ain't doing no block
And we shoot at you robbers and kill all you fuck niggas talking
Lately I've been on this money
Don't run it back up just to come and put you in a coffin
I heard you said you was running this city
I seen you in traffic and you was just walking
Niggas be popping that shit like they with it
When niggas start hitting all you did was talk it, you pussy

I had to grab the Wraith, I had to grab the Wraith
I had to change the safe, I had to change my bitch
Money'll change a nigga, the fame'll change a bitch
I know I came from poverty, I got my name from poverty
I know for sure, for sure
If my granddad was livin', I know he'd be proud of me
I know for sure, for sure
If Snupe was living, I know he'd be proud of me

[Verse 2]
I ran it up with the same niggas
Get that money and stay with the same niggas
I know that money can change niggas
They don't look at you like you the same nigga
I just hope I can remain humble
Hop out a Ghost in the jungle, I did it
Sell all the dope out them apartments, I did it
I'm 'bout to cut off some niggas I know that ain't with me
Runnin' with niggas that wanna see niggas
That get it and niggas who strive
And the real niggas is all they come across, yeah
I know either way it goes, Sunny gon' be there
I know either way it goes, Doe Boy gon' be there (Young Metro!)
Even when a nigga was broke, Scooter was always there
I be pourin' up this 4, they thought we wouldn't be here
I told you, come a time when we had to persevere
I knew there'd come a time when we'd all be here

I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe

You can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa, very important and very pretentious
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad ‘cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, ""Drizzy, tell 'em again!""
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you’d do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'...
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)

Stop, stop, stop...
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)
I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you

[Hook]
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitching on us without no interrogation
I stay silent ‘cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watching, I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up

[Verse 1]
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered man, in fact, I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are getting into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all coming, knew they would push a button
East egg hunting, they gotta look for something
Done doing favors for people
Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas having trouble going gold
Turning into some so and so’s that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Corey Joe
No woman ever had me star struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no we eating, niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up

[Verse 2]
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky legging
Trust me this information is vital
I’m trying to take the high road
I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s something that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We going live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killing people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up

Everytime I leave
Oh, I’m so sorry
(Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)

[Sample]
You know, I kept it real
It ain’t too many real people out here
And people be on some weak bitch ass shit all day long
Industry people....regular people...
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak

That I'll bless her with some grandkids, she can spoil them
Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta
Can a man live? And it's all day (homie)
I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get them all paid
Came a long way from all-state, yeah
Now we All-American, we All-American

I swear to God I put the hero in Heroin
These flows, kilos
I could sell snow to a ski slope
I could sell evil to the devil
Nonbelievers to a temple
Shit, I could sell water to a speedboat
And these eyes is iconic
I went pro, made profit
Now I keep some dead faces in my pocket
Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week
But what's a God without a little OD? Just a G
Twisting my weed, easing my mind
Why you worry about me?
Stop tripping, I'm fine
Swear these bitches done lost it lately
You put the ho in honest baby, so complicated
And I may be a little arrogant, I'm aware of it

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Straight outta Compton, crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)

[Interlude: Eazy E (MC Ren)]
Yo, Ren! (Whassup?)
Tell 'em where you from!

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
Straight outta Compton, another crazy ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're composed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, ‘cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum, and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, ‘cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(Straight outta Compton)

[Interlude: Dr. Dre]
Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming…

[Verse 3: Eazy E]
…Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(Straight outta Compton)

Damn, that shit was dope!

[Verse 1]
Cruisin' down the street in my 6-4
Jockin' the freaks, clockin' the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckle-heads out there cold-shootin' some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G
He rolled down his window and he started to say
It's all about makin' that GTA

[Hook]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

{Scratching}
Hey, old man!
Get the fuck out!
Pump that beat!
Mothafucker, say what?

[Verse 2]
Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said my man JD is on freebase
The boy JD was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal an Alpine
Chased him up the streets to call a truce
The silly cluckhead pulls out a deuce deuce
Little did he know I had a loaded 12-gauge
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

[Hook]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

{Scratching}
Yo, Leroy!
Beer drinkin', breath stinkin', sniffin' glue

[Verse 3]
Bored as hell and I wanna get ill
So I went to a place where my homeboys chill
The fellas out there makin' that dollar
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin'
And from the 8-ball my breath started stinkin'
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said somethin' that made me mad
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I threw a right cross, cold-knocked him out

[Hook]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

{Scratching}
Who do you think you are, Mr. big stuff?
Rock this mothafucker like Three the Hard Way

[Verse 4]
I'm rollin' hard, now I'm under control
Then wrapped my 6-4 around a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said ""Oh, brother.""
I throw it in the gutter, and go buy another
Walkin' home, I see the G ride
Now Cat is drivin', Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Cat got beat for resistin' arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doin' the crime
Fourth offense on the boy he'll do some time

[Hook]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

{Scratching}
L.A. playa
Big Drum Beater

[Verse 5]
I went to get them out, but there was no bail
The fellas causin' a riot in the county jail
Two days later in the municipal court
Kilo G on trial cold cut a fart
""Disruption of the court,"" said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge
Baliff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out ""Fire!"", then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the girl but didn't hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder

[Hook]
'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card
Knowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit

My niggas stack their money just to spend it, uh
Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
And if you ain't beefin' 'bout no money, then what's the problem? Uh
Don't worry about my niggas, ZooWap got 'em, uh

[Verse]
On everything, for 17 I'm wildin', ayy
Treat my whole squad on an island, ayy
Ziploc gang, bring a lighter, ayy
It's gon' be a house party on this island, ayy
Shit boom like M80s on this island
It's a lot of trillionaires throwin' dollars
Causin' pure hell, wildin' out on this island
I do this too swell, my pockets too swell
Come try the Hunned Gang, man they'll shoot ya
I do this for my squad, I do this for my gang
I do this for my squad, I do this for my gang
It’s Zoovie from the trap and ain't a damn thing change

[Hook]
My niggas stack their money just to spend it
Cause when you die, you cannot take it with you
If you ain't beefin' 'bout the money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas 'cause I got 'em, uh
My niggas stack their money just to spend it, uh
Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
And if you ain't beefin' 'bout no money, then what's the problem? Uh

I watched my broad give up on me like I'm average
I went back inside the attic, count it up and started laughing, ah
I went back inside the attic, count it up and started laughing, ah
Cuban links hanging on my wrist, I was on welfare
Wake up in the house I look up, I see bales everywhere
I see girls everywhere, I see scales everywhere
I see heron everywhere, I get mail everywhere
Walked inside the booth and came out in a Learjet
A fiend for that lean, I ain't started drinking beer yet
They bust the trap, I live there
Came out clean, I ain't clean, my nigga still there
Just imagine you was livin' lavish and they still there
Wake up in the crib, pools sitting on the hill now
I just need some niggas with me that's gon' keep it real now
Got a lot of pretty bitches, I just paid their bills now
Money make her feel good but damn she make me feel good
Known for getting that guala out in Europe but I'm still hood
Known to pop a bottle on a model, fuck her like I'm on my last damn dollar

This for my niggas on that bullshit and that nonsense
This for my dogs that go Karrueche with the chopsticks

We be talking lick talk, and I'ma fuck your bitch too
I ain't got no manners for no sluts
I'ma put my thumb in her butt

[Pre-Hook]
Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy
They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk

[Hook]
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us ‘cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

[Verse 2]
I'ma tell a lie under oath
I can see it in your eyes, you're going broke
Oxycontin got her with a body count (sak pase)
Riding in a car I barely can pronounce
Ordered up a chauffeur, told him, ""ride me round the whole world""
I was on the E-way with that molly and that old girl
Get a little cheaper, you could win
Hit it little harder, get the Benz

[Hook]
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk
I'm 'bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
'Bout to fuck this cash up on a new toy
You can't understand us ‘cause you're too soft
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

[Bridge]
Fully loaded whip tote fully loaded clips
Fucking with my niggas, I'll smoke a zip
Red eyes, and I got them Zoes with me
Taliban bands, run 'em straight through the machinery

[Pre-Hook]
Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy
They say my whole hood got it under investigation
They know they talk that stick talk, that stick talk
They know we talk that lick talk, that lick talk

[Hook]
10 million dollars cash, fuck a friend
Started sipping syrup, I've been geeked ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
Gotta keep that heat on the seat ever since
You know we talk that stick talk, that stick talk

Diamonds really diamonds
And I'm shining bright ‘cause I'm really grindin'
They ask me if I'm real, I say, ""Is you serious?""
My daughter gon' love this bitch here

[Hook]
All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say, ""Really really""
Got money on my mind, I say, ""Really really""
I look like I been ballin' ‘cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lyin', I say, ""Really really""
I'm really out my mind, I say, ""Really really""
Really really

[Verse 1]
Make 'em believe, I made 'em believe
A lyrical song writer and he can sing
Bringing in money like raking in leaves
I was just trying to get paper to sneeze
Achoo, that was a blessing
She special to you, I don't look at her special
Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
Gates had her first then he gave her to Kevin
All the above, we do all the et cetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular
He talking reckless, don't call me back ever
Passing through Gardere to holler at Glover
Shout out to Black, shout out to Cedric
Grey Monte Carlo, cocaine 911
Just hollered at Trav, I'm like the Reverend
My section ridiculous, watch where you steppin'
Pockets on indigent, can't be too careful
Steve like 'em tall and when they yellow
Broke and in college, fresh with low mileage
I like 'em black, pretty white teeth
Body unique, booty on fleek
Jhené Aiko, chewing her cheeks
Groceries, please, you know that was me

[Hook]
All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say, ""Really really""
Got money on my mind, I say, ""Really really""

Really really

[Verse 2]
Diving be treacherous (Swim)
Pray to God that don't nobody mess with us (Him)
Keep it strong in case anyone testing us
Right or wrong, if it's this, you don't mess with it
When yo' bitch over here I don't mess with her
No detective work, I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man, that's irregular
Take her phone, disconnectin' her cellular
What you need that for undressin' her?
What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual, it's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets, smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly, check out my etiquette
Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it
Carats, they glisten in all of my necklaces
Feeling myself, really thought it was evident

[Hook]
All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say, ""Really really""
Got money on my mind, I say, ""Really really""
I look like I been ballin' ‘cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry

All my niggas ballin'
All my niggas athletic
All my niggas A1
All got street cred
All my niggas ballin'
All my niggas athletic
Pulled up in the Phantom
Pulled off with a dancer
Got a pocket full of money
Kinda hard to keep my pants up
Nigga tryna run them bands up
Fuck a bitch with my hands up
Lil Quay fucked the Xans up
Kinda hard to understand us
Duffle bags in the Escalade
Call the bitch there a bread truck
Got the bitch going retarded
Call Uber for a spare truck
All these niggas never scared us
All these niggas never ran up
Bitch tryna put the head on me
Niggas tryna put the feds on me
Niggas tryna take meds on me
Everything for the players only
Niggas sunny like Arizona
Gunshots just for sayin' something
Spraying shit like aerosol
You a foul and that's a fair ball
Nigga can't reach the goals
Keep shootin' a damn air ball

Watch out, lil ho
My partners still smoke on parole
They say that I'm crazy
I used to talk to a stove
I tell it to lock, shit I tell it a lot
Go to the dealership, fishtail off the lot
You know I'm comin' straight out the block
You know I'm comin' straight out the top
Shawty said she want 5 million
'Cause I told her to leave and call her a thot
Shit, you can like it or not, damn
I'm comin' straight out the pot, yam
Still got some ACT in my stock, man
Nigga I ain't gotta lie
Nigga I ain't gotta try
You wavin' that thing in the sky
We wavin' that thing at your body
We wavin' that thing at your eye
Look at the watch on my wrist
Got 'em all watchin' my wrist
Told that lil bitch I'll pass
Nigga watch the assist (swish)
I run the trap like the marathon
You niggas softer than silicone
You know what it's like when the feelin' gone
I know what it's like when the ceilin' gone
I had a sit down with Farrakhan
Turn the White House to the Terror Dome
I used to serve at the Chevron
I used to serve with my necklace on, bitch

Watch out, lil bitch

Button start the foreign, oh my God I'm gorgeous
I just put the key inside my pocket
Park it, might not get to see it, this a new Ferrari
Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything I get returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded
Keep the oil cause I am not using the Foreman
Kitchen, I just finished up a new performance
Hater, wish you well

I just got it off the scale

There they go again, one of my lil friends
They don't give a damn how a nigga been
All they wanna know is what I got to give
How much did I spend? What I got to lend?
What I did and what I didn't do for them
Bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Droppin' bottles spend hustlin' I'm supplin' 10
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern
One day you gone learn what you tryna get
Everything on sale, goin' out of biz
Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
Juggin' round the city, you know what it is
Bread winner business, put that on the wrist

Ring, ring, ringin' man
Find me balling hard
Come from grinding hard
Getting calling cards from your Barbie doll
When she round me she know I'm her bodyguard
Money callin' for me, baby girl I'm sorry
You just high yella you not that important
Weight, shape her, I could pin you to the carpet
Smell like tartar, I'mma put you in the water
Conversation cost a lot of chips
She don't really get a lot of this
Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient
Phone ringing, hold up, what it is?

To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try and say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those are strings that you can’t pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth

You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave y'all the whole money play and y'all broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, Now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying

Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah, so trust me, they’ll be out here…

Got 'em suckin', takin' bars, now they screamin' team litty
Whoa, whoa

You get penalized, you come around, It ain't enough dough
Keep a bag of xannies if you tryna join the family
Got the sauce on me and it's off-white tanny
Puerto rican freakin' oh she sneakin', I done ordered up
She was goin' in the spur like a party bus
Pardon me, before I take a greed I never brag or boast
She ain't speak no inglo, but I know she like to tweak that coke

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Look at my dab, everybody sayin' dab
Trap niggas on the map, trap niggas like to dab
Trap niggas in the bowl, trap niggas on the stove
Trap niggas worldwide, play with the power with no eyes
Dabbin' goin' in the dictionary, birds sangin' just like Mary Mary
The bricks got wings like the tooth fairy, pinky ring yellow canary
Touchdown on the Pack and I run it like Barry
Migo like Ed, Edd and Eddy
You mad 'bout your hoe but that's petty
Spray the chopper like confetti
Look at my dab, got me feelin' like I'm Fab
Look at my dab, spreadin' dab across the map
I'm dabbin' when I walk up in the trap
I look at the pot, I'm like ""get in there!""
I play with the water need swimwear
Look at my dab, get in there!

Get in there, get in there
Got me dabbin', Yung Rich Nation gear
Lookin' like I'm not from around here
Young nigga dabbin' out the atmosphere
You niggas still sayin' swag
My niggas switched it up we call it dab
Step out with a light dab I call it a jab
Michael Jordan I'm perfecting my craft
No money counter, count it up with my hands
Young nigga, I can show you how to do math
Sippin' on drank, I pour up some muddy
My nigga not tryin' to remember my past
Don't come to my hood if you ain't got a pass
Eat up the dab like linguini and crab
Mr. McMahon, I fire you and your staff
Watchin' you niggas dabbin' made me laugh
Dabbin' is a way of fashion, touchdown like I'm Takeoff McFadden
Call a play like I'm Takeoff John Madden
Should get a platinum plaque from all this dabbin'
You niggas should get a Grammy, the way you actin'
Enough of that swag I put it in a casket
Look at my dab, yo bitch droppin' her panties
I feel fantastic, immaculate dabbin'
Stay off my grass, call me Takeoff Stanley

[Outro: Takeoff]
So now niggas dabbin'
Before it was swaggin'
Nigga thinkin' that it's just a dance
When dabbin' is a way of fashion
See I'm tryin' to teach y'all the rules and regulations
Cause there's a lot of niggas out here perpetrating
No temptations, Migos sensation
Seen a lot of faces, why not make a Young Rich Nation

And stack my change up and go see the jeweler
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work
Standin' in the kitchen I whip up that work

[Verse 1]
All I ever had was the cocaine
My cousin Leeroy was the dope man
And GT switchin' four lanes
On the stove whip the coke up like propane
On the block where the shots go ""bang!""
Only real niggas really gon' hang
All my life, you was saved by the bell
I was saved by the cocaine, ay!
Young boys with choppers, young boys with lawyers
We stand in the kitchen and whip out that work

[Verse 2]
Got the trap house bumpin'
First in the month where the kids run
Got the whole block jumping on fire
Name on ring when I come through
Addicted to moolah, no favors
This feel like a hell of a day bro
I'm falling in love with that coco
Shit run in my veins and my whole soul
Got the whole block in a choke hold
Middle finger to the popo
Cool is so coola, addicted to moolah

Soon as that work hit the city, we move it

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas, mad snakes
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrived
Don't be sleeping on your level cause it's beauty in the struggle nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle nigga
(Let me explain)
It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block
Man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better

[Verse 2]
For what's money without happiness?
Or hard times without the people you love
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick, do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of living with demons
Cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes
That's fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours

So why send oppression not blessings?
Why, oh why'd you do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
(To save) Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light
(War) To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that you'll make everything alright
And I know that you'll take good care of your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
When they come for you, I will shield your name
I will field their questions, I will feel your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know

Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted Pangaea
I'm moving all my family  from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina

Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap  photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made Sunday Candy, I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said let's do a good ass job with Chance three
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride I'ma still give them raincoats
Know what God said when he made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th

I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn I forgot to call her, shit I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry?

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
Tell me you want your tickets when it's gametime
Even to call your daughter on her FaceTime
Even when we was young I used to make time
Now we be way too busy just to make time
Even for my...

[Hook: Kanye West, Kanye & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I?
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was
Couldn't tell you how old your son is
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg
Plus I already got one kid
Couldn't tell you much about the fam though
I just showed up for the yams though
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit?
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit
Cause everybody got 'em, that ain't children
Oh you've been nothin' but a friend to me
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy
Money turn your kin into an enemy
Niggas ain't real as they pretend to be

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Ty Dolla $ign]
Lookin' for all my real friends
How many of us? How many of us are real friends
To real friends, 'til the reel end
'Til the wheels fall off, 'til the wheels don't spin
To 3 A.M., callin'
How many real friends?
Just to ask you a question
Just to see how you was feelin'
How many?
For the last you was frontin'
I hate when a nigga text you like, ""What's up, fam? Hope you good""
You say, ""I'm good, I'm great,"" the next text they ask you for somethin'
How many?
What's best for your family, immediate or extended
Any argument, the media'll extend it
I had a cousin that stole my laptop that I was fuckin' bitches on
Paid that nigga 250 thousand just to get it from him
Real friends
Huh?

[Hook: Kanye West,  Kanye & Ty Dolla $ign]
Real friends
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Word on the streets is they ain't heard from him
I guess I get what I deserve, don't I
Talked down on my name, throwed dirt on him

[Verse 1]
Lighting stog after stog, and choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
Help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha, ha
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck

[Verse 2]
Push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know whats about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go...

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck

Knowing all of this
It just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen

Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Ok now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But off verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Hook: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me, I'm just dunning the hype
Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

[Verse 2: Drake]
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Hook: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again

Did it, did it, did it by myself, by myself, dog
Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

[Verse 1]
How did I finesse all of this shit from Jane and Weston?
Girls all in my bed and they don't trip off first impressions
Girls all in your bed and they just ask a hundred questions
I can't fuck with you no more cause you be actin' extra
Do your favorite rapper like my son, like my son though
Nothing mutual about my funds, 'bout my funds though
All you niggas fightin' over crumbs, where the bread at?
How they feel about you
Where you're from, where your bed at?
I don't need no pill to speak my mind, I don't need that
I make people pay me for my time, yeah, I need that
And I see your girl like all the time, all the time though
I can't tell you if she's yours or mine but I do know

Blew up and I'm in the city still, I'm still here, dog

[Verse 2]
Oh and I'm back, dog
Oh, you just went and turned your back, dog
I thought that we were family
You showed me that we can't be
I gotta talk to God even though He isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that He don't hear me
Hittin' like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
6-point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the doors open and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

Me and all my niggas doin' well, doin' well, dog
You not from the city, I could tell, I could tell, dog

[Intro: DMX]
What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Verse 1]
On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

[Hook]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
It's like a lot of games are bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You send the ""Are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

[Hook]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 3]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit

Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line
So they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace
But I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go
I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'mma start telling niggas ""Get it how you can""
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night that I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you

Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side

Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza
Cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, ""What are those?""
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk of the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t how it always seems when it’s so together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want—yeah, that's right, yeah

[Intro]
Yeah, I get it
I get it, yeah

[Verse 1]
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?—I lost my way

[Chorus]
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you (think about me)
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah

[Verse 3]
Say to you—but 80 percent of it was the truth, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now

[Verse 4]
Damn
I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
It's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough
And then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

Yeah
I know

[Intro]
It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Hook]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet and now we're meeting our end

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that

[Hook]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

[Outro]
Anytime people want to start problems
It's like “for real, are you dumb?”
You know who mans are
I'm not afraid no gyal heart man
And I'm not afraid of no cyattie
And I'm not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it
Seh feh

They throwin' dirt on my old name
Only gets worse when you know things
You don't see the perks of this whole thing
But you get real on a pill and I like it
You just like my sidekick, I just wanna wife
Fulfill all your desires
Keep you in the front, never in the back
And never on the side, yeah

[Chorus 1]
You a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

[Verse 2]
Look, you know I'm a rider, nothin' left to hide
Your other nigga tired
Talk about you like you never leave his side
But I don't really buy it
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'
Let's just keep it private (Don't say anything)
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?
Cause we never decided
Tell me how you feel inside

[Chorus 2]
You a real ass woman and I like it, yeah
Dedicate to you
I need you inspired, I need you excited
I don't wanna fight it

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I figure out you, you figure out me
We both a different breed
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need
You say, ""A guarantee""
I mean, you say that like it's easy
You never believe me
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on 'em
Girl, I'm sleepy
Sometimes I'm so indecisive

[Chorus 1]
But you a real ass woman and I like it
I don't wanna fight it

[Outro]

Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
""It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait""
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

[Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either

Biggest boss and I've been the trillest
I'm a bigger problem when I click with Skrillex
Murder on my mind, it's time to pray to God
My revolver's not religious, the revolution’s born
You wanna know my name then go and tell the serg'
You wanna know my gang: Suicide Squad
Pistol on my waist, I might make a mistake
Deadshot, head shot, oh my God, am I crazy?
Drugs every corner, this is Gotham City
Killer Croc came to kidnap you to cut out your kidney
Ain't no mercy, got that purple Lamborghini lurkin'
Rozay, don't you know that pussy worth it?
Flooded Rolex at the Grammy awards
They still sellin' dope, that's those Miami boys
Killers everywhere, it ain't no place to run
Forgive me for my wrongs, I have just begun

Ain't no mercy, a-ain't no mercy

Don't be beggin' for your life 'cause that's a lost cause
High stakes, body armor, suicide, boy
It's a time for games and it's a time to kill
Make up your mind, baby, 'cause the time is here
Capital murder, capital letters
Yeah, she catchin' my vibe, but she can't fathom my cheddar
Need a couple gang members for these new endeavors
From this point on anything we do we do together
Body on the corner, million in the trunk
Seven figures, I spend that every other month
Killers on the corner, talons in the clip
Build a palace out in Paris just to fill with bitches
Say my name and I’m coming with the gun squad
Everybody runnin', homie, there’s only one God
Cocaine white Ferrari, I'm in the fast lane
Every day was life and death, that's when the cash came
Count money, drug residue, even blood on ‘em
He had a driver 'til I put my cuz on it
Kickin' in the door, boy, Suicide Squad
Needle in my arm so I'm do or die for it

And perfect's for the urgent

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Verse 1]
I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016
And I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
""I been with you since day one
Savage I ain't even hatin'""
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
""Savage I was just playin'""
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'
Bitch I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
""Come on man, Savage you know I always play your mixtape""
Yeah, nigga fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he wrappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up
Niggas actin' like groupies, they don't know us
Little do they know their bitches fuckin' on the tour bus

[Intro]
Yeah, more, yeah

[Verse]
More time with family and friends, more life
More time to get it right
It's only me, but I'm seeing four shadows in the light
My demons visit me every night
To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'
I put it all in the music
Because if I don't say it here, then I won't say nothin'
Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'
Too reserved, like I called ahead for me and my lady
Free C5, how the fuck we got the boss waiting?
Ever since the blue basement, I found God and I lost patience
Between rocks and hard places of all places
Spotted everywhere, like Dalmatian
Cops snoop around now, 'cause all of my dogs famous
Please welcome the October fall baby
Vaughan Road Academy, star player—my mind's not all there
Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now
All Stacy Adams and linnen'd out
More blessings for Sandy and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups
On this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a ""not guilty""
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid
That never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, ""This what we need to be on,"" but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is
Me, I don't judge, I'm just going off what the math is
Numbers inflated
They all look at me, like, ""What have you done for me lately?""
""I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest.""
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest
Then give you tropical flavours
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

We don't believe you 'cause we the people
Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you
You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole
Trendsetter, I know, my shit's cold
Ain't settling because I ain't so bold but ay

[Hook: Q-Tip]
All you Black folks, you must go
All you Mexicans, you must go
And all you poor folks, you must go
Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways
So all you bad folks, you must go

The fog and the smog of news media that logs
False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds
We're not just nigga rappers with the bars
It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars

[Verse 2: Phife Dawg]
You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians
Fuck y'all know about true competition?
That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'
The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
Boy, I tell you that's vision
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten
The Tribe be the best in they division
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block
Babylon, bloodclaat
Two pon yuh headtop

[Hook: Q-Tip]
All you Black folks, you must go
All you Mexicans, you must go
And all you poor folks, you must go

She feel like the ocean
Like to drink and smoke some doja
And I feel like smokin'
Plus she good at charmin' cobras
I feel like I'm chosen
But she ain't the only one, no
Got a chick, I call her Katia
She be actin' bougie

Who's pullin' strings, I'm just pointing out all the puppets
What I'm demanding is fucking up all the budgets
I'm smart as fuck, they be talkin' like I'm the dumbest
But I know what they want from me
Dollars, lotta stock in me
It ain't nothin' personal, it's business and I'm a commodity

Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

[Verse 1]
Yeah, life is a balance
You lose your grip, you can slip into an abyss
No doubt, you see these niggas trippin'
Ego in charge of every move, he's a star
And we can't look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
He's fallin' apart, but we deny it
Justifying that half ass shit he dropped, we always buy it
When he tell us he a genius but it's clearer lately
It's been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
There was a time when this nigga was my hero, maybe
That's the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
'Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
The type of nigga swear he real but all around him's fake
The women, the dickriders, you know, the yes men
Nobody with the balls to say somethin' to contest him
So he grows out of control
Into the person that he truly was all along, it's startin' to show
Damn, wonder what happened
Maybe it's my fault for idolizin' niggas
Based off the words they be rappin'
But come to find out, these niggas don't even write they shit
Hear some new style bubblin' up, then they bite this shit
Damn, that's what I get for lyin' to myself
Well, fuck it, what's more important is he's cryin' out for help
While the world's eggin' him on, I'm beggin' him to stop it
Playin' his old shit, knowin' he won't top it

I got a homie, he a rapper and he wanna win bad
He want the fame, the acclaim, the respect that's been had
By all the legends, so every time I see him, he stressin'
Talkin' 'bout, niggas don't fuck with him, this shit is depressin'
And I know he so bitter he can't see his own blessings
Goddamn, nigga, you too blind to see you got fans, nigga
And a platform to make a classic rap song
To change a nigga's life, but you too anxious livin' life
Always worried 'bout the critics who ain't ever fuckin' did it
I write what's in my heart, don't give a fuck who fuckin' with it
But in a sense I can relate, the need to be great
Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
Writin' words, hopin' people observe the dedication
That stirs in you constantly, but intentions get blurred
Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me?
Do I want these niggas to worship me?

[Verse 3]
These rappers insecure
They talk about being a man so much
I finally understand that they ain't even sure
'Bout who they are and why they do this
Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
My highest moments come from tellin' all the saddest stories
I've seen in my life, I be fiendin' to write
Songs that raise the hair on my arms
My lowest moments came from tryin' too hard
To impress some niggas that couldn't care if I'm on
Therefore from here on out, my hair grow out
I care nothin' 'bout opinions
I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
Hit the store, take your diss, make your wish
This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
I'm on some thankful shit
But the real God is in you, not the music you coppin'
I hear my old shit and know I can top it
False prophets

[Hook]
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this, be like this
False prophets (La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la…)
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Be like this, be like this
Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
Yeah, false prophets

[Intro]
Awwwww...haha

[Verse 1]
Now I was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
Screamin' ""dollar and a dream"" with my closet lookin' broke
And my nigga's lookin' clean, gettin' caught up with that dope
Have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap?
Nigga I can tell you things that you probably shouldn't know
Have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor?
Flashbacks to the pain, wakin' up, cold sweats
Six o'clock in the mornin', gotta hit the BowFlex
Get my weight up on the block, keep watch for the cops
God they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
Nowadays crime pays like a part time job
And the drought got me prayin' for a Carl Thom vibe
Summer Rain come again
Numb the pain 'cause it's hard for a felon
In my mind I been cryin', know it's wrong but I'm sellin'
Eyes wellin' up with tears
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas dead in the dirt
Immortalized on this shirt

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon?
Have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon?
Have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry?
Have you ever seen a motherfuckin' ribbon in the sky?
Nope, all I see is that C.R.E.A.M nigga, that green
I'm a black king, black jeans on my black queen
And her ass fat, too fat for a flat screen
I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend
If they want a nigga, they gon' have to send a SWAT team
And I'm goin' out like Scarface in his last scene
A legend, what that mean—?

[Hook]
Real niggas don't die
Forward with the plot
One-Seven-Forty-Five
Form at the plot
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Hood niggas don't lie
Form in the plot
My niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Form on the block
Real niggas don't die
Real niggas don't die

[Outro]
To die a young legend or live a long life unfulfilled
'Cause you wanna change the world
But while alive you never will
'Cause they only feel you after you gone, or I've been told
And now I'm caught between bein' heard and gettin' old
Damn, death creepin' in my thoughts lately
My one wish in this bitch, ""Make it quick if the Lord take me""
I know nobody meant to live forever anyway
And so I hustle like my niggas in Virgini-A
They tellin' niggas, ""sell dope, rap or go to NBA,"" (in that order)
It's that sort of thinkin' that been keepin' niggas chained
At the bottom and hanged
The strangest fruit that you ever seen
Ripe with pain, listen...

I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
Apologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream as I write this
The team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' ""You do you and I do me""
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

[Hook]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm—neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Verse 2]
Some things you can't escape:
Death, taxes, and a ra-
-cist society that make
Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang
Only time they see us we be on the news, in chains, damn

[Bridge]
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
Don't follow me

[Hook]
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
Hm, I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
The neighbors think I'm...neighbors think I'm—
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
(Don't follow me, don't follow me...)
I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Well motherfucker, I am

[Outro]
I am, I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
I think the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope
I am, I am, I am
Well, motherfucker, I am
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side
So much for integration
Don't know what I was thinkin'
I'm movin' back to south side

[Intro]
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah
My intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I like this tone

[Verse 1]
Yeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days
I sit in silence and find whenever I meditate
My fears alleviate, my tears evaporate
My faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date
But see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath
Bringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step
As we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die
Most niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified
It's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, God, I'm overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)
As if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
See I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man
Because He knows us all and therefore He would understand
The ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
The bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

[Hook]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 2]
Yeah, my chosen religion
Jesus piece frozen from sinnin'
Doin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions
To see a million 'fore I see a casket
I got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard
I'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste
When I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates
Niggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank
Know I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo
Right now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
For my ability to make them birds fly
Fiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view
And who am I to tell a nigga what to do?
I just supply, it's economics
My business ain't got the suit and tie
Keep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine
I can't oblige, dog, I work too hard
So reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga

[Hook]
I know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—
In cemeteries or in chains I see men cry
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from inside
But the only real change come from—

[Verse 3]
Yeah, prodigal son, got a new gun
This one don't run out of ammo
Lately been working on my handles
Can I ball, become a star and remain my self?
If I fall, dust it off and regain my self
Fuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt
I'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved
I no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing

[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]
Life is all about the evolution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
You can dream but don't neglect the execution
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Time is short that's what somebody told me
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more
Too short to keep following your homies
I give up, I give in, I move back a little
I live up, I look up, now I'm back for more

[Bridge]
I reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
All of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
Finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
What it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man
Eyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels
Niggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills
Bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
I call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)
That's how you feel?

[Verse 4]
Pistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat
Scattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete
A body laid on the concrete
Look, somebody laid on the concrete
No time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too
I made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news
Overcame with a feeling I can't explain
Cause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22
(Last night at around...) He was 22
(22 year old black male, suspect, poor...)

[Outro]
(I swear to God bruh)
We're gathered here today...
(I swear to God)
To mourn the life of James McMillan Jr
(I swear to God—nigga, I'mma kill them niggas man)
A tragedy, another tragedy in the black community
(I promise you bro...)
We got to do better, people
22 years old, this boy was too young
(I promise you bro, I'mma kill them niggas yo...)
Our condolences go to his family, our prayers
(I'mma kill them niggas myself...)
We know he's in a better place
We know he's in a better place
But this has got to end, ladies and gentleman
We've got to come together, this is—this is beyond words
Now I'd like to open this ceremony with a verse fro—

[Intro]
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive (I never felt so alive)

[Interlude]
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry
And I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die (Don't wanna die no more)
'Cause now you're here and I just wanna be
Right by your side
On any night that you be crying, baby
I'll dry your eyes
I'll dry your eyes

[Verse]
Every time you go to sleep you look like you in Heaven
Plus the head game is stronger than a few Excedrin
You shine just like the patent leather on my new 11's
You read me like a book like I'm the Bible, you the Reverend
Yeah, I wanna tell the truth to you
I wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
Exposing you to all my demons and the reasons I'm this way
I would like to paint a picture, but it'll take more than a day
It would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
Preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
The same wall that's stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
From the lack of having father, and the passing of my peers
While I'm too scared to expose myself
It turns out, you know me better than I know myself
Better than I know myself
Well how 'bout that?

[Outro]
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
She gets him (you get me)
She hugs him (you kiss me)
You tell me you miss me
And I believe you, I believe you
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time

Should come as no surprise

I'm searching and praying and hoping for something
I know I'm gon' see it, I know that it's coming
Lord, Lord
But what do you do when there's no place to turn?
I have no one, I'm lonely, my bridges have burnt down
Lord, Lord
The bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high
Ain't no way to live, do I wanna die?
I don't know, I don't know
Bells getting loud, ain't nowhere to hide
Got nowhere to go, put away my pride
Tired of feeling low even when I'm high

How long can I survive with this mentality?
How long can I survive with this mentality?
Things fall down, but don’t stop now
Oh, can’t stop now
Oh, won’t stop now

[Verse]
Trials and tribulations I'm facing
In this age of information, I hate this shit
Cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
Bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
Damn it, won't be long 'fore I disappear
You call it runnin', I call it escapin'
Start a new life in a foreign location
Similar to my niggas duckin' cases
Can't take the possible time that he faces

My dad, he died—he got shot 'cause his friend set him up. And I didn't go to his funeral—and sometimes when I'm in my room, I get mad at my momma when she mean to me. And she—
And she say, ""clean up""—I say—

Things fall down, but don’t stop now

For your eyes only (For your eyes)
For your eyes only, for your eyes only
(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Hey, niggas be dying on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me
Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the  moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
But these felonies be making life the hardest
Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
If you hearing this, unfortunately means
That I'm no longer with you in the physical
Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me praying that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
Blood was staining the concrete
Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinking:
""What the fuck we naming this girl?""
I told her ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap
This crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm living fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand

[Hook: J. Cole]
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated
'Cause the cash running out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized
My definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops
Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked
In a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person
Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only

[Hook: CharGaux & J. Cole]
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling
What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling
I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chilling, he said:
""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothing, when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?""
He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been having premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm living on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leaving you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With 'lil Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later, making sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first
To get some pussy twelve years old
Not because he used to come through
In the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from bagging up
Them grams to serving O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law""
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you
For your eyes only

Feel so much better than the wrong things
I wanna fold clothes for you

[Verse 1]
I wanna fold clothes for you
Woke up this morning
Feeling like the best version of me, so happy
I walked in the living room
And saw you all alone on the couch, just napping
I, I see a lot on your plate
Nine months with that weight
I know you tired so I wonder how I can help
I get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
Oh, I wanna fold clothes for you

Listen, this is a meditation for me
A practice in being present
There's nowhere I need to be
Except right here with you
Except right here with you
Folding clothes
Watching Netflix
Catching up on our shows
Eating breakfast
Raisin Bran in my bowl
With bananas and some almond milk
I never thought I'd see the day
I'm drinking almond milk

If I can make life easier
The way you do mine
Save you some time
Alleviate a bit of stress from your mind
Help you relax
Let you recline babe
Then I should do it
Cause Heaven only knows
How much you have done that for me
Now I see
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
That say ""I love you""
It's the simple things
It's the simple things
It's the simple things

[Verse 3]
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
We the ones that got to wear our face backwards
Put your frown on before they think you soft
Never smile long or take your defense off
Acting tough so much, we start to feel hard
Live from the city where they pull cards
I got a Glock 40 and a little nine
Ready for the day a nigga pull mine
Niggas from the hood is the best actors
Gotta learn to speak in ways that's unnatural
Just to make it through the job interviews
If my niggas heard me, they'd say
""Damn, what's gotten into you?""
Just trying to make it, dog, somehow
Peaking through the blinds, I see the sun now
I see you're still sleeping and it feels like
Maybe everything is gon' be alright

[Intro]
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, don't you
Catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time

[Bridge]
For you I drop the tough guy shit, on this bus I sit
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Thinking 'bout you, thinking 'bout you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you
Damn it feel good to have you

[Verse 1]
Needin' me, wantin' me, givin' me a chance to feel special
To somebody in a world where they not lovin' me
Handcuffs keep huggin' the, wrists of my niggas
And I wish stuff was different here
But if I had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
That means that there would be no Santa Claus no more
To bring you Christmas cheer
'Cause what he represents is really greed
And the need to purchase shit from corporations
That make a killin' because they feed
On the wallets of the poor who be knockin' on they door
Every Black Friday just to get some shit they can't afford
Even with the discount, write a check, that shit bounce
But as long as we got credit, it don't matter, the amount
We just swipin' shit here, we don't love, we just likin' shit here
What's that smell? Where's your diaper shit here?
Lay on your back, don't pee right now
Or else I'll have to get you back
One day when you gon' want to get your way
Yeah I'll have fun with that
Reminisce when you came out the womb
Tears of joy I think filled up the room
You are now the reason that I fight
I ain't never did nothing this right in my whole life
Got me thinking...

[Bridge]
Am I worthy of this gift?
Am I strong enough to lift? (Am I strong enough to lift?)
Into a place that I can see (Into a place that I can see)
Someone more important than me? (Someone more important than me?)
Am I worthy of this gift? (Am I worthy of this gift?)
Am I strong enough to lift (Am I strong enough to lift)
Into a place that I can see (Into a place that I can see)
Someone more important than me? (Someone more important than me?)

[Verse 2]
Ib gon' ask me how I did this shit
I'm gon' do a humble stunt act like I meant this shit
Thats the ego taking credit for what God made
Fuck this album shit, hey mama look what God made
(She's mine) Catch me, don't you
(She's mine) Catch me, don't you
(She's mine) Catch me
I've fallen in love for the first time
I wanna cry, and I ain't even tryna fight it
Don't wanna die, 'cause now you're here
And I just wanna be right by your side
On any night that you be cryin', baby
I dry your eyes, I dry your eyes

[Outro]
There is a God, it is a God
Yeah, it is a God
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
I never felt so alive
(I never felt so alive)
I never felt so alive
(I never felt so alive)
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, don't you—
Catch me, I've fallen in love for the first time

[Intro]
Yeah, we back
Back in Mohammed crib, nigga, top floor
The back room with just the one little small window, nigga
The light be comin' through it in the morning
Old-ass walls and shit
But it's just like I remember, just like I wanted it
Yeah, I'm workin'
Yeah, I'm workin', nigga

[Verse]
Look, it's the return of the Mr. Burn Suckers
Not herpes infested, just perfectly blessed with
A style that you can't F with, protection recommended
‘Cause Cole the definition of a weapon that can end it
You know, mass destruction when I mash the button
I take your favorite major rapper, left him independent
Cryin' in the corner
‘Cause I ain't into sorta kinda, dissin' niggas
I'm borderline addicted to slaughter
Line up niggas in order
Of who you think can really fuck with me most
Then I tuck the heat close, if he don't duck then he ghost
Ain't no need for discussion
If they weren't talking 'bout the bread
These motherfuckers be toast
Clap at the fake deep rappers
The OG gatekeep rappers
The would-you-take-a-break-please rappers
Bunch of words and ain't sayin' shit, I hate these rappers
Especially the amateur eight week rappers
Lil' whatever—just another short bus rapper
Fake drug dealers turn tour bus trappers
Napoleon complex, you this tall rappers
Get exposed standin' next to 6'4"" rappers
The streets don't fuck with you, you Pitchfork rappers
Chosen by the white man, you hipster rappers
I reload the clip, then I hit more rappers with that
Straight shittin' on these piss-poor rappers, I'm back
Never knew a nigga that was better
Revenue, I'm good at gettin' cheddar
Reminisce on days I didn't eat
If it's meant to be, then it'll be
If it's not, then fuck it, I'ma try
Ain't no need to ask the Father why, no
‘Cause one day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, oh
One day everybody gotta die
One day everybody gotta die, my nigga, my nigga
