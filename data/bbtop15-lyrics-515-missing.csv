[Intro]
""What'll we get for 10 dollars?""
""Every 'ting you want""
""Everything?""
""Every 'ting..""

[Hook]
Ahh! Me so horny!
Me love you long time!

[Verse 1: Brother Marquis]
Sitting at home with my dick on hard
So I got the black book for a freak to call
Picked up the telephone, then dialed the 7 digits
Said, ""Yo, this Marquis, baby! Are you down with it?""
I arrived at her house, knocked on the door
Not having no idea of what the night had in store
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning
I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fresh Kid Ice]
Girls always ask me why I fuck so much
I say ""What's wrong, baby doll, with a quick nut?""
Cause you're the one, and you shouldn't be mad
I won't tell your mama if you don't tell your dad
I know he'll be disgusted when he sees your pussy busted
Won't your mama be so mad if she knew I got that ass?
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning
My appetite is sex, cause me so horny

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Brother Marquis]
You can say I'm desperate, even call me perverted
But you say I'm a dog when I leave you fucked and deserted
I'll play with your heart just like it's a game
I'll be blowing your mind while you're blowing my brains
I'm just like that man they call Georgie Puddin' Pie
I fuck all the girls and I make 'em cry
I'm like a dog in heat, a freak without warning
I have an appetite for sex, cause me so horny

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Fresh Kid Ice]
It's true, you were a virgin until you met me
I was the first to make you hot and wetty-wetty
You tell your parents that we're going out
Never to the movies, just straight to my house
You said it yourself, you like it like I do
Put your lips on my dick, and suck my asshole too
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning
My appetite is sex, cause me so horny

[Outro]

Ladies and gentlemen
The Kit-Kat Club is proud to present
Something new, something different
So would you please give a warm welcome to
The Rhythm

Well I came here for something funky to happen
Is this Christmas cuz everybody's rappin
You better get sparked by the song that I sing
Although my name ain't Martin Luther
But I'm considered the king
Yo, my beats pumped by the mic I clamp
I don't need an amplifier
My brain is the amp
I got the beats to make you tingle
Make your body mingle
Like you got the fever for the flavor of a Pringle
Weak I say not so
I'm just like Picasso
A pioneer
I am here
Ask me how I got so fly
Any sense that I can give 'em
A New Beginning Stevie-o
And my dope rythm
I sent the Lord master give a mental harm
My sole chief belief is that Islam
My beats pumped
So let it grab ya
I got a trick but my name ain't Ali-Baba
So open Sesame
Neva' heard the best of me
Betcha all the people intheplaceiswacknowlet'ssee
It's a New Beginning, my name Kwame
And if you didn't know I could tell you that I'm a
Mellow cool brotha
Slicker than oil
Rap get so hot it makes the spit boil
The Rhythm

Not the average rapper
The K is more
Rhymes like the thunderbolts of the mighty Thor
Be goin' wit' yourself
Cuz I can conquer boy
I break MCs
Like a Tonka toy
Smooth, suave, savoir faire, debonair
Come in the party yeah I see you stop and stare
To hear the man to only have yo hand shook
You dress GQ to me you got The Jordache Look
Cuz I'm the mystical
Rap is polyphystical
Ask about Kwame
Hey say he is a cool fella
He's always mellow
He's neva high-stung spark
When the mic is near him
It cleva I run smooth like Moet
Recite just like a poet
Ain't my slam oh yeah I know it
Cuz when I'm on the mic while boys say oh golly
Slick on my tip like the hip on Polygrip
I go cameo be on the Grammy show
I be sleek as a sheik I'll freak any ho
In the panty hose pumping clothes
Yo my rhymes slam well I suppose cuz
I'm might meander Hmm... throw a shenanigan
To write a fresh rhyme you know I can again
Cuz I destroy bust 'em like a hemorrhoid
Strong like a steroid avoid the Noid
The Rhythm

The black can take a rap the M A X
And as I step in the party that's when they ask
For me to get on strong no fear like a gladiator
Turn on steam up MCs like a radiator
Play 'em all out executioner style
Speak my peace just release refusing to smile
This is serious though I rap a little humor
But still MCs I hear assume I could neva
Bust a fat rap twice
And at that price
On any mic you gave me I got nice
I push a pull up a sit up get up I'm fed up
Shut ya lip up and let's go head up
Poisonous as venom no mistakes in 'em
Gucci on silk you got Vasco in denim
No my name ain't Taco, Emilio or Paco
But Kwame boy and I got yo
Chick on the side cuz she sweatin' my tip
Gave a peck on the neck just to wetten my lip
I don't drop my pants for no Raggedy Anns
Just to pass up a chance on a kids romance
I should have blown this mic
Like I said I might
Got the force of 20 men like a Jedi knight
And
It's kinda hard for me not to do it slow
So
I gotta go

*sound of clocks ringing*

[Verse One: MC Serch]
Ready in the intro, cue up the Serch-lite
Point us to the center stage (I'll grab the first mic)
Projectin the voice with this mic that I'm cuffin
You ain't my nucka, SUCKER I'm snuffin
The word of the 3rd stands true, so no panickin
(Man verse man) you freeze up like a mannequin
Petrol, you let go, the wax for the new jacks
To dwell upon you're steppin on the trigger as the tune smacks
(Square in the butt) Pete gave me the cue
So I'mma put up or shut up until my jam is through
But for now I wanna freak em, so I'll embark
To spark your mission posse, til way past dark
(Don't park there's no standin) or I'll play the five-oh
You don't stop movin until the Serch says so
To keep the tribe open, shootin out to play em
Three the hard way'll keep you steppin' to the A.M

[Beastie Boys samples playing]
(At the sound of the tone, the time will be 1 A.M.)

[Verse Two: Pete Nice]
My mind has a question, I respond
To a silver domed microphone (one step beyond)
Straight to eighty-eight to the curves of the 90's
I'm universal, I set a line free
Behind me, the three the hard way, the jackpot
(Awaitin Satan's, tryin to take cheap shots)
We groove crowds, the three stand proud
The brothers round the way sit down and say
(How'd you do this?) Ludicrous rhythm of rhyme
Anticipate like a bottle of Heinz.. KETCHUP
(No catch up!) Cause you fell behind
I'm steppin to the A.M. -- dickin down swine
Pete Nice skims over lyrics, I pick em
Strong and long, you're wrong, I stick em
(He's the law with the sword) with my cable swingin
(Like _The Pit or the Pendulum_) Pete Nice bringin
The sunrise with no lies, legitimate (and you despise)
Envy this MC's magnitude (so realize)
The MC emceed (The DJ deejayed em)
Until the next time I keep you steppin' to the A.M

[Sample]

[Verse Three: MC Serch]
No weight on the felt plate, deep bass below rise
Needle torture groove, move the record til the wack stride
(Schoolin the swine on the strength of my vocab)
Bet you wonder you're a goner
(You're thinkin that you had)
Lyrics to the A.M. but the house needs a swinger
You st-st-st-st-stutter, but I'm a stinger
(My rhymes so potent, I wrote em and it's evident)
You're just a stunt, seekin a settlement
The lyrical line (The artical original)
Afflict like a convict, I ain't no criminal
Scheamin on a cable or slobbin the knob
You played me like a foul ball
(How you livin Hobbes?!?!!)
Now groove into the A.M., the master spoon feedin
Out a jumper, you're bumpin a freak while I'm G'n
Peter let the record spin (Serch'll get a second wind)
MOTIVATE THE CROWD, til it's steppin' to the A.M

[Sample]

[Verse Four: Pete Nice]
I slide swiftly, keep a brother steppin
(loungin, strength in my throat)
Sweatin as you get hit with the rhythm
My lines sustain like a crane, so uplift them
(slow and smooth) Flowin like fluid
The mass did worship the lyrics the three did
(amid all crisis) Drop it like a guillotine
(You're moist) fearing the voice of the rhyme fiend
Scene is zipped, Pete Nice is your worst dream
Fulfilled your illed I thrilled (I heard a LOUD scream)
My mind is cued, so I run down a menu
That downgrades the weak as my lyrics tend to
(the needs of a shaker, sweatin to the point of exhaust)
So listen to the mission horse
Blinded by the science, my mind starts flexin
Sexin down females to the A.M., perplexin
A complex reflex (you wonder if we slumber)
The three don't sleep (Aiyyo Pete Nice take em under!)
Steppin to the A.M., I'm steppin to the mic
To snatch up and smash up the club until daylight!

They be doin dope... NOOOOOOO
They be gangbangin!  NOOOOOOO
All them brothers need to just
Pause

Yeah I'm with that
Here comes the Afros, and the forty ounce crew
Who say slowly but surely, we gonna turn the mother out
We got more, in store, young ladies on the floor, so cool out
Pause

Intro, which means I start it
In other words, herbs departed
Pause, stop for the cause
Get up, get down, you get yours
Chill, no time to get ill
Word to herb -- yeah it's the will of God
So whassup Hobbes?
Just jock, clock, rock, and don't stop but

Pause, pause for the cause, get yours
But don't break laws
Quit, quit it, forget it
Pause, say your way with it
Pause, if you did it, admit it
Cause, you shouldn'ta did it
Next time, you think of doin a crime
Pause, and remember this rhyme

Pause for the cause, cause broken laws
Are just like broken jaws
They take a long time to heal
I'm for real, and I know the deal
Look it over, investigate
Evaluate, think!
Life is wrong, and full of flaws
Before you break laws just pause!

I think that worked man (4X)

Pause
Yeah pause, this beat is dope D
I'm tellin you, this beat is dope, just slammin, it's dope

Well if it's dope, I hope it's not crack
Or coke, or nuttin like somethin you EVER smoke
And if they offer you some say NO
Or pause
The reason I wrote this rhyme, is not to climb
But just to tell all mankind
That the use and abuse of drugs -- will what?
Will, blow, your, mind

Like dough makes bread, it goes straight to your head
You're misled and then you're dead
Now that's not fly, when you die
On a high
Like a trip, oooh, you make me sick
Ill, lookin like doo doo on a stick
You don't have to be a vic
Life is like a flick, so pause

Pause, p-pause, pause, p-p-pause

Alright y'all, now that you understand
My man Run never ran
I'm gonna take this mic yo my hand
And hand this to the one man band

Now pause, now pause

I'm Jay, I make up the trey
Now check out the dance that I display
It's called the pause
A new thing, on the dancefloor
First you move, then you stop
Combine the hustle, foxtrot, pop and lock
Put em all together why because
It's called the pause

Slammin, the dance is slammin
Pause, the people are jammin
Stop again, back to the groove
I show you how to move
Pause
It's simple, just like stop and go
You can pause on the fast or slow
Participate, won't you all get down
Here's a solo from my homeboy Stanley Brown

Ahh yeah, I like this R&B shit...
Pause, pause, one more time!
Yeah, do that, do that...
Now pause!

People of the world
There's a serious problem
And it's called crack
I'm telling you
Stay away from it
It makes you do crazy things

[ VERSE 1 ]
Disruption, disorder will nourish, not justify
Those that live at the F.B.I
Look at mama's baby comin home high
As she runs with tears in her eyes
Crack will snatch your sister, your father, your mother
Your brother, whole lotta others
Situation number one, that son of a gun
Look what the brother has done
He destroyed his credibility and the trust in me
And he used to be down with the D
His mind is hungry for a piece of the rock
So he walks up and down the block
Fiendin, schemin, no more is he dreamin
His life is controlled by the force of beamin
Scotty, he's gettin deeper in the sauce
In other words, the brother is lost

[ Chorus ]
	(At the F.B.I.)
	(Free Base Institute)
	That's where they go to get high   (3x)

[ VERSE 2 ]
She's outta control on the a.m. stroll
24-7 her body is sold
She used to be the neighborhood fly girl
But now the base pipe has entered her world
I saw her one night in an alley slobbin the knob
To her it's a full-time job
The sucker with her was lookin for cheap sex
For 50 cents she said I could be next
So I snatched the bitch by her nappy weave
And I said, ""Girlfriend, please
You better check into a rehabilitation
Cause you're a fuckin crack patient""
The bitch dissed me, swung and missed me
Then she asked, could she kiss me
It was the crack on full attack
That had this beautiful sister trapped

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 3 ]
I'm makin a point
While you smoke your joint
While you point at each other
Let my point reach you
Crack is not only a ghetto drug
It's a drug in the high class too
Don't be fooled by the rich and famous
Cause see, they will try to blame this
On the people from the street, so they could keep
Out of the media, but they can't sweep it
Under the rug, they caught the drug bug
And their own grave has been dug
Then you read about it, a star in rehab
Now it's time for me to take a stab
At the sport figures, your idol, your hero
After the game: ""Yo, yo, let's get a kilo""
AWOL from practice, didn't show for the game
Because of the pipe and flame
Substance abuse has made another star go under
With the force of thunder

[ Chorus ]

[ VERSE 4 ]
Little Johnny and Tommy saw their mommy
Hittin the pipe with her best friend Conny
She looked like she suffered from malnutrition
The kids are hungry, no food in the kitchen
Their gear's been worn for a month and a half
That was the last time they had a bath
Cause the crack has the man command
The welfare check to the dopeman

[ Chorus ]

(Don't) (Don't) (Don't) (Don't do it)
(Do it) (do it) (do it)
Baby) (baby) (baby)

[ VERSE 5 ]
I see baseheads in a state of their own
In the zone where the baseheads roam
And on the same block are the ones who sell to them
So I walked up to money makin Slim
And said, ""Do you consider you're helpin get rid of
Our brothers and sisters?"" He did admit a
Touch of guilt, but I saw it in his eyes
That the brother was tellin me lies
He said, ""A man has to do what a man has to do""
As he guzzled the Ol' E brew
His point of view was, if he wasn't drug dealin
He would be out there stealin or killin
In a world of confusion it's no illusion
Game of life, people are losin
Boozin, cocaine crack abusin
On the devil's side you are choosin

[Queen Latifah]
The ladies will kick it, the rhyme that is wicked
Those that don't know how to be pros get evicted
A woman can bear you, break you, take you
Now it's time to rhyme, can you relate to
A sister dope enough to make you holler and scream

[Monie Love]
Ayo, let me take it from here, Queen...
Excuse me but I think I'm about do
To get into precisely what I am about to do
I'm conversating to the folks that have no whatsoever clue
So listen very carefully as I break it down for you
Merrily merrily merrily merrily hyper happy overjoyed
Pleased with all the beats and rhymes my sisters have employed
Slick and smooth throwing down the sound totally a yes
Let me state the position: Ladies first, yes? (Yes)

(Yeah, there's going to be some changes in here)

[Monie Love]
Believe me when I say being a woman is great, you see
I know all the fellas out there will agree with me
Not for being one but for being with one
Because when it's time for loving it's the woman that gets some
Strong, stepping, strutting, moving on
Rhyming, cutting, and not forgetting
We are the ones that give birth
To the new generation of prophets because it's Ladies First

[Queen Latifah]
I break into a lyrical freestyle
Grab the mic, look into the crowd and see smiles
Cause they see a woman standing up on her own two
Sloppy slouching is something I won't do
Some think that we can't flow (can't flow)
Stereotypes, they got to go (got to go)
I'm a mess around and flip the scene into reverse
(With what?) With a little touch of ""Ladies First""

Who said the ladies couldn't make it, you must be blind
If you don't believe, well here, listen to this rhyme
Ladies first, there's no time to rehearse
I'm divine and my mind expands throughout the universe
A female rapper with the message to send the
Queen Latifah is a perfect specimen

[Monie Love]
My sister, can I get some?

[Queen Latifah]
Sure, Monie Love, grab the mic and get dumb

[Monie Lovie]
Yo, praise me not for simply being what I am
Born in L-O-N-D-O-N and sound American
You dig exactly where I'm coming from
You want righteous rhyming, I'mma give you some
To enable you to aid yourself and get paid
And the material that has no meaning I wish to slay
Pay me every bit of your attention
Like mother, like daughter, I would also like to mention
I wish for you to bring me to, bring me to the rhythm
Of which is now systematically given
Desperately stressing I'm the daughter of a sister
Who's the mother of a brother who's the brother of another
Plus one more; all four
Have a job to do, we doing it
Respect due, to the mother who's the root of it
And next up is me, the M-O-N-I-E L-O-V-E
And I'm first cause I'm a L-A-D-I-E

[Queen Latifah]
Contact and in fact, the style, it gets harder
Cooling on the scene with my European partner
Laying down track after track, waiting for the climax
When I get there, that's when I tax
The next man, or the next woman
It doesn't make a difference, keep the competition coming
And I'll recite the chapter in verse
The title of this recital is ""Ladies First""

Step out into the night
Queens of civilization are on the mic
The scene is right, the crowd is hype
I expel the wack and those who bite
Why, cause I'm that type
Swaying with beats 45 King style
He wants me to sing but I swing, so meanwhile
A footnote for the opposite sex
Monie ripped the mic, I rocked it next
Plex, you never catch me at my worst
You get the drift? It's Ladies First

Intro: (sound of woman being fucked)

Verse 1
[BM] When the party's over, we can get together
Go to my house and fuck forever
And do whatever comes to mind
Let me stick my dick in your behind
You can pour me a glass of Dom Perignon
Then suck my dick until I cum
Soft is your body, tender is your kiss
C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI] No need to act stuck-up, pretty and seditty
Got a funky disposition and you think you're witty
You're not used to people saying things like this
It's called criticism, and not a diss
I only give compliments when they are due
Now I'm gonna tell you all the truth
You claim to be a virgin, I mean the purest
I'll be gentle, baby, cause we can do this!

Verse 2
[BM] Love is the key to end all your woes
You'll be my bitch, not a dirty ho
Together as one we will be
I'll be fucking you and you'll be sucking me
Then lick my ass up and down
Lick it 'till your tongue turns doo-doo brown
Don't try to be slick and give me a kiss
C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI] Bitch, it's time to spend the night
Let's walk the beach in the moonlight
Holding each other like lovers do
When the pussy's wet, I'll know what to do
Makin' love, holdin' you near
Screams and moans is all I hear
Quick is your tongue, soft is your lips
Suck it, bitch, cause you can do this!

Verse 3
[BM] Let's get it goin' on, let's act a fool
Listen and learn while I take you to school
You say you don't fuck on the first date?
Then fuck you, bitch! I ain't gonna wait
Cause my dick is hard and my back is strong
I'll find another bitch to get it on
Cause now is the time so stop the bullshit
C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI] As you move your body, the shit you say
Will make any man want to stay
Cause being with you is all I ask
And fucking you will be my task
My lonely nights will be filled with fun
No more clubs and sex on the run
Just suck this dick, while here I lay
You can do this, so c'mon, babe!

(Mixx cuts ""Fuck me, bitch!"")

Verse 4
[BM] Bitch, you say you's gonna give me some
Now you wanna start acting dumb
You wanna play cat and mouse
When I catch you, I'mma stick my dick in your mouth
Now stop the teasin' and start the pleasin'
Just fuck me good until I skeet
Bitch, stop fakin', you need to quit it
C'mon, baby, cause we can do this!
[FKI] Step to me and fall to your knees
Suck this dick, put me at ease
Do something special you know I like
Smokin' head and please don't bite
Slow and easy I pull the seat back
Up and down, as I climax
Steady in motion, I quietly say
We can do this, so suck it, babe!

Woman's voice:
""I think that type of sexual activity is disgusting!""

This jam is amplified, so just glide (glide)
And let your backbone slide

You listen to every word I say
Every verb you heard I play snaps a vertabrae
You try to cover, a hover me, a roast, a fake
A flag, then I run a post
Toast, I'm the most
D-E-F's how it goes
No X's or O's or tic-tac-toes
LTD knows, this ain't a game, I'm on a mission
Call me a hip-hop, tip-tac-tition
I rap just like a slab of clay that's shapeless
Jeff ain't no shimmer, no glass is tasteless
A universe without light is lifeless
That's why I always take time to write this
I mold it in my hands before I start chiselin
Could be a rain, or brainstorm, or drizzlin
Sun could be shining, sun could be showerin
Practice make perfect, and I'm powerin, flowerin
My lyrics are awesome
Tunin' from human, bloomin' a blossom
Blowing away blockades and barracades
Make ya black and blue from the blast and the blaze
It's a bloodsport, bloods builds up back
I make your vision go blurry
While your brain goes black into oblivion
Beats from box to box to bates
Rocks from blocks and blocks
Let your backbone slide

[Maestro Fresh Wes]
Just let it slide y'all, I don't give a (DAMN! damn)
If ya backbone quiver
Man oh man, watch ya swiver
Wind some twine your spine while your slither
It's contagious, an epidemic
You try to lift, you're cool, but it fell again
Rap scholar, soul like a Dominican
But like I said before, I'm not American
It's who you are, not the way you went
We all originate from the same descent
I make alot of cents, sense, and pence
Gold (gold), myrrh and frakincense
When I'm in France they blow me francs
Frank, with your swiss account is the way I bank-pank
At home, I make bills are brown from my sound
In the states green like the grass in the ground
When I'm in England, they pass me pounds now
I clock cash in every town, so I slide (slide)
But nowadays, I'm trapped
(why's that?)
So many suckers on my sacroiliac
It's like a rap-sack, backpack
(wic-wic-whack)
Give me some slack jack
Rap is like a jungle
Where rhyme for rhyme is like a vine to vine
Swung line to line of mine
I'm collossal, you'se a mosquito
I'mma play Tarzan, you play Cheetah
Cheeta, biter, love to forge
Better yet, I'll call you Curious George
Cause curiosty cold killed the cat
Can't hide so black to the side
Let your backbone slide

[Maestro Fresh Wes]
The keyword is synchronism
Yo, check out my homeboy dance to the rythmn
And hey, this hey, oh, this ain't Forte
I'm coming double-f
Fortissamo, F-F for funky fresh
My DJ is LTD, mellow-flex
You listen to the poetry, big jumbo jet
Vocabulary golden, beats from my rollin
Stone cold lyrics with the microphone I'm holdin
Words I rip, egos I strip
I make sucker crews kick, Dick Van Dyke flips
I get busy, they're dizzy, they start to collide
They should've stepped off (stepped off), I let it slide
But now they got brasen, dry like a raisin
I glaze like a vase, I smash you like days
Until they realize, they shouldn't have ripped
It's '89, not Beetoven's fifth or sixth
It's a throwdown, I'm conducting it
Because like a highrise, I'm constructing it
Was once thoughts, pen, and paper
Now it's a tower, a soul, a skyscraper
It's getting out of hand after I've created a monster
My musical monologue makes you wanna
Move with the Maestro
You feel hot so you set the blend, the cresendo is nice yo
I'm the guy, the rhythm is a ride (the rhythm is a ride)
To the fresh side, and let your backbone slide

This is a throwdown

You know what I said a
Gotta potty, I had to farty
Rappin' on the mic, uh-oh, there goes my body
I'm just a man with lots of class
And when I eat a lot of beans I have to pass gas
Ooh, there, it growled like a bear
I think it's time to check my dirty underwear
Tick tock a you don't stop
To the tick tick a you don't quit
I farted again, it sounded like thunder
Went to the bathroom they said take a number
From start to stall had to potty y'all
Refried beans gave my booty a call
37, yes, that's my number

(sung)Stranded, stranded on the toilet bowl
What do you do when you're stranded, no paper on the roll
To prove you're a man you must wipe with your hand
Then everyone will know you were stranded (cry)

You know what I did next? I grabbed the guy that was in the stall before me
And I looked him in the eye and I said:

(sung) It's all because of you
Got poopoo on my shoe
I must confess I used my shirt to clean up this mess
Oh don't you see
I got poop on my body
You took my paper away from me (cry)

Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

Will somebody tell me where the bathroom is?

There's a potty over there
There's a potty over here
There's a potty over there
A potty over there
There' s a potty everywhere

By a sucker MC that wants to be like me
No trait of originality
But yo, I am not one to down another
So like I said before, just go for yours, sucker
I'm gonna take the time to drop a dope line
Or maybe even two, for you and your crew
So you can start shakin and movin all around
To the Lyte Thee MC and the King Of Chill sound
It's new and improved like a freshly cut diamond
Perfect timin, like a gem it's shinin
Or better yet a ruby, somewhat like a saphire

Got the clean drawers on, yeah, I hope ya
Do, because I'm gonna strip you of your peace of mind
Now your piece is mine, damn, that's unkind
Come on, admit it, the Lyte is too fly
The rhymes that I say you can't deny
Because 100% is what I give it (Say what?)
I haunt the house with the hip-hop spirit
I tear it, repair it
Like a hand-me-down make you wear it
Save all your crocodile tears, grin and bear it
And with all your other brothers you're gonna share it
You hear me, junior? Cause soon you'll
Be a grown man with the mic in your hand
And understand biting's not part of the plan
That's wrong, I thought I taught you better than that
But that's what you get from a stabber in the back

WELCOME TO THE FUCK SHO-O-O-OP!

Verse 1: Fresh Kid Ice
There's only one place where we can go
Where the price is right just to fuck a ho
It's always popular with the girls and the guys
Cause for all my money, it's the best buy
Ten dollars, two hours is the time of the stay
It's more than enough time to slay
Each room has a bed and also a sink
So you can wash your dick after fucking the pink
But be careful of the things that you use
Cause you can get arrested for sex abuse
So as you hit the door and the panties drop
Whole lot of suckin' and fuckin' at the Fuck Shop!

Verse 2: Brother Marquis
Please come inside, make yourself at home
I want to fuck, cause my dick's on bone
You little whore behind closed doors
You would drink my cum and nothing more
Now spread your wings open for the flight
Let me fill you up with something milky and white
Cause I'm hopin' to slay you, rough and painful
You innocent bitch, don't be shameful
Bring out the ice cubes and the hot water
This is the second half, and not the second quarter
I'll fuck you 'till you sleep; you'll sleep like a baby
And in your dreams, you'll say I'm crazy
In the Fuck Shop!

YOU'RE IN THE FUCK SHOP, BABEEEE!

First let me explain that I'm a hustler
Now here's an example of what a hustler must do
In this lifetime you got two things
Bad and good, and ain't nothin in between
Now I'ma break down a little slogan
So you can figure out the path that I'm strollin
Some say it's hard, some say it's dirty
Some say it's all sex, money and murder
Now me myself, see, I'm a hustler
And I rather be that than a new jack buster
I'm always known for doin somethin
Cause I'm always in the mix when the shit start jumpin
At a club and at a house
If a sucker disrespect, I get upset
Now I'ma make my plan to get with it
I'ma hit, and seek, and destroy it
Now what could I really be sayin?
That all set aside, that I don't be playin
187's a killer, even iller
And I'm also a thriller
And of course I'm untouchable

See, I got to misbehave, just a little taste
Push up, increase, yo, I start the phase
New lyrics, breakin like a running rebel
For the words are defined, cause we're on a higher level
Cause I'm goin out with Jack in my system
Hustlers from the house, you can just list them
Lookin for some heartbeat, ready to rumble
If I spot a soft sucker his world's got to crumble
Pardon me a moment, I be just at it
Brothers claimin what ain't there, they're rhyme bandits
I will arraign my death until I reach my peak
And if the king slip, I've got to impeach

On the 12 spin, behind his back
2nd DJ jumpin off is Go Mack
On a mission to keep on dishin all fools

Lyrical techniques keep fools in a daze
Straight up your panjacks just to hear me faze
(Now what about the brother we took out?
Don't sweat him, cause he didn't have no clout
Cause yo, in attack I broke his back, I show no slack
And I never got caught because
I'm untouchable)

On the corner where the dope and destruction meets
Where a cool young brother could never be soft
On a top-dollar street where shit jumps off
You're never up on a, tagged as a tinted
You're tryin to get out, but you're already in it
Cause pooh-put suckers don't amaze me
Cause I live my life wild, ruthless and crazy
If I don't hit you, you probably hit me
How could it be, I'm the illustrator KM.G
And see, that's just one thing that never happens
KM.G, 187 - lose when we rappin
See, we slide out some suckers who be nappin
Grab the mic, put in the clip and commence to start cappin
Cause when we flow, we got dignity
And we're givin the world an opportunity
That there's a lesson to be taught when you come to our show
Cause we scratch on our table, and bust the rhyme flow
Plus our lyrics is steaks, and rhythms come clean
Do damage, break backs, if you know what I mean
We stay untouchable

Earlier today in Broward County, appellate court
Judges upheld the previous ruling to ban the sale of Miami rap group the 2 Live Crew's double-platinum album, ""Nasty As They Wanna Be,"" in Broward County

[Intro: Lawyer]
We think it's the banning of free speech. First Amendment protects material, presumptively

We don't talk about, uh, harassing and sexually brutalizing women in my music, man!
We don't do that in my music, man! I'm tired of you saying that!

Saying we're too nasty and we're 2 Live
Corrupted politicians playing games
Bringing us down to boost their fame
They must be joking thinking we will fall
But they're like flies movin' the wall
We stand tall from beginning to end
With the help from fans and all our friends
Freedom of speech will never die
For us to help, our ancestors died
Don't keep thinking that we will quit
We'll always stand and never sit
We're 2 Live, 2 black, 2 strong

I take a precaution that nobody else has
I stickered my album
I made two versions- two versions- two versions

The First Amendment gave us freedom of speech
So what you sayin'? It didn't include me?

[Verse 1]
Tic Tac Toe is a game I used to play
When I was little I used to say
I got the X and I got the O
It don't matter cause it's Tic-Tac--Toe

Now I'm a little bit older
I like to play just a little bit bolder
I like gettin' girls and givin' em pearls
And their legs across my shoulders

I love to go to the disco
See a fly girl and say hello
They just look me in the eye and pass right by
With that booty shakin' like Jello

I like to speak cause that's bein' nice
It makes me mad when I have to speak twice
But that's the game that girls like to play
It's just Tic-Tac-Toe and roll the other way

[Chorus]
X, and O. As in yes, and no
X, and O. As in sex, maybe so

X is for yes and O is for no
X is for sex or maybe so
You might get some if you play this game
All girls love it but smooth is their game

[Verse 2]
That's why they just walk right by
Laughin', gigglin', shakin' that pie
Girls are what you what when you come up to them
So don't play dumb and try to school em

That's when you got to be real cool
Jump in the biz and act a fool
Pull out the portable car phone
Next thing you know you'll be drivin' em home

On the way there you're thinkin' bout one thing
Girls ain't dumb they know you want the wild thing
You through the X and go for the kiss
They throw the O and go for the dis

[Chorus]

[Refrain]
Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?
Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?
Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?
Do you wanna play Tic-Tac-Toe?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I met this girl by the name of Judy
Kind of cute with a real nice booty
Hard to get and likes to play tough
Cause she knows I want the funky stuff
When I spoke, she wouldn't even speak
Til she saw me in the biz that week
Took her to the movies and bought her a treat
Went to my house and made the bed squeak

Yeah that Judy puts up a fight
But I won with the X cause I rolled that night
Just when things started to feel good
We rolled a little fast and we broke the wood
My dad got up cause he heard some knockin'
Thought it was a crook me and Judy was rockin'
Came to my room opened up the door
Son whatcha doin'?
Playin Tic-Tac-Toe

To see so many Nubian faces
So many original faces here tonight)

[Jaz] Hey yo, what's up, Jay Zee?
[Jay] Yo, what's up, Jaz?
[Jaz] Ain't nothin
Just chillin, you know
A lotta fronters out there perpetratin
Tryin to rock a old trippin style
Youknowmsayin?
[Jay] We have none of that, alright?
Originators is here
[Jaz] Word up
Let me kick a little somethin
[Jay] Word up
[Jaz] Guess you'll tune in later, right?
[Jay] Yeah, but won't you
Kick, kick, kick it

[VERSE 1: The Jaz]
My rhymin and singin technique is applaudable
Livin in luxury, and it's affordable
No other brother is better than me, the J, the a, the z
The cream of the crop, and the top of the top
The suckers are tryin to stop
The biggeda-, the biggeda-, the boss of the hip-hop
Hop, they'll never come near
They'll never come here, no, not this year
They're growin in fear, I'm very sincere, I will jerk tears
Operator pushin the data, I'm talkin bout info
And check it, you're still stumblin and bumblin off the intro
So take it a step at a time, this dope rhyme
Be makin a note that it's refined by a skilled mind
This is a warning for biters
Stealers and robbers and sucker reciters
Call it a night, and before you roam
Don't try this at home
The style that I'm usin, I'm here to abuse
The garbage and junk I refuse
Divy it up, cause I'm here to collect my dues from all of yous
This ain't no cartoon drama caper, pass the paper
Your mind's in a daze, higher than a skyscraper
I'm teachin and reachin and preachin
And showin and flowin and growin and blowin
The rest of the best right out of the box
I shoot the funky sweat socks
I obliterate and I devastate
You wanna go head to head
Rhymin until you fall dead?
Great, make it a date
Never a conflict or a debate, you're callin me sir, see
You sucker, you fucker, you pussy, you wussy, nobody can verse me
The Jaz is pushin the power
You two-bucks-an-hour
Unable, mentally unstable, to me you cower
You never can write a dope lyric to have an effect just like this did
To be at the peak in the field of hip-hop, you only wish, kid
And Jiggeda-Jay Zee, yo, yo, my partner
G-g-g-get on the mic, and cold start to

[VERSE 2: Jay Zee]
Wreckin and wreckin in seconds less than speeds of light
So the miggeda-more that come, the miggeda-merrier, right, right
Excitin the mic much to the delight of millions of Nubians
And Amorites just can't understand the groove we're in
Cool, it might take a couple of takes for you to clarify
Don't lie, you coulda never got in on the first try
But never to worry, I'm not in a hurry, take your time
Cause it's my rhyme, I siggeda-said so, and I'm J-a-y-Z, y'all know me
I wish you co-write, cause you'd pay me all the rhymes you stole from me
Leave you freeze in a minute, you gotta get in it breathin
Only when it lets, no sweat, I stutter-step with ease, and
Stop fakin, you're makin it, son
I'm breakin and breakin and breakin your tongue
Don't get caught perpetratin the cool ones
Figure we're bigger and badder and better, and baby, let's face it
We bring havoc, flowin faster than rabbits, try to race it
The lyrical miracle writer, flippin until it drives you
Crazy, seek spiritual help from Jaz and Jay Zee
Standin in awe, you saw the best of em all, the rest will fall
Requestin for more, jaws stuck on the floor
These lyrics I pour, we saw, because we're greater
And we are the thiggida-thiggida-thiggida-the (the) originators

[Verse 1]
This is a warning, another cut to move on
Another beat that's so strong
Hold on and I get wicked and then some
Stir up shit as the wit gets wisdom
P-Dog comin' up, I'm straight loc
Pro-black and it ain't no joke
Comin' straight from the mob that broke shit last time
Now I'm back with a brand new sick rhyme
So black check time and tempo
Revolution ain't never been simple
Follow in the path of  Fanon and Mao just
Build your brain and we'll soon make progress
Paid your dues, don't snooze or lose
They came with the masterplan that got you
So know who's opposed to the dominant dark skin
Food for thought as a law for the brother man

[Verse 2]
P-Dog with a gift from heaven
Tempo 116.7
Keeps you locked in time with the program
When I get wild I pile on dope jams
Then spit on your flag and government
Cause help the black was a concept never meant
Nigga please, foodstamps and free cheese
Can't be the cure for a sick disease
Just the way the devil had planned it
Rape then pillage everyone on the planet
Then give 'em fake gods at odds with Allah
Love thy enemy and all that hoopla
Hear close to the words I wrote
Crack, cocaine are genocide on black folk
Who in their right mind ever coulda missed this?
Damn right when you think seditious
And I move swiftly, you can't get with me
The triple six moved quick but missed me
When I came off involved in conscience
So don't ask why next time I start this

[Verse 3]
Now let's get wild, allow me to freestyle
I build and fill your mind up with know-how
A common sense, a defense the next time
A pig tried to step to this, listen
Never let someone whoop on ya
They don't belong to the set you from
Ya can't be intrigued by the leads a pig lead
Unless you don't give a fuck to be free
Keep stompin' on, I keep stompin'
Attitude but I ain't from Compton
I can't be fucked around or muffed around
I can't be held down, check the sound
And keep in tuned on point on target
The revolution won't be thwarted
A setback cause my man it's plain to see
Must end all white surpremacy
So let the rhythm roll on when I kick this
Brothers gonna work it out with a quickness
And now you know just why a panther went crazy
The devil made me

Beware the beast man, for he is the
Devil's pawn. He kills for sport, or lust or greed
Yea, he will murder his brother to possess
His brother's land. Shun him, for he is the
Harbinger of death

Peace to the Gods
Peace Allah
A-yo there go that brother Grand Puba
I heard that brother got knowledge of self
Yo true indeed brother
Yo let's have that brother come over and add on to the cipher

[Grand Puba]
A-yo knowledge this
The attribute Hagi helper to another God
In need He Allah God Islam
As I proceed to civilize the uncivilized
Word of wisdom to the groove from the wise (speak on it God)
I guess I'm like the Verbalizer for the fact I'm moving blackwards
This asiatic black man is a dog spelled backwards
The maker, the owner, the cream of the planet Earth
Father of civilization, God of the universe
Manifesting thoughts with my infinite styles
Making sure this travels, twenty-three million miles
The other six I set the crucifix
Because the heart of the problem is this.. (speak on it God)
Preacher got my Old Earth putting money in the pan
For the rest of the week now I'm eating out a soup can
He has a home, drives a Caddy through town
Has my Old Earth believing that he's coming from the ground (Jesus)
Slain are those who fought for what was right
Slayed are those who fell victim to the pipe
A drug controlled substance, contained in a vial
Set up by the devil as he looks and he smiles
Good at the game of tricknology
But I have knowledge of myself you're not fooling me
You see the answer to me is black unity
Unification, to help our bad situation
I wrote this on a day of wisdom power
All being born to myself (God!)
I won't diss the next brother to be paid that's not my trade
It's just the plan that is designed by the colored man
Now our babies are born to think this is the way of us (the way of us)
That's the way the devil wants it so it is no fuss (it is no fuss)
It's just that sad old song self-destruction
To stop our reproduction

They put our Wisdom before us (murderer!)
That makes it Wisdom Knowledge (murderer!)
But we need Knowledge Wisdom
To bring forth the Understanding (murderer!)
Culture Freedom (murderer!)
Power Refinement (murderer!)
Equality God Build Destroy Borns our Cipher (mudererer!)

(Can a devil fool a Muslim?)
No, not nowadays bro
(Do you mean to say the devil fooled us 400 years ago?)
Why Equal Self, a trader made an interpretation
Saying that we'd receive more gold for our labor in his nation
(Did we receive more gold?)
God, Now Cipher
It's time to drop the bomb and make the devil pay the piper

(True indeed God true indeed God) Why Equal Self
(True indeed God true indeed..)

The solution, knowledge of self to better ourself
Cause I know myself, that we can live much better than this
Nothing's changed, it's just another sequel
The devil's still causing trouble amongst the righteous people
Drugs in our community (That ain't right)
Can't even get a job (That ain't right)
Poisoning our babies (That ain't right)
Lying who is God (That ain't right)
Well here's some food for thought, many fought for the sport
And the black man still comes up short?
It's time to motiviate, build and elevate
Blind deaf and dumb we've gotta change their mindstate
So I dip dip diver, civilize a 85er
Gotta let him know the devil's a conniver
This is the plan from the brotherman
From the motherland now it's time to take a stand
I keep striving to do my duty to awake 'em
To the universal family I say asalaam alaikum

Yeah..
Now I'mma do like this
Nuff respects to the brother Jazzy Jay, nuff respect
Nuff respects, to my Brand Nubian brothers
Bust it
Lord Jamar, God Allah
Derek X is on the flex
Alamo is good to go
Sincere, the God is in here
So move on black man, move on
We gotta move on black man, move on
Move on black man, move on
We gotta move on black man, move on
Now before I motivate I'mma just say like this
Please.. educate Allah's children, with equality

Move on black man, move on
You gotta move on black man, move on

I'll try to listen good and give the best advice that I can give
So, what's up with you this time?
Your honey took a dive and now he's playin with your mind?
Oh no, this can not be accepted
The feelings that belong to you must be protected
Hold up, time out, I shout, get it together sister
Tell him to be nice or ditch the mister

It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!

Get back on your feet please
I'm beggin you to check out all your own needs
Don't let nobody see you in a state of grievin, over the brother
There's another possibility
Which is for you to work out where you went wrong
I guarantee to you that it will not take long
For you to make your mind up if the two of you belong
You know where honey's head at, and where he's comin from
Get it out your system, don't be another victim
This took the nerve, oh boy, he really picked em, whaddya know
It's time for you to show you're not sleepin
A progress report on the two of you, you're keepin
Peekin through the peephole, to see if honey's sneakin
You estimated right, that night the other weekend
Collectively the facts should conclude the decision
You caught the brother in a terrible disposition

It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!

That's it, pack it up, be wise my sister
Cause the facts keep stackin up, tell him, to kiss the you know what
Make sure the door is shut, behind you
I do believe the brother's out of luck, and stuck
But that's not, your P-R-O-B-L-E-M
You gotta let him go and let him know this is the end
You've been kissed, dissed, listed as a dumb one
I hope he likes sad songs, he's gonna hum one
He's been a dum dum and that's the way it is forever
There comes a time, when you're at the end of your tether
And you know, I think you went FAR beyond that
So it was bound to backtrack
And smack you with an irksome vengeance as it attacks you
Makin sure you get the full entire view
Of who's to blame, at the end, of the game
Things will never be the same
And it's a cryin shame

[Verse 1]
Well I stumbled on a picture kinda made me laugh
A photograph, what brought me right back to the past
When I was a youngster
Quite nerd type, that wanted to be amongst the
Older, bolder, colder crowd
With fat gold chains and strolled around
In tucked silk suits, hundred dollar Bally boots
Hat to a tilt and a felt substitute
Fashions my have seemed to have worked
But it seems I was a fake, and fakes look like jerks
All I could do is scheme
Hoping that one day I'll be on the top of the team
No matter how hard I tried, I'd just collide
With being a fool and an old guy
It didn't work, and that annoyed
And I asked myself why can't I be oneovdabigboiz

Now I remember one day in the 7th grade
A new girl came to school and I must say
I slid, skid, crashed and got a crush
On her and all other things seemed like a bluff
I wouldn't dare to speak, didn't say a word
Trying to be a big boy, I just became a nerd
Doubting myself, thinking I'm all sissy and all
Either I was too short, too shy, or too small
Which was a sign of ignorance
So I brought up confidence
The next day I'm panicking
Stiff as a mannequin
What do you know
She doesn't even show
But there's tomorrow, the next day she came
Arm and arm with some dude, with some gangster name
Hopes and dreams in a flash were destroyed
All because of the fuss of oneovdabigboiz

I'm the one that told you not to worry
You'll grow up to be someone special
Take your time and don't you hurry
Cause soon you will be

They all had rides, I only had two feet
They used to pick their girls up but on a train we meet
Why can't I be a big boy I used to ask myself
And self said ""Why do you wanna be someone else
Why do you wanna wear what someone else wears
Or get a cut, like someone else's hair
Or be seen in someone else's glare
You know what I'm saying (you're right)"" YEAH!
I'll do my own thing speak my own slang
Be in my own swing, know what I'm saying
Cause baby I'm a star
You know who the hell I are
It's paying off a lot
I had everyone rocking the streets and wanting the polka dots
It's OK, this life is I enjoy
And it's cool being Kwame, not oneovdabigboiz

News Reporter:
Well, it seems they're in the news again.  The 2 Live Crew has
Started a dance craze that has basically taken the nation by
Storm!  Here's a report

Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
There's a brand new dance and it's comin' to your town
It's done by the people who can really throw down
You don't need to be a queen or a jack of spades
It's done by the brothers with the hi-top fades
It doesn't matter if you're shy or wild
It's done by all, man or child
Keep shakin' your head, like a goose
And work your body 'till it gets loose
Ladies, bend your back and also your knees
Shake your titties and let me squeeze
Then make a face like you wanna fart
Keep workin' them arms while doin' the Bart!

Verse 2
[Marquis]  Jitterbugs keep pumpin'!  Why you frontin'?
On the Bart, I'll keep the house jumpin'
Everybody follow me, do that dance, the B-A-R-T
Just step to the right and left
Do the Bart 'till you're out of breath
[Kid Ice]  It's brand new, the dance to do
The move for the 90's and it's comin' through
Girls, shake your titties and fall to your knees
Show that ass so I can squeeze
Then make the face like you wanna fart
Work them arms while doin' the Bart!

Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
It's the Bart, y'all, the brand new dance
Fellas, grab your dick; girls, shake that ass
To do this dance you must wear Nike's
Girl, you need bikinis, and no sexy nighties
To do this dance, you can't act cute
Fellas, get upon that ass like you're knockin' the boots
In!  Out!  Up and down!
When you're doin' the Bart, you're really gettin' down!
When you're doin' the Bart, you're gonna get wet
Right Guard can't save you, 'cause you're bound to sweat
Fat girls, we ain't forgot about you
The Bart's the dance that you can even do
First you need a tight fade, a couple black medallions
Some skiddo pants and then start dancin'
Unlike the Hammer, unlike the Humpty
When you're doin' the Bart, you've gotta get funky!

[Kid Ice]  It's the dance of the 90s, motherfuckers act wild
Your Granny can do it, so you should try
It's not just a dance; it's a state of mind
The fellas need to hi-jump the girls' big behinds
Keep shakin' your head, like a goose
And work your body 'till it get loose
[Marquis]  Jump up and down, but don't freak or hustle
When you're doin' the Bart, you use every muscle
Don't hurt yourself or exert yourself
You can do the Bart all by yourself
So why you sittin' there in your seat?
Just get on the floor and Bart to the beat!

[Intro: Parrish Smith]
Yeah LL Cool J in the house (slow down baby) knahmsayin?
EPMD in effect (slow down baby)
Snappin necks, cashin large checks (slow down baby)
All the non-believers can cold get the dick (slow down baby)
Y'knahmsayin? (slow down baby)
Cause this is daddy mack, king of the bozack
All my friends knows that (slow down baby)
Mix the master down...
As I kick it like this (slow down baby)

[Verse 1: Parrish Smith]
Cause you can get rugged, tough, hard like P
Tried to play my man but you couldn't touch me
You faggot, no comp' rapper on a quest
To get your head flown boy, you must be loc' on sess
Cause many often wonder is M.D. paid
You're God damn right punk, stay outta my way
Cause I clock G's while you clock Z's
And I don't smoke crack - I smoke MC's
So pick up a pen, cop a squat, and take note
A rapper suffered from bleedin, sprains and slit throats
Cause my style, deadly psychopath schizophrenic
A rapper choke like a carburetor, freeze up and panic
Cause I clock pesos, don't sell llello
'Nother word for cocaine mi amigo
That's Spanish, terminology for friend
Now sit back and ride my bozack as I send
Bass funk, with beats that thump
For speakers and amps, cold lined up in my trunk
My system's crankin my headlights are blinkin
Brothers ridin my tip L, at the same time thinkin DAMN
How could a brother be so nice?
Cause I'm the capital, P-E twice, M-D-E twice
I choose to squeeze, some choose to fight
I like to write but then again some bite
And while you was bangin on tables;

I was bangin Snow White - P!

Slow down baby
Yeahhhh - slow down baby
Uhh yeah - slow down baby
Uhh - slow down baby

The Ripper, the master, the overlordian
Playing MC's like a old accordion
I get the inspiration from unnecessary station
Them sayin' I was vacationin'
You can't quote with your weaker throat
Tryin to sneak a peek at how I freak the notes
Major MC's become minor B-flats
So retire the mic, get your chains and your bats
Here's your chance to advance, get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Pure entertainment, tonight's your arraignment
You're guilty - face down on the pavement!
No holds barred, it's time to get scarred
You and your squad better praise the real God
The undertaker, droppin thunder on fakers
When it comes to lyrics I'm as freaky as Seka
So lay the mic down slow and careful
Cause mine is fully loaded and I got another handful
A clip to slip in and start rippin
Divin and dippin and givin punks a whippin (aww shit)
Just in case you wanna go a few rounds or so
I'm down so that you clowns'll know
Me gettin burnt or hurt won't be tolerated
I got rhymes up the huh - forget it I'm constipated - L!

[Erick Sermon]
When I come around homeboy, watch your nuggets
A master on the beatdown, my style's rugged
When I attack the microphone, close the zone
Rap sees danger, can't roam
Security's packed and wall to wall can't fall
A rap tank is full so I can't stall
My microphone is filled with premium

Any whack MC that flexes, I'm creamin him
Not with lotion, bust the motion
Flotation when I rock on the mic, I'm like coastin
I'm unique, fatigued at my peak you still seek
A style cause yours extra weak
New method, to rip the stage at my age
And get loose and kick, like Bruce in a rage
I'm on a rampage

[Intro: Ice Cube & Yo-Yo]
[Ice Cube]
Yo Jinx, man, we gotta find somebody that's down for hers, man
All these girls sympin', man!
Who you think fit the category?

[Yo-Yo]
It's me, the brand new intelligent black woman Y-O-Y-O. Which is Yo-Yo, but I'm not to be played like I was made by Mattel.
But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male
I rhyme about uprising, uplifting the woman
[?] superior to handle any male
Any time, any rhyme, any flow, and any show
And if you ask my producers, they'll reply “No…”

[Hook: Ice Cube]
“You can't play with my Yo-Yo!”
(Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out)

[Verse 1]
My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a ho, no
I like to flow so swift, it's got to be a gift
So yo, let the beat lift as I rip and rhyme
And rap and slap all the girls who can't adapt
To the fact I hit the 8-ball often
The earrings I wear are called Dolphins
Check the booty, yo, it's kind of soft and
If you touch it, you living in a coffin (word to mother)
I'm in the 90's, you're still in the 80's, right?
I rock the mic, they say I'm not lady-like!
But I'm a lady, who will pull a stunt though
I K-O suckas, and even hit the blunt
So what you wanna do? You must play hit and run
It through to me, you simply can't get none
You wetter than a hot whore in snow
Tell 'em, Ice Cube!

[Hook] (Ice Cube)
No, you can't play with my Yo-Yo, suckas
You can't play with my Yo-Yo
(What's your name baby?)

[Verse 2]
That's right, my name is Yo-Yo, but no, I'm not a Duncan
As I rap, Chilly Chill bring in the funk and
I'll steal yo man, that's if he is a hunk and
He'll call me Baby Yo, or even Pumpkin
I may be Buttercup, or even Miss Yo
We had dinner, and now we drinking Cisco
Hit the slow jams, it's getting cozy
You're home alone, so now you getting nosy
You're kind of young
So of course you had to call my place
Hang up in my face
It's a sad case of who your man's giving the dollars
What? Yep, I put lipstick on his collar
At home, he's gotta listen to ya holler
But he'll slap you, and sock ya, so why bother?!
But if you come knocking at my door (ay yo)
I'll smoke you, tell 'em, Ice!

[Hook] (Ice Cube)
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, sucka
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, yo, yo
Fool, 1990, stayin' sucka free, haha!
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo!
Yeah, tell em whats up

[Verse 3: Yo-Yo]
Yo, I hope you realize one day
That you're ""weak"" as Monday through Sunday
So listen to my Y-O, here's my bio
And next to me?
Ha! You're not fly, yo?!
You lack skills to be a woman that's black
Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts?!
Yo-Yo, is just trying to stop ya
Because the world ain't a big soap opera
It only takes one punch to drop ya
And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya
But no, I'm not living like that verse
Although I pack a real small Gat in my purse (right, right)
But no, it's not to cause corruptions
Just to fight back on destruction
Just thought you wanna know about the Y-O-Y-O
Yo, should I tell 'em, Ice?

[Hook] (Ice Cube)
They know what time it is
Fools, yeah!
You can't play with my Yo-Yo, yo yo
I'm out. I thought you knew!

Yo-Yo, the brand new intelligent black lady
Stompin' to the 90s!
For all y'all suckas
Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo

[Verse 4]
I'm similar to a metaphor, makes them want to yell on
But keep it at a limit to where they're yelling, ""More, more!""
I am very versatile, changing my ways to different styles
Knowledge is the key, experience is from my background
Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel inferior
Falling back on the hands of time makes no man superior
Should we dare to take the stand
And diss back all the men
Who know no more but [?] and thinks wit his ding-a-ling?
I think it's time that we defeat by standing on our on two feet
If we wanna live with justice and harmony
How many more rounds must I go in order to let my people know
Times were hard, things have changed (Don't try to play me out)

Here I am loungin' at a hype party
Then I see this lady with a hellafied body
With a pair of bedroom eyes that were clocking The Genius
Well, you see what I mean is
She had the look as if she was attracted
To me so what I did, I reacted
In a manner to show that I was feeling the same
Now check out the game
I said lovely, I be The Genius and how ya doing?
I'm on a chase and you're the one that I'm pursuing
She said it's the pleasure Genius, I'm doing kinda fine
But what's on your mind?
I said

CHORUS:
Girl
Come Do Me

I said sexy, where you live over yonda
What's your name?
She said it's Yolanda
She said she knew me from back in the days
And that I had her running on a wild sex craze
I said now you're kinda big and well-developed
And parts of your body just made my head swell up
She said her feelings were so deep for me
To the point where she wanted to sleep with me
I said c'mon babe, I know you're jokin'
She said if I'm jokin' you must be smokin'
I said the only think I wanna be smokin' is your boots
And she said ""I hear ya troop""
And just from that little bit of conversation
It put my hormones into activation
The whole thing just went to my head
As I held her hands and said
Baby, come do me

Hey good looking how many times may I say
That your gorgeous smile takes my breath away
Your soft warm little voice is very pleasing
And your tight mini-skirt is kind teasing
Me, it makes me wanna do the nasty
And you got the look of being very classy
So go ahead and whip it on me
As Latifah said,""gimme that body""
So you see right there I desire you
I'm not a pimp and I don't want to hire you
Cuase that's not what The Genius is about
Let my love slide in and never slip out

And yes y'all, the sounds that you hear is gonna be so real
You'll have no fear cause three live brothers are here
We got KRS-One from Boogie Down Productionsn, special shout to Melodie
We got my man Chuck D in the house from Public Enemy
And I am Kool Moe Dee
So are you ready?

[Verse 1: Kool Moe Dee ]
Are you ready, to elevate
As I rhyme on time you'll illuminate
Hard as diamond, knowledge shinin'
It's that time and it's all in the timin'
400 years, blood, sweat and tears
The rain is over, and the sun is here
Yeah, bright and clear, countdown to the year
No fear, cause I'm in there
Holding my mic like the staff of Ra
Bringing true light after dark
Brothers are live, but still unborn
It's almost morn and it's time to mourn
See the light like a crack of dawn
The comatose and the cracked are reborn
Regurgitating the garbage we're fed
Cause this time dawn is dawn of the dead

Ain't that funky? (Yeah, that's funky)

Ain't that funky? (Yeah, that's funky)
Ain't that funky? (Yeah, that's funky)
Get up

[Verse 2: Kool Moe Dee]
I rise and shine like the sun on the one
We dance together, we overcome
A wake-up call to wake up all
Stand up tall, get up and get up, y'all
Clap your hands in jubilation, meditation
Recreation, procreation of the mind
If you seek, we'll find
Born two times, but still one of a kind
Learn your past, find your path
The truth is infinite, like math
Countdown to the year two thousand
The thought alone is arousin'
When we sing I'll wake with the third eye
Rise with the sun and think with a bird's-eye
View, as I watch our exodus
When the higher conscience connects it's just

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kool Moe Dee]
The microphone is my funk receptor
When I speak on beat I'm trying to connect us
To what's left us messed up
Egos dressed up, got us effed up
You see onto instead of into
You see what you want to, instead of what you been through
You can take the rhyme I say
Read it, hear them, see them three ways
Combine the rhyme to any one of nine
For some still the light won't shine
You can take a shot in the dark, but keep missin'
You aim with one eye, you just don't listen
Cause see, in the dark you need all three
Your eyes are ears when you hear what you see
The five senses are all correlated
The sixth and seventh is how you elevate it

[Verse 4: KRS-One]
Ring-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding
This a K-R-S with a different something
What, come in a dance and we come down for sing
This a KRS me say, go!
'Nuff slaveships come from Africa
Full of Africans, sold in America
Now you want me to call myself American
Even though America kill the African
Check it, white man is European
And black man is African
White man never say Euro-American
So why should the black man say Afro-American?
If the black man is American with a afro
Then the white man is American with a long nose
It should be Long-Nose-American for the white man, and
Jump around and move your bottom, what

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Chuck D]
Make no mistake, we don't shake or stutter
So heed the word of the brothers
Who makes a boy into a man
It's the job of another man
Who knows his role as a father
He bothers to give his son his soul
And pass it on, to never flunk
Cause papa don't raise no punks
Got to make it known and to pass it down
Yeah, sounds like a job for the brother man now
Got to help a mother for me, uh
Each one teach one, if you can't find one
Talk to the little ones
And you'll see they'll listen
To fill the missin'
Peace, to rise and shine

Cause it will make your nose grow like Pinnochio
Since I was only 15 I had to listen
To what was said for my parent was a christian
I went to school and saw all my friends do it
But I said no cause I don't want my nose to grow
They started tripping on me, busting and flipping on me
So I had to front and say yo, true, stick it on me
I started smoking to prove I'm an adult
Now it's a habt but is it all my fault
I wished my mother would have told me the truth
Cause now I'm all based out, ma dukes

Now why won't you do is kick a little Freddie Foxx

Everybody rise as I present to a jet black crowd
What it's like to be black and proud
In a world where white is right but not tonight
This is a black man's might
I heard a sister say she don't like darker shades of black
On a man cause that's wack
But to my light skin sister can't you tell
You're just the surface of a dark deep well
And how can you prefer to be wit those
That sprayed you wit gun and hoses
And never put roses on the graves
Of the slaves that they treated like dirt
After all that hard work

Clap your hands to the beat, C'mon, just clap your hands to the beat

One of the biggest lies you hear from no one else
Is when a girl tries to say she don't do it to herself
Always fantasizing but steadily denying
Last night she had to stop cause her baby was crying
She do it on the phone all alone wit a smile
Run the water, grab the shower cap and get buckwhyled
Soap suds on the floor, oh Al B Sure
Give it to me, give it to me, give me a little more
I'm fiending, creaming, screaming, dreaming (what else)
The girl's possess by the basehead demon

In Elementary, Lyte had the Jordache look
Like me and any other kid who cared about books
But then I got wise and I begin to listen
To the wack teachers and the wick-wack system
My mother put me in nyeusi shule
Which means black school in Swahili
And there is where I learned black history
And how to be the best that I can be
I went back and now the school is closed
There is nowhere for black youth to go
To be taught by brothers and sisters who knows what it means
To be a black child or a white teen
In the end the youth is being mistreated
Which means the world is being cheated

Dane was never taught her life was worth something
But when people don't try to improve it makes me want to hurt something
You want to be somebody and be a standout
But got your handout, oh you're broke, I guess it's off to your man's house
Why is sister's giving up the ball
Today it seems not to father you too hard
They call us squeezers and you prove it to the worst
You have to earn the right to say it's ladies first

To open the eyes of humanity before it dies

Deep in it, walk, talk, sleep in it
Replenish, 3 minutes to start us something that's endless

[Interlude]
Gotta be a wolf out here to get this motherfucking money, man
Y'all niggas running around here tied together by love, trust, and respect
None of y'all be tied together by lust, fear, and greed and don't give a parakeet fuck

[Verse 2]
Direct dispute, bad boys on the rise
Press the mute if your barrel width ain't quarter sized
Get lost if your thoughts is unorganized
The cost is short but I fought with the taller guys
Hate them loudmouths, niggas that wild out
Let off a few shots, hit nothing, then hide out
Get snitched on, surrounded and bribed out
Disarm misinform 'fore they find out
Time is up, state greens is laying for 'em
No liars to trust, since eighteen moms's playing for 'em
Shawty, this is real talk for ya
Niggas will walk towards ya and Tom Sawyer your coil

[Interlude]
What the fuck you know about going the full fledged motherfucking Oscars, nigga. Get the wind beneath your feet and start dancing with the wolves like Kevin Costner. Made capo rank, nigga. We was outsmarting people who was paid to think

[Verse 3]
We all balling to see the niggas is scoring or
Hearing that war up North, hearing the morgue is all
Trying to stay afloat with it
Become a part of the system, want to work and cope with it
Convert, it's smart thinking when the heart weaken
And the skin start to darken, body parts start squeaking
Stay creeping, that's my motto for the '04
Oversecure, prepare for that Cold War
Love the cashflow, the streets, the fast dough
The beef, the Mac blow, you sleep, you asshole
Don't stop 'til you paid or you knocked off
Laying in the box, I'm the greatest since Pac

[Interlude]
Nigga this is Rilo Wonder, nigga, the rap Rich Porter of the New World Order
And I've been in the game since I was too young to fuck, nigga
Playing the U-quartro-O-W nigga
University of 40 Grove Street
And in that time, got a lot of real niggas
3 AZ's to be exact
One of them from Jersey, my man Darnell Horns just beat 5 murders in 2 week ? in the fed joint
Other one from Harlem, nigga, AZ Faison
A transcender of the motherfucking game
Nigga used to come through the 88 joint in '86
By the Rucker, throw a thousand dollars up in the air
Last but not least, Anthony Cruz, nigga AKA Sosa
One of the greatest emcees to ever grace the motherfucking microphone, nigga
Now I feel he ain't reach his highest potential yet
I don't think it was the raps
Maybe it was the machine, the label or something that he was in
Maybe it was the management
But anyway, we ain't blaming no motherfucking body, man
Cause y'all know AZ mean ""Almighty zig zag knowledge wisdom understand and complete"" nigga
But today, that A stands for the law of inertia
Meaning wanting something to get out and it's so hot
The public need like a crackhead need his crack, a dope fiend need his dope, and it can't be muthafuckin' stopped
So y'all need to go out and get this album, The Final Call
Before y'all miss one of the greatest rappers to ever grace the mic impeach their legacy

Verse 1
(FKI) There's only one place where we can go
To see freaky Girls doin' shows
Doin' tricks to make us holler
On a giving night, all for a dollar
Silicone breasts, all on their chests
Nothin' like others, but above the rest
They'll do anything to turn us on
Them girls got it goin' on!!

Girl, you know you've been have by many
So come and be my private dancer

How hard? Hard like a rock
When you make that Coochie pop!

Chorus(2x): Luke
Pop that Coochie! Heyyy! Pop that Coochie, baby!
Pop that Coochie! Pop, pop that Coochie, baby!

Verse 2
(FKI) Freaky girls with plenty of Class
Rollin' to the music and shakin' real fast
Bend over backwards, make me shout
And work that body, in and out
Movin' their body with plenty of action
Bringin' to the men more satisfaction
Doin' what they feel to turn us out
Just work that body all the way out!
(BM) Shake it! Don't break it!
It took your momma nine months to make it
Bend over and spread 'em, girl
Show-w-w me those country pearls
Play that button you know real quick

Girl, you know you look so cute
Throwin' that Coochie the way you do!

Chorus

Verse 3
(FKI) Poppin' that Thang a dance for the ladies
Straight from the South, into the 90's
Freaky girls are the ones I like
In G-strings in the middle of the night
Smoke-filled stages, women in cages
Guards at the door, armed with gauges
As they dance and I get hot
Keep throwin' that Body! Don't stop!
(BM) I like the way you get the champagne glass
It makes me wanna Blast Off Real Fast
So come on, baby, and pop it quick
I fall in love when you Can't Sit

[Verse One: Haas G. (Kool Kim in parentheses)]
Castle on the borderline is surely like this
Approaching of a UMC is purely hypeness
(A fact) so I mention is again and again
(It's not necessary) those who comprehend my message very clearly
But not along the way I'm translucent
Throw your hands up for the man who sent
Invaders of my fruit basket to a casket
Bein' done away (see the flocks run away)
So as a UMC, I ask myself who can be the leaders
Resembling the stars ought to fall
(Well it's you Haas G.) and that's a find the coolest in me
At a whim who would freeze blue cheese
Spin a 360 on a runway
Stop, and hear many more than just one say
""U-N-I-V-E-R-S-A-L"" (Go on)
Cause we gave em all one thought to grow on

[Kool Kim]
I frame my method, my method is apparent
I see clearly, this world's transparent
So I reach down deep
Deliver salvation to the hands of the weak
The meek, the mild, then tame the wild
Cause that's how I'm styled
The wizard of rhyme, my symbol is AU
In layman's terms, gold, so watch me shine through
A new zoo review coming right at you
And you and you, Kim is coming through
I grow on cause my strength is that of two
If rhyme's a boat, the beat must be my crew
A mental ingredient, all of which is alarming
Not harming, better said disarming
As I disarm you, I neutralize your weaponry
To make you more appropriate to deal with me
And then I give you one to grow on

[Haas G.]
Grow on this when you're feeling kinda small
Grow on this to get through life all
Grow on this to have fun for the creator
Grew and grew, and when the time came play the
Old flow short now I'm wicked to the port of authority
You and I vers' the majority
Here's what we're looking at, here
At the count of three let's hear the UMC cheer

:1, 2, 3...:
:UMC's is the new way of being!:

[Kool Kim]
Grow on this to make you life seem great
Grow on this to take control of your fate
Grow on this until you finally understand
Grew and grew and now the boy's a U-man
Sit beside the shoreline and think about your woes
Read the whips and way, identify your foes
The realize the sense of this existence
There's great resistance to the minds that mix this
Yes I've made things known, but then again I'm on the down low
Cause it's obvious because my methods show
That I rule on three planes of reality
Universally, Mystically, Conceptually
Then in due time, you may find
That I'm living in the world of my design
And I gave you one to grow on

[Verse 1: Chi-Ali]
Little girlie listen to me, stop giggling and kissing to me
Try to refrain from playing the childish games
And from your notebooks please erase my name
Kill the love letters, cause yo, you're living lame
I'm making records, my head didn't go swell
Chi-Ali is just too advanced for show and tell
Don't get offended, there's no need for insecurity
Age is but a number, it's all about maturity
So don't think I'm dissing, I'm educating
Until I think you're ready, I'm waiting
But now I reach ya like a book I must delve
Boyfriend after boyfriend and you're not even twelve
Bought your brush, you don't need to debate
Honey save yourself for Chi and I'll be worth that wait
Two or three years, don't be pressured by your peers
Surrender and you'd better be prepared to shed tears
Remember mom and the things you learned about
Cause I don't need a girl that's 14 and burnt out
Take my advice, think twice
In order to be with Chi-Ali you have to pay the price
Of being older, mature, a woman I'll endure
And if you try and diss me, I'll play you for sure
In four or five years or more
But for now, remember, that the

Walking down the street and I saw this honey
She was dipped, the opposite of bummy
I stepped to her, I said ""Yo you look swell""
Give me your number, you have a man, I won't tell
It really don't matter cause to me it means nothing
Next time I'm feeling rough, I'll just snuff him
Anyway, how old are you G?
""13"", I'm Audi
The girl said, ""Hold up, who you think you are?""
I said, ""I'm Chi-Ali, a superstar""
She said, ""I may be young but don't be mislead
With this dope body you'll choose me instead""
I said, ""Don't get me wrong, your body may be ready
But come back in three years when your mind is more steady
I'm not trying to diss you, I'm just trying to blow up""
But do me a favor, hon, and grow up, cause the

Downtown the Village, I see this fly cutie
Crazy thick, freshly dipped, with a fat doobie
I didn't waste time to kick my game
I stepped to her, I showed no shame
I said, ""How you doing? My name's Chi-Ali""
She said, ""Yeah, you're the one from TV""
I said, ""Yeah forget that, give me your name and number""
She said, ""Chill, maybe if I was younger""
I said, ""How old are you?"" She said, ""17""
I said, ""So what? I could get in between""
She asked my age, I said ""Is that what you wonder?""
Don't sweat that G, cause age is just a number
It's all where your head is at, and I'm mature
Do I have money? Of course, I'm doing tours
So stay out of my pocket and everything will be splendid
I make my money, so I will spend it
Damn, I thought with you I could go steady
But now I see that your mind is not ready
Your body says ""woman"" one of the flyest in the world
But mentally, you're just a little girl

It doesn't seem like
I'll be going nowhere
I'm just a victim of the ghetto
It doesn't seem like I'll be
Getting too far, too far

You know, Tone
It really ain't that bad
Once you understand
The science of this shit
College Boyz coming to you
For the year 2000
Covering all sectors
Of the universe
Creep through the hood
With my drop top
Gangstas on the sidelines
Throwing up nothing
But a peace sign
Brothers on the curb
With the herb
Levis, knee high
O.G's clock as I creep by
Crib to crib
Grown ups to kid's girls I did
They all know me
So the ghetto stays cozy
Fiends and teens
Sport a couple of trophies
One for the dope man
And the other for the homie
The ghetto's a real
Cool place to be fucked up
Sundown to sunup
But that's the way we come up
You talk with the street slang
You ball and you gang bang
That's where the family hangs
So it ain't no thang

[Chorus]
It doesn't seem like
I'll be going nowhere
I'm just a victim of the ghetto
It doesn't seem like I'll be
Getting too far, too far

[Repeat Chorus]
Yeah, it's like a family affair
If you get through
Plenty of old cuts
Say, what's up
Keep your mouth shut, yup
High rollers know me
But they don't own me
(Fuck you)
5-0 might roll through quite slow
Keep the forty in the bag
And throw away the Zig Zag
Waiting for five or six to come
Down goes the sun
So we can run a game of 21
Call me anything
From a hoodlum to a thug
You can push and you can shove
And I still won't budge

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
I'm just a victim of the ghetto
Won't be getting too far, too far
I'm just a victim of the ghetto
Too far, too far, no
Movie stars, yuppies
Macs and politicians
Roll through to get
A nickel or a ten
They know me, I know them
But then again I can't extend
More than I need to
Cause suddenly, they read me
And lead you astray
And transactions completed
Your presence in my ghetto
Ain't needed, so beat it
Born and raised on
The same damn concrete
And I'll be put to sleep
In these streets
I step into a different world
For college education
Keep my safe ways
Pay days stays in effect
I just can't let go
I want my respect so
I gotta return to the
Nation of my ghetto

[Repeat Chorus]
I'm just a victim of the ghetto
Too far, to far
So know you now
College Boyz sending out a fistful
To the Baytown Posse
Concrete Evidence, the CB Posse
My main man, TJ
Omega Psi Phi, Overdose
Suicide, Homicide
DOA and Genocide
And to the law
Keep your ass on the
Other side of the tracks
This is The Q signing out
On radio fusion radio

Cameras and light won't affect the matter...

Yeah, I know your nerves are wrecked to hear a woman
That's a rebel
Well, you heard the bass, but Souljah's the treble
The experts, the scientists, PhD's
Souljah pays no homage to a paper degree

Got ya drippin and sweatin, you can't believe what I said
Wait for me to change my mind, hold your breath

Nine o'clock in the morning, yes, I got dressed
Thought about my girl with the big fat breast
So I called her up and asked could I see her today
She said okay, so I said, ""I see ya Shante""
Hung up the phone, then I threw on my clothes
I pulled some tissue off the roll to blow the boogers out my nose
Put on my chain and my boots and things
Bout to step out the house and heard the telephone ring
I grabbed the telephone just to see what was up
She said, ""Gimme the place and time and we could hook up""
I said, ""Okay then, why don't you meet me in the park?
At a quarter to five, cause at six it get dark""

I said, ""Yo, just take this dollar and get yo butt on""
I bailed five or six blocks with a skip and a hop
Mmh... what's that smell? Oh, the flower shop
Now I pulled a lotta girlies out they panty hose
And never never have I ever bought a chick no rose
But that day I had to be the Life Saver
To top it all off, I rushed to 31 Flavors
The girl said she loved me, she said I was cute
But all I thought about was just knockin her boots
I thought about doin it with no hesitation
Now I'm sittin in the park just waitin

I seen my homies comin and my butt puckered up

I grabbed the roses, tried to hide 'em behind my back
But I was stuck in a - ouch - caught in the act
Then a old man walked up to me
He said, ""You know, whatever will be, will be""

This is how it should be done (Pump, pump, pump that bass)

Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
Why you wanna do me so bad (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
Why, why me, baby
Girl, tell me why, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
You broke my heart

This is how it should be done [Pump, pump that bass]

[LL Cool J]
Let me tell you what happened to me
Couldn't believe my girl was down with O.P.P
I went to the movies to get her off my mind
And saw her holdin' hands with the next man in line (Ooh the next man)
So I jumped in my Benz in a fury
But first I took back all my jewelry (All my jewelry, babe)
Reminiscin' bout the things that I gave her
Teachin' the crab how to roll with the flavor (Ooh, yeah)
Fingers, navels and ears look chunky
Then she flipped the script and cold got funky
(Sho got funky with me, babe)
Hair's done, nails lookin' polished
But here's two dollars, now take the bus back to Hollis (Ooh, yeah)

[Hook]
Why, why me, baby (This is how it should be done)
Why you wanna do me so bad
Why, why me, baby
For you I sing this song
Why, why me, baby
You broke my heart (Pump, pump, pump that bass)

[LL Cool J]
It all started when I was drivin' in my Cougar
Didn't have no dope, yet schemin' to maneuver (Maneuver)
On my way to the grocery store
Dress was whack and the girl was raw (Girl was raw, yeah)
And as I stared in her eyes I realized she had potential
Gettin' her number was essential (Had potential)
217-633 somethin' is disconnected
I can't believe she frontin' kid (Ooh)
Next time that I seen her, I rolled on her crew (Yeah)
What up, Miss, that's how you do (Ooh)
Cuff, snatched her, grabbed her by the neck (Oh, yeah)
Slobbed her down with all do respect (Ooh, why)

[Hook]
Why, why me, baby
Why you wanna do me so bad (This is how it should be done)
Why, why me, baby
I'm begging, little girl, I'm so all alone
Why, why me, baby (Then I kicked it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, babe (Marley Marl, take us to the bridge)

[Keith Sweat]
Girl, you did me wrong (You did me wrong, babe) girl, I'm all alone
Tell me why you did not tell me why, tell me
Baby, just take my hand, I don't understand
Tell me why you did the things you did, baby
(Pump, pump, pump that bass)

[Hook]
Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
Why you wanna do me so bad
Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
Sometimes girl I'm up for all night long
Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
You broke my heart (Pump, pump, pump that bass)

[LL Cool J]
Two years and a hundred grand later
35 packages on the escalator
Eaves dropping at the mall like ""I Spy""
I seen her runnin' up on this kid from ""Do Or Die"" (Mmm, babe)
Rushed the scene like a wild vigilante
My girl is givin' up the skins, oh no it can't be
Another brother is tastin' her toes
Makin' her sweat, damn, and everybody else knows

[Keith Sweat]
Was it good (Yeah) was she right (Yeah)
Every night did she hold you tight (Yeah)
Nice and tight, did she fight (Mmm, hmm)
Did she flip you like dynamite (Word up)
Was she hot (Yeah) hot to trot (Uh-huh)
Did she really, really hit the spot (You know it)

[LL Cool J]
Full of the chick and I'm sick of the chick
And I'm flippin' it on the remix
Pumpin' and jumpin' and bumpin'
Dumpin' the girlie in the mix (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, babe)

[Hook]
Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
Why you wanna do me so bad (Can I kiss it)
Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
For you I sing this sad, sad song
Why, why me, baby (Pump, pump, pump that bass)
You broke my heart (Pump, pump) (And L Cool and Keith wrecked it)

[Keith Sweat]
I know that you and me were meant to be
Baby, baby, baby, can't you see (Kick it)
Girl, look me right here in the eye
They say that a man ain't supposed to cry (Kill em' uh)
Get down on my hands and knees
And beg you, baby, please, please (Yeah), please (Played yourself, baby)
Don't break my heart (Played yourself, baby, that's how it is)
Yeah, yeah, baby

Why you wanna do me so bad

[Intro speaks: Kid Frost]
What is time?
Time is when a man is trying to make time with your woman
But you're doing time behind bars and your time is standing still
Yo, Frost, kick it to these people for real you know what I'm saying?

[Verse 1]
Time, sifts through the hourglass, through night and day
And I watch as the games people play
It's like do unto others than split
And if you can't back up what you say then you ain't shit
(Yeah)

I've seen the manifestations of the street
So I can manifest what I see on a drum beat
Like just last night
(Yo, what happened?)

I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight
One of them was quick to pull a knife
He stabbed him in the heart and now he's doing life
In prison at the age of 21
(Yeah)

Living on death row cause he couldn't let go
Caught in the web of violence
(Damn)
Roll deep when they creep and move in silence of the lambs
(Yo)
A tattooed tear dropped as the iron gates slam

[Hook]
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, anytime, hey
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, anytime

[Verse 2]
Damn, damn ain't that a shame?
You lost, so pay the cost, shouldn't of played the game
Should've listen to the Frost when I was trying to come across to you
But no you didn't think
(Sucker)

You just keep getting yourself more deep until you sink
So there's no one else to thank but yourself
So go ahead take bow for a job well done
But you'll never see the day of the sunshine or the fun times

Just the old days and your old ways
Corrupt and wicked
Out there doing dirt, instead of just kicking it
Pow pow, bang bang and all that noise
(Yeah)

Yeah, you and all your homeboys
Take time to read between the lines
Cause ain't no sunshine

[Hook]
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, anytime, hey
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, anytime

[Verse 3]
(Yo, Kid)
I know about being macho
Calling the shots the big time head honcho
(Yeah)

But here's something even more gacho
One of my homeboys is your old lady's Sancho
Yo, shit happens
A number lights up on his beeper right as I'm rapping

While you sit in a cell writing a letter
Saying when you get out, your things will be better
(Right)
But man she couldn't wait so she's going out on a date

With every Tom, Dick and Harry
And if you ask me, your shit's getting scary
So how you gonna handle this
When your ho's in Los Angeles, acting so scandalous?

Yo, you can't blame her you didn't take the time
And now, ain't no sunshine

[Hook]
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, that's for you, '92
You know what I'm saying? Anytime, yeah
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine, anytime, damn

So if you don't wanna do no time
You better take time to try to draw the line
You know what I'm saying?
Or you're gonna be the next fool in line doing time
You know what I'm saying? Like my man said

Ain't no sunshine, ain't no sunshine fool
Ain't no sunshine, ain't nothing happening up there
You know what I'm saying? Ain't no sunshine, anytime
Yo, me and Frost is out of here, peace

There just ain't no sunshine

Between love and hate
It's a thin line
Between love and hate

[Verse 1: Kid Frost]
Three in the morning
My pager reads your number
And at that point, I realized, you're starting to wonder
Where I'm at
What I'm doin' and all that
I could have called, but instead
I just sat back
Cause I've been calling you since ten
And now, it's three
I'm not your puppet on a string
So I'm letting you know
To set things straight
That's it's a thin line
Between love and hate

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2:]
I know it's wrong, you've been doing it big in love
So now it's time to let you know what's up
Do you remember
Early December, you told me, ""Don't
Come over, because
Of the cold and rainy weather""
But

[Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E.:]
Knock, knock, knock
Who is it
[Kid Frost:] Yo, it's Frost, girl
[Boo-Yah T.R.I.B.E.:] Let me in

Frost don't let me
Down
[Kid Frost:]
Well, you know I won't let you down
Just remember that

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]
It's
Five in the morning, and you're still tryin' to get through
Sweatin' the Frost for hangin' out with the crew
But baby
If this keeps going on
I came
And just like I came, I'm gone
We been through
Thick and thin
Good and bad
Arguments lost soon as I walked through the pad
But I knew you'd trip from the gate
Cause it's a thin line
Between love and gate

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 4:]
I know it's wrong, you've been doing it big in love
And now it's time to let you know what's up
Do you remember

Come over

[ VERSE 1 ]
I'm one bad muthafucka out the Nickel
If a boy think he rough enough, then tell him just step
Cause other than the Nickel, I ain't seen a man rough enough
To do the shit the niggas out the Nickel do, yet
Like in the Nickel ain't a night without gunshots
9mm's and them Uzis ain't shit
You better be prepared to shoot a gang of muthafuckas
Cause them niggas out the Nickel just love to click
And fuck a pussy up until a pussy can't see straight
Hear straight, walk straight, do shit straight
And brothers out the Ward'll kill a man with the quickness
Drive through South Park, you need a jimmy jam-plate
What them boys know bout 5th Ward?

[ VERSE 2 ]
A lot of ignorant muthafuckas out of 5th Ward'll
Deal with petty crime, and maybe snatch a bitch purse
You're probably sayin, ""How you still livin to tell the story?""
When you live in the jungle, you learn to shoot a man first
And I'm a nigga quick to shoot a nigga when his guard's down
Fuck that other shit, let me regret it when I'm done
Fuckin with the beat, to tell the truth, is kinda dangerous
Cause ever since a kid I never really caught one
I learned to shoot, let go if muthafuckas triple-crossed me
Never trust a bitch and learned to juggle cocaine
Keep a nigga's ass off of Liberty and Waco
Cause that right there's a corner the hardrock claim
Now many say that they done come up out of 5th Ward
Mingled with the roughest, and the toughest, and the best
If ever there's a nigga who you think ain't out of 5th Ward
I'm a show you how you put his ass to a test
Ask him where he from, and if he stutter, he a lyin ass
Brothers out the Nickel don't forget where they from
Ain't a bitch that a 5th Ward man ain't fucked
Ain't a muthafuckin crime his ass ain't done
Anytime you see em, that's a set of ex-convicts
Who plan to go back in it anytime, it's just when
A.K.-47 in the trunk with a Magnum
Bitch, you better run, because your ass can't win
What them boys know bout 5th Ward?

[ VERSE 3 ]
Now everybody know that 5th Ward's where I come from
So I'ma show a 4th Ward nigga where it'is at
Anytime he ready for the war, come check me
I walk by myself, and I don't look over my back
Cause who and all your posse and your friends and your family
Ain't never gon' be ready for the wrath of the king
So you and all your dancers that you call your little lynch mob
Ain't even got no business with your ass in the ring
Now Jazzie Redd, that's my boy and I respect him like a brother
Anybody try to diss him, in some deep, deep shit
I'm the first muthafucka with a record out of Houston
And last muthafucka you should wanna fuck with
At heart I'm still a Geto Boy, trigger-happy nigga
With the love for 'making trouble', and the hate for a snitch
Known to take your money, take your life, and take your jewelry
So how you gonna play me when you look like you would bitch?
What them boys know bout 5th Ward?

I've watched this crowd grow

I remember when we started
This week long party
And to think that it's over
It makes me want to spring break down

Yea, how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
But the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song

Next year I'll go through pictures
Wishin' I was down there with ya
Hanging out, it'll kill me then
But I'm here right now
So let's raise up our cups
Can't throw 'em up high enough
Let me buy you one last round
Before I spring break down

Yea, how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
But the sand runs out
And we roll back home

This is our last song

We made this sun tan city
And all of ya'll sang along so loud
We took this beach town over
You all do not know if might sound crazy
But you gonna make my spring break down

[Chorus]
Just think about all our good times together
And when we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
Ooo...but the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how

Swear I'm about to spring break down

Intro:

Yo, BK, whattup G?
[Yo whattup Cool?]
Yo man, lemme tell you what happened to me the other night
Right?  I was at my man's house watching the basketball game...
Stepped outside to the store
The police rolled up on me and told me I wilded somebody!
[Word?]
Word!  Cold cracked my head man.  Lemme tell you how it went...

Chorus:

The headcracker, the headcracker, the headcracker
[Head crack, head crack!]
The headcracker, the headcracker, the headcracker
[Head crack, head crack!]

Verse One:

It was a Saturday in May and we was coolin at the crib-o
Checkin out the game between Chicago and the Knicks
Sippin on a forty ounce and eatin some chicken
It wasn't Kentucky Fried, but it sure was finger lickin
Then I said, ""Yo G, we need some more brewski
So dig into your pockets and come out with some money
A dollar bill a piece, that's enough to get it started
I be right back y'all,"" and then I departed
I stepped out the door and headed straight for the liquor store
Recitin a funky rhyme well on the way as I go
I saw this cutie-pie with some light brown eyes
And told her she was lookin hotter than the 4th of July
And then out of nowhere the cops rolled up
And said, ""Put your hands up""
I said, ""Huh?  What?""

Chorus 2X

Verse Two:

Now they got me locked up for no reason at all
And everything was gettin hecitic so I asked to make a call
They told me not now, but maybe later if you could
I told em they was buggin and they misunderstood
They ran into my cell and threw me down on the ground
And started stompin on my back and told me not to make a sound
They hit me with a 1-2-3-4-5-6
A 7-8 a 9 or 10 and I was through buggin
I laid there in pain and more quiet than a church mouse
With speed knots growin on my head like rocks
And then they finally told me I was there for a robbery
That happened thirty minutes just before they spotted me
But I was at my homey's house watchin the game
And if you call his number they would tell you the same
The police laughed and said to tell it to the judge
But in the meantime kid, ya betta not budge

Chorus 2X

Verse Three:

My pops bailed me out and told me he was ashamed
That I could get myself arrested and disgrace his name
I told him, ""On the strength, you know me better than that!
This is a bad situation just because I'm black.""
I'm not the only brother to have a bright red jacket
And why did they have to beat me up and look at me laughin
They even told me that they had an eye-witness
But she never showed up, so the judge said, ""Dismiss this.""
And then I told him how they beat me and kicked me
And all he had to say is, he couldn't do nothin for me
I had to file a formal complaint against the city
And go against the cops for police brutality

Chorus 2X

Verse Four:

Now if you're not familiar with the word headcracks
It's anything that's kind of shocking or amusing, word
A funny type of saying is a headcracker
A fly cutie getting high is a headcracker
Your best friend having AIDS is a headcracker
Your lil sister turning tricks is a headcracker
Your girlfriend playing dirty is a headcracker
Yusef Hawkins being murdered is a headcracker
Vanilla Ice making records is a headcracker
And gettin robbed for your money is a headcracker

Chorus 2X

Outro:

Yo BK, you know what I'm saying man?
[Yo, now you know what the headcracker is all about]
Word is bond, I'm trying to stay in the house from now on man
I ain't even goin outside ya know [I hear that]
Yo man let's pack up the ring thing
Get the Kingpin, my man Pete, and lets roll out aight?
Peace.... see-ya!

You figured you was slick, dissin me for the next man

Now you wanna come back and act like it's all that
But I ain't tryin to hear it, cause you sound real wack
You got it over the first time, but that was the last time

She told me I could call her when I wanted to check her
And all I had to do to knock her down was respect her
To think about it, gee, that would be cool
To have a girl that's independent, with a job and school
So we took it slow, then we started to grow
Without a worry in the world, goin right with the flow
Until she cracked my head when she asked me to marry her
And move into a crib in some suburbian area
I knew that this was just too good to be true
And what you're askin me to do, girl, I cannot do
You told me, ""No committments"", and you best stick to it

Checkin out her profile to see if she got style

Forget the foreplay, and let's get down to business

But still I kept strokin till her boots were smokin
And left her on the bed with her legs wide open

I'm (easy!) easy, easy like Sunday morning
I can kick a stupid nervous joint when I'm yawning
Ahhh, Common's comin' with that old ""oh excuse me""
Elizabeth, this is a big one, I mean a doozie
Doogie, Howser, cause see, I'm like Bowser
Kickin it with the sha-na-na-na, the t-shirt
And the trousers, how's the Family Ties?
I'm left with the gift, open it up, SURPRISE!
Big Mac, filet-o-fish, quarter pounder, french fries
Icy Coke, milkshake, sundaes and apple pies
And a cup? Nah, that's enough of that
I'm like an Indian giver, yo, give me that back!
Comin again hip-pop-pop-pop bring it back selector
We be the thoroughbred, so use your head, play the Trifecta
Common infector, smug MC, heads up!
Ya better duck cause muthafuck', it's me
[Now what's your name] Common
Come in again... Common
[How would you do it] Common
[Now how was she] Common, check it out!
Common is coming soon to a theater near you
To the UAC crew, enough respect due
Do I do, when I do, where I do
I do, do, do, yo I do it on the ease

[Verse 2]
I be kicking it with the doubly-dope rhymer
I'm trippin-and-dippin-and-slippin with the rhyme like Sliiiii-mer!
(Who ya gonna call?) Ghostbuster
I'm Petey Wheatstraw, and I'm just a
Hustler, I tried to scheme for a sec
But the record got wreck, tried to write a bad check
So I checked myself, before self got buck
Wild, tried to live how I had to fluctuate
To a state, and matriculate, yo I had to elevate
You can tell it's great, cause I'm state
Off 87, the South side of Chicago
Five-oh-one come follow me yo, everywhere that I go
And I know I ain't did nothing [hell naw]
The district think I be just a lil trick kid fronting
UAC got my back if there's any contact
In the back is a track from Immenslope soul cat
And it's phat, sorta like Oprah before she lost weight
I put my rhymes in good hands, hey like All State
And I'm all in a state of ease, utopia
I'm the Spiderman, givin bug MC's arachnaphobia
Holy-molia, it's totally awesome
The survey says, I gets more skins than Richard Dawson
But I won't catch mono or no type of disease
Cause when I flex, for sex, I do it on the ease (Yeah!)

[Interlude]
On the ease, (Check it out!) On the ease (How?)
On the ease, (Now here we go!) On the ease (Yeah!)
On the ease, (Check it out!) On the ease
(Take it EZ!)
(Yeah... In fact, it's feeling so good, let's take it all the way back to the '50s!
Sing it!)

[Verse 3]
A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop, a-lop-bam-boo
I'm a Dr. Pepper, wouldn't you like to be a Pepper
Two-steppin' through, yodel-le-hee-hoo!
Oui oui ma cherie, et comment allez vous?
(Contraire mon frere) Ok, truth or dare:
Is it true that I'm dope? (Yeahhhh!)
Yippedy yes y'all, here we go a loopedy loop de loo
A hubbeda hula hoop, a hubbeda alley oop to Coop
I gots the Magic, but I'm not a Laker
I'm shaking-and-baking and taking, cause I'm the back-board
Break her arm and feather, whipping the wonder when she activates
Hold up! My drawers are in my crack, [aight] pass the tape
Time to activate, and ejaculate
This is the period where I menstruate (What!?)
I meant to say demonstrate
I'm in a state, where I've had too much eight, ball
In the corner pocket, count em, buck it
A chicken, a finger-lickin with a finger-bone
C'mon I'm on a roll, stippedy stutter-roll
Owah-owah-owah-owah Ayatoll
Of Khomein, my domain is infinite
Ya got trouble, well you need to get some dick
And to the hip-hop shop, the future shock
When we started kickin on the one two, and ya don't stop
But the buck stops here buckaroo
Ya got your instructions, now you know what to do
Take it EZ!

(Man... Matter of fact, we're gonna take it EZ so straight, so nice, we're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna STOP!!!)

One, two, three and I come with the wicked
Style, and you know that I'm from, the wicked
Crew, act like you knew
Cause I got everybody jumpin' to the voodoo, kick it
Wicked rhymes, picket signs
While me and the Mob gotta trunk fulla nines
Play ya and I'll slay ya
I got the mayor by the hair
Ready to BUCK BUCK BUCK and it's a must
To DUCK DUCK DUCK before I bust
Lookin for the one that did it
But like En Vogue, no you're never gonna get it
Cos I'm the one with the fat mad skills
And I won't choke like the Buffalo Bills
Sittin' at the pad just chillin'
Cause Larry Parker just got two million, oh what a feelin'
So shake that nigga and pass me the pill
And I'll slam dunk ya like Shaquille O'Neal
Like it, dig it, maybe
And watch that test tube baby, kick it
Cause I get wicked

Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin, never seen with a happy grin
Show the fat frown cause I'm down, take a look around
All you see is big black boots steppin
Use my steel toe as a weapon
Kick ya and flip ya, now they want to
Label this nigga' tape with the sticker
Diggin' out girls that's ""nicety""
Plus I gotta body count like Ice-T.

People wanna know how come
I got a gat and I'm lookin out the window like Malcolm
Ready to bring that noise
Kinda trigger happy like the Geto Boys

And we might just see a sequel
Cause police got equal hate
A chazzer's a pig that don't fly straight
Through with Daryl Gates but is Willie Williams
Down with the pilgrims?
Just a super slave
We'll have to break his ass up like Super Dave
I'm wicked enough to board this
Cause now it's on to the fullest
Gorilla straight from the mist

Bring the yellow tape

Verse: 1 ( ODM )
Well you ask me what the definition of a homie is
A friend till the end
But some start when you're kids
Little traviesos
That are always into something
Doing something bad
Acting like they did nothing
Well here's a little story about a homie named frankie
Had another little homie
That was down for hanky panky
Sort of like Spanky and Alfalfa, Little Rascals
Doing what they doing getting away without a hassle
Like going to the schoolyard for your late passes to class

Cutting in lunch lines leaving other students last
And strolling to the movies to see a rated ""R""
When mom's dropped them off it's where E.T. would be the star

Stealing was an issue that just could not be ignored
Taking tapes and 45's from the local record store
Being good kids to them was nothing but bologna
Cause this is what you do when it's you and your homies

Chorus

Verse: 2 ( DTTX )

My situation with my homies wasn't all fun
Sometimes bad sometimes sad, but had to have one
I wouldn't change it for a thing cause it's priceless
Your homies are your down, yup!  Can I get a righteous
As kids, we saw and we did what most kids never did
Took my first swig chilling at my homies crib
Searching for ways, so that we could make presidents
Life was hard beign a product of my residence
But me beign the youngest, I had to stay strong
Mom's was my teacher cause Pop's was already gone
Hung out in the streets doing my own thing
Living in the barrio, but I never gangbanged
Coming up was a must, growing up with who I grew up
I found out just who I can trust
Me, Myself, and I not fronting like a phony
I'm true to the game and I'm down with my homies

Chorus

Verse: 3 ( ODM,DTTX )

You wanna be my homie well hey I'll tell you something
Hanging with my crew doesn't really mean nothing
Blabbing when I get all toured doing my songs
You gonna want to kick it, well listen up here holmes
It goes way back before you ever knew me
I hung with my friends and not male groupies
Just goes to show everybody where I'm coming from
Hey yo! D' break em off something

( DTTX )
So many people wanna hang now that I'm in the rap game
They say that they're down when they dont even know my name
Well I could say that I have many friends
But a homie is true, through and through until the end
And ain't a damn thing changed
We're still hanging in the hood and doing the same thangs
Cause I ain't one to be a phony
I'm still true to the game and I'm down with my homies

[Intro]
Oh yes this is special
This is direct from what we call
The Funk House
This is a Tony Dofat one
Know what I'm sayin
And this is how it's done

[Verse One]
I did good in my hood as a youngsta
The Heavster was never a punkster
No sir No ma'am
Hot damn, me and Michael Jackson jammed
I dug Soul Train, not American Bandstand
The bigger nigga is back
And I'm on the right track
As a matter of fact, I'm all that
So ring around the Rosie, oopsy-daisy
Topsy turvy, you never heard of me
You don't deserve me
Fly like an eagle, drive like a BMW
You never knew I could bring trouble to
A cordless you can't afford this
Don't get aboard this flavor
Unless you got the fever flavor for a Pringle
Could be a single
Let me see you mingle jingle dangle
Sammy Davis Jr. was Mr. Bojangles
(Here is something you can't understand)
Tell me y'all, who's the man?

Yes, too many brothers be fakin moves
And frontin' grooves
Peace to all the brothers on the block
Drinkin' and passin' brews
Money tried to flip but he got flopped
Said it was his corner
Let him know his corner's on my block
I know your fantasy
Don't Stay, I ain't Jodeci
When I used to juggle [?] for crumbs
You didn't notice me
But now you see me in a magazine
On your TV screen
On the radio, live in stereo, looking clean
All of a sudden I'm attractive
I'm handsome, I'm gorgeous
But back in the day you used to say
""You can't afford this...""
I wreck shops and got props
From New York to Cali
I'm Big Willie, you silly Sally from the valley
Ain't nuttin' changed
Wait a minute, I'm a liar
The crib is definitely doper and the girls a lot flyer
(Here is something you can't understand)
So tell me y'all, who's the man?

[Hook]
Who's the man?

Who's the man?

Who's the man?

Who's the man?
Who's the man?
Yes, who's the man?
Who's the man?

Like I said, this here, is official

[Verse Three]
Back in the day I used to punch clocks
Now I'm drippin props
And counting loot, and shootin hoops
And looking cute
In tailored suits
Made for the overweight lover
Undercover, over cover
You know my M.O
I do damo on the stage show
I'm gettin' paid by the pound and I got mad flow
Flip flop who's the bigger one
Quick to figure
One, two, 3-2-1 (ah!)
Keep a pen and a pad on stash
I used to [?] the last
Now I flow for dough, and I rhyme for cash
I'm glad to say goodnight to Johnny Carson
And brother wear you rubber
Before you catch the Magic in your Johnson
Honey dips, money grips
I know the difference cause I learned tricks in the ghetto mix
(Here is something you can't understand)
So tell me y'all, who's the man?

[Hook]
Who's the man
(Time keeps on slipping)
Who's the man
(Time keeps on slipping)
Who's the man
(Time keeps on slipping)
Who's the man
(Time keeps on slipping)

[Outro]
Everything here, is phat
Know what I'm sayin?
Don't take it the wrong way
But I'm lettin you know
For the last time
This here is official
Respect

[Intro]
Check me out, y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

[Verse 1]
Before I blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front; matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catching the Jungle Fever
King poetic; too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number, like a pager
‘Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is giving me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'm a performer, strange
So the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it? You know
You got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme; it's halftime

[Hook]
It's halftime
This is how it feel
Check it out, how it feel

[Verse 2]
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle; now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise, ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks, and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches, like a faggot
But not bisexual; I'm an intellectual
Of rap I'm a professional, and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man
You can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets I'm well-known, like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap and tell me, ""Nas ain't all that.""
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon; the real rap comes at halftime

[Hook]
It's halftime
This is how it feel
Check it out, how it feel

[Verse 3]
I got it going on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless, like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey; I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' them fast, doing this that and the third
But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay, and hit a matinee
Putting hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds
Don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is living fat, and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace! Yo, I'm out

You say, ""Fuck Nell Carter, c'mon Jimmy, give me a break""
You made a mistake on the first take
Tryin to break a leg for take two
You shoulda ate your Wheaties
And Petey mighta made a breakthrough
You say to hope that things might bloom, so you assume position
Wishin he would listen, so you start to kissin
It's alive, and up goes, and up goes you're adrenaline
You aimed, you fired, THERE YOU GO, limp figures
So you take ? and then play the role of friend and talk
Try to tell her it's her fault, when Jack your Been wouldn't Stalk
Baby Bubba you's a goner, ahh, you's a goner
It's fucked up, when Your Dick Is Playin Tricks On Ya
So you pop fizz, what a relief, beef strokin'-off
My man, got your thing, in your hand, say, ""I I think I can!""
Damn this never happened before, yeah sure that's what they all say
Uh-oh you better get Maaco kid, cause old girl is salty
What was sweet to eat, has now dried up and rotted
It's a pile of pew, pick up your glove and say, ""Yo I got it!""
Hopin you won't drop you thought you had it made like ?Kay?
What more could go wrong - you got the right one baby!
Uh-huh, let you tell it, everybody and their momma knows
That you came quick, quicker than a pizza, from Domino's

To the break y'all (break y'all, YEAH)
To the break y'all (break y'all, MAYBE)
To the break y'all (break y'all, NAHHH)
To the break y'all (break y'all, check it out)

The 1/9, the 1/9, the CB's, the break
The 1/9, the 1/9, the CB's, the break!
The 1/9, the 1/9, the CB's, the break!!
Break it up, break it up, break it up, BREAK DOWN!

Walkin up and then down the strip
Lookin for some hip so I can skip
I spotted this honeydip, and her friend tried to sell me a script
That they were in a rush to catch the bus, but that was the OLD Gus
So I'm gettin a bus, as I thrill at the disgust
Since old girl was with this, I told her friend to kiss this
And listen physical fitness use your brain and mind your business
Dippin from a distance, in an instance I got the digits
And blew a kiss to her
(THAT OLD STANK HOEEEE) was mad I didn't speak to her
I hooked up with the one that looked NICE
Took her mind, like an ICE
'Til her friends gave her advice to think, twice
Before with me she slept, my rep was kinda ill
They told her to keep that booty still
I been through more hoes than the pill
Still I overcame cause I got game like a athlete (UHH)
In less than a half week, she was with it to do the nasty (BREAK)
The drawers dropped, the top off, and the boots was gettin knocked
I heard the door unlock, it was her pop he was a cop
So I stopped dropped and rolled, so I wouldn't inhale a shell
Broke like a fingernail, on my trail was the smell of tail
Bailed back around the flat, to wash off the smell of cat
Like a belt, everything was strapped
'til my homey asked, ""WASSUP WIT DAT?""
The dat was like dis G, I told him I got busy
This was the spy who dissed me cause he told it like a sissy
THAT WAS FOUL, I went to him lost in the mind now it's a dead end
The little red Corvette that locked the door and I can't get in
No more no more no more and now I know and now I know
Don't mess around with CB's, good buddie, ten-fo'

(Ha hahh, yeahh, ahh break it..)

Verse One: (Markie Dee)

One minute you're so fly and now you're busted
Sweetheart, we got a lot to discus kid
Your relationship is wavering
Don't walk away, come here and listen
Cause I speak straight up so they attract
I'm sorry baby but your man ain't all that
Before you verbally stomp me, just wait a sec
And explain why you're always looking wrecked
By now any other lady would have just had it
Looking depressed at battered, shattered
Dreams of you two being the perfect item
The feelings you had try to fight them
Cause your man's a conniver so stay alert
Mark my words you're gonna get hurt
Does your man abuse you physically or mentally?
Change what I put, slavery you need to be free

Chorus:

So maybe you need to swing my way
Markie Dee can do you right in a fly way
I'm the one you should chose
Girl you won't be abused
So maybe you need to swing my way
Maybe you need to swing my way
Markie Dee can do you right in a fly way
Not like the man you're with now, I keep my hands to myself
So maybe you need to swing my way

Verse Two:

Mistreated you like a towel
And when he gets busted he thinks that he's an owl
Your eye is puffy, your jaw is swollen
You shouldn't be smacked, you're made to cuddle and hold an
Cores and snuggle like a Teddy Bear
His attitude's changed, begins to put fear
In your heart, but you depart from being afraid
Many thoughts of leaving were crushed so you stayed
Saying what he did before he won't do again
He wants more of a lover and less of a friend
Catch my drift? You're put to the test so
You refuse and get struck with a left blow
He tells you in a flame way
""That's what you get for rejecting your man"" Hey
Now you're crying on the floor
Your man's no damn good, need I say more?

Chorus

Verse Three:

Now I'm not saying I'm an angel, I got many associates
I treat them all right and appropriate
I'm not talking marriage and settling down
But I can treat you much better than that clown
No matter what I say you still seem to protect him
No matter the amount of times you're hit you respect him
Damn, if you only knew
How much affection could be given to you
If you move the right way which is my way
Forget what your so-called-boyfriend might say
You're too good for his kind
Widen your horizons and focus your mind
On a real man. I won't stress you or keep sweating it
I'll buy your clothes but pay your rent it's kind of pressin it
So tell me, who do you chose?
Here's an alter way then either win or can lose

Chorus (x4)

Maybe you need to swing my way

Once again, it's on
Where I'm from there ain't no picket fences pick it
Straight and ruff so you pick it my sticky finger was a Glock
Many dash for the fast cash, but I like the cash to last
So I rap till my ass collapse
I'm never trouble but if troops will come and jam me
You Remind Me like Mary then I'm scaring your little projects
On the prarie I'm hairy and hot like Dougie with a smokie
So I boo-boo, just like Fu-Schnicks I'll say F-U-2
A-bibbedy-bibbedy-bibbedy-bibbedy-bong-gang ultra-king
But BBD boxing up yang, giddy-up
Didduh-duh, didduh-duh, didduh-dum dum dum
I'm coming again and again a Ku-Fu vomit
Gosh, darn it! Like we're lyin' to bits
The John-John Jacob lyrical shaker
Yes and Jengle-ma-heimershmitz
I sings my lyrical style from Flatbush
Quick to Greenwich Village
I'm strong to the finish
When I eats, me spinach
I'm one of the lyrical flava
My nigga Foxx is stompin faggots
Check my dum-dum-dum-dum-dum and step
Now I been breakin rappers down for a while now
Now it's time to break, child
Rappers get chopped like the head on a fat cow
I'm mister micraphone, rappers can't f*ck around
I'm Freddie the Foxx I'll brake it back and buck em buck em down
You know my rep I got a record like the turnpikes
When I was young they use to call me Freddie-burn-mics
But now they call me big Foxx, daddy boot-knocks
With burn marks on my hips from my twin Glocks
(Queen Latifah) I got flava for days
(KRS-One) Flava unit has a title
Roll With the Flava

Verse Four: Queen Latifah
Now it's about the time to put you out of sight and out of mind
I got the skills to blast you off the mic and out of rhymes
Now who the hell-am-I-a?
The L-A-T-I-F-A-H the motherf*ckin sire
I come in on time
You wear a silly grin we like we do when niggas in
We gotta practice so scalp the hairs off your chinny-chin-chin
The Flava Unit's got my back, so I'm quick to start shit
Get the short end of a bat, cause we beat him broken sticks
I-guy-guy-guy-guy-guy bet you never knew
That I could flow I flew I grow I grew
I blew up the spot, I'm sippin my props
And now I am just passin through
Ruff rugged rigid nigga, the one who's quick to figure
Some think they're big, but the heavster is bigger
The funky flip-flop flava unit, my hip-hop neigbor doin it
Came to the studio, check my flow, and ran right through it
I bet you thought I wouldn't come, I came
I'm never done till I'm done rippin drums like a shotgun, ohh!
Now ladies, what's my name? (aaah)
That means it's time to go
I'm the same muuuhf*cker from it's time to flow, so
Some might have dissed the way I flow it out
Niggas need to throw it out
Simply cause it's somethin you don't know about
So watch the Nice man shake the ground
And now I'm Rollin with the Flava cause
The Flava's what I'm rollin in my sound
To make you get down, rippin the sound from J.C. to Uptown
Now
Now if you got a nine, and you got a nine
And you got a nine, and you got a nine
And he got a nine, and she got a nine
Well it's a motherflockin party yo cause I got mine
So bust it the Black Sheep are (where?) here (where)
Here (where) there, everywhere there's a Jeep
There's a Sheep beat beatin up the air
Graphic as illustratin frustratin like waitin
The Sheep are a joke? Nigga you playin
Yo I drink twenty forties, smoke forty blunts
Say a hundred rhymes and not sound like you once
Twice, three times, nigga never figured
You'd be triggered by Dres, that R and B smokin nigga
Doin it, screwin it, chewin it, well
Done on the weak bun hon can't you tell
Unification cells on the flava flingin
If a Queen has the balls my lady is a King
So long live the King, and love to my Unit
Spoon it and you'll croon it, diss it, and yo balloon it

""Well, ladies and gentlemen, without and further adieu
Let's just get on with the show""

Off and on!  (There it is, Baby Pah!)  * repeat 8X *

Verse One: Nastee (a.k.a. Crotch Ripper)

Off and.. on
Trender number two, NOW, whatchu gonna do?
When I.. flow
Cause, man, do the brother, flow
Like a swinger, oh yes a swinger
A regular humdinger, besides a ruff rhyme bringer
So when the Trend men come we come correct
Styles upon styles upon styles earn mad respect
Lethal as a tech nine, a Crotch Ripper rhyme
Here I COME-AH, tick tick it's time
For the slim dude to put his foot forth would more
Would agree, the Ripper seems to be, bon-jour good
The style FLIP the script, Nast
Show em that your skills are more than rhyme and diggin ass
People hear the name and equate me to sex
So when I drop BOMBS, damn do the brother flex
Cause I'm dowwwwwwwwwwn for ya
Versatile styles with piles of files that go for miles
C'mon, people, get with the Trender
Skin bender, known to render comp, knocked
Clearin microphones from block to block
With hip-hop I drop and I don't stop
Until the Trend men feel it's fit
Get with that nigga named Nast, and the fat hems..
I.. flip.. on ya
Here to California
Trends are skyborn, flowin, off.. and.. on..

Off and on!  (There it is, Baby Pah!)  * repeat 4X *

Verse Two: GrapeVine

I flow off and.. ahum off and.. on
Word is bond, from the nigga known night to morn
Hit my sun shout, feel fine, GrapeVine
With the one-liner, in front or behind a cut
Whaddya say?  What is.. up?
I bust a flow I bust a groove
I bust.. e..nough..
And from nothin leaves nothin
So I just sayin somethin to keep the crowd pumpin
Seems, that, my flow, is fat
So I let a melody go, black
But don't let it come on weak what happens then
Prrrrr-props to the paper, prrrrr-props to the pen
Trends of Culture, in the fullest
Hotties come in dozens so you know we can pull, this
Without delay we swing and sway and make the crowds go hey
We like the way the big ones play, whether night or day
Whenever, if I ever get the chance to
Release flavor, like I usually do
With my crew, cause Ripper, Music Of Life
And.. yours.. tru..ly..
G, flowin (off and on, off and on, off and on)

Off and on!  (There it is, Baby Pah!)  * repeat 2X *

Verse Three: M.O.L

We come with mad styles and whatever
But what else would you expect?  From a Trend-setter
Huh, pick up the pace and gimme bass I got the skills to theme
Scroungin up ? prettiest schemes, by any means
And ON the day of the funky drummer
We hear hip-hop nonstop, the newcomers of the summer
Trends we friends, and we go, in they go
And if you only got one blue shoe, you still, flow
Peace to the Prankster Posse, for not soundin sloppy
Swift and Jeff by the board makin sure our shit don't sound choppy
Can.. we.. ad-just, this
Nast.. help me, bust this

Verse Four: Nastee

Brother Nast, the rebel!  On another level!
You a boulder, well I'ma crush you down to a pebble!
Off and on the styles come, wreck, check-mate..
Wait.. on a hot.. date..
Seven *reversed* nine, six five eight, one
Call me when you're ready to grind
To Trends rippin skills, do it off and on.. rhyme
Trends, can I get a UHHHHHHHHH

To drop from the ball yes I'm, off and on
And off and on

She just come down DANGEROUS!

""Is that what time it is Boss?""
""Yo what the fuck is wrong with you?""
""This is deep, but I'm going deeper..""

[Verse 1: Bo$$]
I don't really wanna feel
Like I'm in a daze so I smoke big kill
Just to deal with the ills like this fucked up trip (damn)
My skills ain't paying bills
And it's fucking with me and my grip (I hear you)
I drink that St. Ide's shit
And smoke a ticket at the same time
Drop a wicked bomb on my naughty nature
I'm livin' foul like a Knickerbocker (you livin' foul?)
Bitch I'm not the woman to sleep but I'm lost (yo that's deep)
Cause I be on some ole' ""I'm tired of niggas""
Trying to come up off bitches type thing (""What can I do?"")
And if I don't react the way he want he might swing
His little trick bitch ass in another direction
Then don't even use protection
I hate stupid shit assholes can avoid
Yo! And if worse came to worse I'll run a fraud on unemployed
Cause who the fuck cares that I got gray hairs and can't sleep
Know what I mean? (Yeah hell yeah, that's deep)

Deeper and deeper .... ""What can I do?""
Deeper and deeper .... ""What can I do?""

""This is deep, but I'm going deeper..""

[Verse 2: Bo$$]
Every now and then I start flipping and get to thinkin'
Bout deep shit beyond all that bullshit
I shoot at people (yeah I know what you mean)
But fuck it I'm evil
And I'm hip to every bitch trying to get a grip
And every nigga trying to get a grip but fuck that shit
And I say fuck that shit with my mighty middle finger
I'm heavy off into this rap shit, bucking singers
Yo I think I'm getting tense (word?)
Cause my dollars ain't making no fucking sense; but then again
It's probably all that chronic that I smoked
I use to be like that when I was out there slanging dope
And lately I been flipping on some old paranoid shit
Like looking fuckers up and down trying to start shit (""What can I do?"")
Cause I'm a hard bitch (So why don't you just soften up?)
I try to be cool but I get caught up when I go to clubs, straight up
I don't even trust myself (yo, you can trust me)
Fuck I know? (I'm just like you)
Right, that's deep

Deeper and deeper ....
Deeper and deeper ....

(Yo Bo$$ that shit you talking bout that's some deep shit
I'm tellin you motherfuckers can't really get with that
Relate to that shit)

Hehehe, don't make me tell dem again mon, woyyy
She too hotta, tell-a-man she too hotta
Tell man she too hotta an' every posse know dat-ta
Yes, she too hotta, tell man she too hotta
For inside she come, she say de posse get flat come

[Verse 3: Bo$$]
Aye yo, I got them buck-wild thrills, living foul kills
I'm trying to get to Watts but I'm stuck in Baldwin Hills (damn)
Trying to find myself for real though, check it
If I just rewind myself I'll see it ain't that hectic
Y'all don't hear me talking but its time to get a stack
Cause I'm about a second away, from going back
To the corner slangin dope (now you know you don't wanna do that shit)
Gankin cluckers, jackin high, cappin marks
I may be losin' my mind but better that than my heart (I hear you)
I talk a lot of shit but I can back it all the fuck up
I'm real cool people until some bullshit get brung up
Look here, believe me I ain't comin out my crib
Tryin to snap on life and run out and do some dumb shit
So I'll be takin another sip to relax me
And get them problems out my mind that distract me
Life is workin on my last nerve (yeah I hear you G)
I'll see yo' ass next week, peace (yo that shit is deep)

So to the ladies if you're asking

No good, pussy hungry ass

Snoopin in my biz like tom and roxie roker
So bust a freaky freaky freaky ways

Making g's and now we're sellin records overseas
Holy smokes, oops your whole plan goofed up
Now you get licks now get kicks nuff licks now kuffed up

Nose so play dosey doe suffering succotash my mistletoe is gone
Snow white is after my seven dwarves my style and after me lucky
Charms, so leapin leprechauns be glad I'm pushin' my pedal
To the metal I'm rugged and rough for cocoa puffs yes and I love my fruity pebbles
So hody my partner I starts ta get meaner
So ask bob for hope not mr. bob dobalina
Oh here has my mic gone, tell me have you see her
I stretch like a condom, and gets plump lika a weiner
Or a sausage of course it's time for chip to wreck it

But before my intro I gots to mic check it
So who is the nicest in your neighborhood
Lyrics are merry merry quite contrary
And captain crunch berry good so rah rah sis boom bah
Chip fu is coming again give thanks and praises to jah
My lyrics are smooth like the head on terry savalas
My tongue starts to quicken like speedy gonzalez
Take up yor pen your pad your lyrical and bag and run go whole a fresh
Touch pussy cat put down that mic cuz you can't rap
Cuz I'm dip dip divin, so so socializin
Clean out your ears, yes and open up your eyes
And I kick like bruce lee and jean claude van damme

[Intro]
Attitude is... madness
Attitude is... personality
Attitude is... flexibility
Attitude is balls
Attitude is... talkin
Attitude is ways and actions
Actions and ways
Attitude is the Rump!

[Verse One: The Capitol L.S., Sha-Now (Remedy Man), Jeranimo]
[The Capitol L.S.]
I'm the one! That gets that deeper job done
Refuse to Jump Around and rhymin' like a burnt one
For them who pause, you got to get out of the midst
Split teeth grit, but your shit don't mean SHIT
Bustin' to the backs when Flip, Modes
Although I'm only XTO's
Beware of the vocal when I'm shinin' like gold
Get fold, I'mma slip into dangerous mode

[Sha-Now (Remedy Man]
Here comes the Now when I deal with aspect of
The loom and my attitude swells and a phone can't cop
No please don't freeze, lyrics are run to seige
I'm known as a mess, when I rhyme silly pleas
Bad boy big mouth, I smack you way south
Where the birds go, when the weather gets kinda cold
Use an instructive tongue or you get flunked
As I boot out my burner and I flank up your block
Knowing that you're one who pays a freaky cop
But I won't stop cause the Sha-Now just took your spot

[Jeronimo]
To the bump bass! Styles comin' down I need elbow space
I got mad stress hangin' off a face that's
Attitude I'm in the mood to be rump
Number one dump, niggas are pussy, time to hump
I'm gettin' ready for the skin
Go for sex I flex and throw mens
And shit pens and legends and clips
I'm the last Mohican, heat seekin' the bit
Hip-hop and rock when Jeranimo's rippin'
It's an Indian summer
Planet sounds is thumpin'
Oh goody gumdrop, there's props
Welcome to the ill got skills, chill
Hard knocks

[Chorus]
My attitude is fucked up, and real shitty! (8X)

[Verse Two: Jeranimo, L.S., Remedy Man]

[Jeronimo]
When it's Jeranimo, everyone, yell timber
This apache war, skin raw yeah enter
My inner, hardcore center hold scouts
I take space or racial thoughts with the doubts
We 'bouts about super superb on curbs
Kind of fresh guess best, press, the answer
Is yes, for nuttin' all over your face
And you don't have to say you're...
Damn, my attitude is rude
It's another bad mood, hahah release
Rumple-in', killin', skillin', original styles
No peace I shout, much stress and I'm out

[L.S.]
I would think eligible, always willin to tell a few
Rappers, dappers, butt skill rappers, that I'm about to
Blow up! In ninety-four or tomorrow
But yet, still flow, talkin' about super tracks
And lips gonna be flappin', and yappin'
Ten thousand plans...
Make it a thousand hands
Cunts simply chargin' to feel my funk
But they gets nothing but a bunch of jeep bump
Tell me something, what makes the female sex
Want to swing with a singer [laughter]
I got a partner he can sing but shhh, it's on the DL

[Sha-Now (Remedy Man)]
Wrap my fist grip it tight, break the skull on the mic
From my well fittin' rhyme that this Rump bring in sight
I love to see when the noise gets the crowd hype
In life for detention -- I need more affection
Thinking things with a feel of redemption
Soak the attention, I gets no detention
Finality shots ay what it's worth mentionin'
Too much funk with a touch be a Rump
Attitudes act up increase but never cease
When we feed the ears from China to Peru

[Chorus]
My attitude is fucked up, and real shitty! (8X)
Crossin' that line! (8X)
Crossin' that line, head for the border
Crossin' that line, head for the border...

[Big Daddy Kane: Verse 1]
Talk about ever meeting Ms. Right
But one thing I know is this girl is hype
Not a crab I see but such a lovely female
And if looks could kill, she would be in jail
For raving all over with exotic beauty
And to captivate her love is my only duty
There's not a single feature that this girl lacks
Sweetheart, you're my aphrodisiac

[Big Daddy Kane: Chorus]
You've got me waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find
So I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine

[Big Daddy Kane: Verse 2]
Now I've talked to young girls and sophisticated ladies
But I swear my dear, none appear on your level baby
Maybe, it's just me imagining
Then again, I probably just haven't been
With the right female and in detail
I'll probably never will be, girl if we fail
Cause every time I appear to be pleased
You know what happens?
I just get skeezed

[Chorus]

[Big Daddy Kane: Verse 3]
The girl that I admire, one that I desire
And no one can stop the feelings that you inspire
The way that you leave me in this obsession
With the chambers of my heart in your possession
We were meant to be together, always and forever
For that engagement, I shall endeavor
Pray for the day that we combine
And I can say for sure that you're truly mine
In benevolence and reverence
As soon as our relationship commence
But for now, I wait impatiently
For the day that you can give your all to me
[You've got me waiting for you day by day]
The moment of truth is what I really should call it
I worked so hard for it so please don't spoil it
Yeah it's a lot that I'm asking you to give me
That's only because I need you with me
Side by side, hand in hand
You as my girl and Kane as your man
Bust it, ever since the first time that I seen her
I wanted her to step inside my arena
I'd be the champion of love, wear the golden glove
And show you what a real man is made of
My feelings I'm sharing because I'm caring
My heart'll tell you why I am so endearing
For a chance at romance I would love to enhance
I would be your man under any circumstance
Just as long as I can say that you're my own
Your feelings for me and mine alone
We can cherish every moment of the time we spent
Try to take our love to the full extent
The point that I'm trying so hard to get through
Is girl, I'm in love with you

[Chorus]

[Big Daddy Kane: Verse 4]
A dramatic fanatic for our relation
Cupid has me stupid with infatuation
And a fashion of passion so tenderly
With vibes I can't describe you send to me
This personal attachment in which I feel
To you my dear, I will try to reveal
All over and over, I'll try and try
Because to see you with the next man makes me cry
I feel that I should be the only man to side you
Cause no one can love you the way that I do
No one deserve the love you can give
So allow me to show you how I'm out to live
With something very special, palliative and pure
And anything that you want, I can give you more
I'll be calm and gentle, loving and sentimental
Oh so much emotion, I'm talking devotion
Cause when I get involved, I get involved so deep
That you would know that my love is something special to keep
But for now, I guess I'll be fine
And keep waiting for the day that you'll be mine

Yo back up now and give a brother room
The fuse is lit and I'm about to go boom
Mercy, mercy, mercy me
Uh, my life is a cage but on stage I'm free
Hyped up, psyched up, ready for wildin'
Standing in a crowd of girls like a island
I see the one I want, I said ""come here cutie""
I flip her around and then I work that booty
Work the body, work, work the body
Slow down girl you're 'bout to hurt somebody
Hold up, yo let's get just one thing clear
There's only one reason why I came here

Out in the crowd and yo it was a good throw
How do I know?, because the crowd went (HO)
In response to the way that I was kicking it
Smooth, an individual, rhymes always original

But it gets worse-a but worse-a but-but-but worse still
I need the c-c-c-crowd to k-k-k-kick into it
They help me calm down and I can get through it
So higher higher, get your hands to the ceiling
Let it go y'all don't fight the feeling
Mic in a strangle hold, sweat pouring
And like Jordan yo I'm scoring
Yeah that's right y'all and I am in the flow
So pump up the volume, along with the tempo
Many have died trying to stop my show

I'm as bad bad, as Leroy Brown Brown
Yo I'm a pro pro, but not a noun noun
If you got beef beef, then you'll get ground ground
Cut up and sold sold, by the pound pound
I'm going downtown like Julie Brown, I'm the round mound
Not of rebound, but like a hound, I get down down
Never wore a leash but I get loose
Producin somethin fresher than fruits, got more soul than combat boots
Diggin two scoops of raisins for the troops out of some blazers
So amazin like Luther everyday Joe but not Bazooka
I used to be a hooper but now I troop to shoot a free flow
Me go with mi amigo, to see the Man named Chico
The legal alienaeno, I roll the instrumentals
Like Jack I be like Nimble never gentle to a bimbo
Not your sex symbol so save that soft stuff for the Care Bears
The way I freak funk OHHHH the Monkees sayin, ""Hell yeah""
Correction, ""Hell yes""; old folks wanna cuss
On how I walk talk and dress, they say my life's a mess
But I'm straight, are you straight, if you straight, then I'm straight
Rock me tonight, just for old time's sake

Back to our regularly scheduled program, program
I am so damn flam, I slam a slam, BAM, I slam
Like Conan the Barbarian, if you talk loud, I'll play librarian
Cause see I want it quiet in here...
I Mark a Marky and a bunch of funky Uncle Thomases
Play like Christopher Williams cause I gotta keep my promises
To stick to my roots and not dilute cause G this ain't two colors
I'm tired of seein these non rappin dancin motherfuckers

For a record sale a nigga'll sell his soul to go gold
And reach a large scale, sellin for the pale male
And I can't tell, why for a ho you grow a tail
And stop drinkin ale, the booty probably smell
Ain't no pussy worth a sale at least not for the kid to do a bid
Shit you musta flipped you lid, you was wit you slipped you slid
Got doodoo skids on my paper cause I got rhymes up the ass
If I pass gas, ducks fast or gets trimmed like a mustache
I must ask what's goin on with rap, white kids actin black
It's like McDonald's sellin fatback
Get back to your Mac, that stuff is wack with all these dancetracks
I'm hearin rap from Antrhax, my time the Caravan cracks
You're wack, that's the only thing that's black Scooter
When we was on the streets, you was at home on your computer
I'mma shoot a diss well like a fist to all these wack groups
Rhymes are wack as hell! And they sample wack loops
I'm wonderin how the hell they get a deal I still can't see that far
I feel like Cypress Hill, I could just kill an A&R
Or whoever's in Charge, it surely ain't Charles
But you ain't G-in hip-hop, cause it's ours

It's sick you sick I'm sicker, I flick a flea flicker
Think of that boa constrictor but the venom I inflicta
Is stricter, I stick I stick the stinkin to a stunk
If soda was a forty dog, then I would be like drunk
If if was a fifth I would lift the fifth and a spliff
It's not a myth about our dick width, I'm swift and I shoot the presents
In essence count your blessings I got a Wessun if you riff
I'm a nigga with SOULLLLLLLLLL, my last name should be Smith-sonian
I'm gassin girls heads, just like petroleum
Get em ready to bone me and, then I play custodian
And turn off the lights this is the likes of a
Ticketing wallowing high jumping radio rumping brother
Got Seoul like Korea gimme an inch I'll take a liter
A chick is a chick that's how I treat her
Never go pop I'm not a two liter
A true leader, don't choose to follow, choose what I swallow
Whether water or a beer bottle, of course I play the lotto
Wear em? No, share em? A ho
I like the girls the girls I share a life with a bro
Cause U-A-C is family, much tighter than foundations
That holds up the walls, so you better proceed with caution

Those of you who go out and stay
Out all night and half the next day
And expect us to be home
When you get there

But let me tell you something
The sisters are not going for that no more
Cause we realize two things;
That you aren't doing anything for us
We can do better by ourselves
So from now on we gonna use
What we got to get what we want
So you'd better think, think

It was the time when we haven't met?
That's the thing I never will forget
Now baby I got a whole lot to give
And a whole lotta loving
That a woman could give yeah

But before I give it up I gotta think think
Think what the future holds for me
Just go ahead and see
I don't need no heartache
I can't stand no misery
Let me think think

It takes two to make a thing go right
It takes two to make it outta sight
All right yeah

Don't say it's easy
Just plain living
Sometimes it's kinda tough

If it's not in your vision
Don't make no decision
Hey yeah all right

So I'm laying the cards on the table
When it comes to taking care of me
I know I'm able
You may not call it true
But I won't do nothing that you won't do
Said I won't do nothing that you won't do

So think about the good things
Come on and think about the right things
You got to think about me too

Come on and think think about you
Come on and think about the good things
Come on and think about the right things
Come on and think about me too

And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future cuz we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby

[Hook: En Vogue]
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
You gotta say it again now
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Heeh

[Verse 2: Pepa]
My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me everytime I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

[Verse 3: Spinderella]
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Tryin' to rush me good and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac (shit)
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find

[Hook: En Vogue]
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Say it again now
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Ohh, uuuh
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
I said what a mighty good man
You know what I'm sayin', he's a mighty mighty good man
Y'all hear me, now check it out

[Verse 4: Salt]
My man gives real loving that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood cuz he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker cuz that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful cuz his mama taught him that

I've got a good man

[Hook: En Vogue]
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
A mighty mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man
What a mighty good man
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man

He's a mighty mighty good man
What a mighty mighty good man

Tell me like that sugar
Now break it down
I break it down one time

What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man
What a man, what a man

(Hey...)

Y'all ready for this?

(Uh huh, it's all good)

Now this ain't the name calling game
See, I can refrain from using names to get paid
Since I'm known to creatin kinds of beats that make your rump shake
Records are great, But now let's set the record straight

(They thought you was a sellout)
I'm sellin' out tours cause sellin' cd's, I'm the one M. B
You wanna beat the G, I beat you like hizzos
In the backseat of my caddy you'll be callin' the Hammer daddy

I'll work you like a slave
Misbehavin' you were gonna
Pay tax on? My brothers soul

Hit the streets cornered?
And I refuse to forget that alright you talked tough
But face to face was a just a trick, bro

They put me in the mix, Too legit to quit
I came wit' a long list of it
And in the future you'll find me on the billboard
Or on the floor of the sign receiving music awards
And it's all good

(Hey...)
(It's all good)

Y'all ready for this?

(Uh huh, it's all...)
(Hey...)
(It's all good)

Y'all ready for this?

(Uh huh)

It's all good!
The talk you been talkin'
To talk that talk
You gotta walk that walk

Or the Hammer man's stalkin', So enter the dragon
And once you burned up, Those? Caught in dissin my bandwagon

Suckers, read billboard and weep
You in the hot seat where I'm from talk is cheap
And when I see ya, The styles you wrote man
A mean left hook took ya out, And it came from Oakland

Check it, You punks don't know me
A true O. G. Yo, I was runnin"" the whole scene
You started talking all that mess But I'm callin"" your bluff trick
I thought you new And boy you still can't touch, this

It's better than the average, bro
I'm not the average Joe, With the average flow
Yo I can still do things That you wish you could
You're talkin' all that lip, But I don't even trip
Cause it's all good

Chorus

I'm fed up, So now I gotta set 'em up
Knock em till I never, never ever let 'em up
But like a trick he might kick I'll be prepared to red 'em up
However, if you wanna slang em, Then we can get 'em up
Black sheep you're weak you're meek You're tryin' to grow feet
Dres I make ya look head But first, I'm a get your teeth
Talkin' about my mama's where I draw the line Redman
Dancin' with the corners of yo dome I'm a blow your mind, So!

Since I'm not the one who could be I'll
I feel the need say 'you wanna be' you gotta be real
Cause if ya ever come my way like I used to say
Homeboy you better pray just to make it today

I know what it is
The ratta tat piece of corny rhymes you keep sayin we don't find worth playin
I don't feel like I'm a gangsta so you claim that I'm a sellout
When we meet up on the street, then we'll see who bail out
And it's all good

Half Ounce in the mutherfuckin house

It all starts in them muthafuckin streets
With the shooting up, bang bang
From the quiet neighbourhoods to them loc'd out Compton gangs
From they mommas to they daddies to they grands
Passed generations with rags in they fuckin' hands
And living in Compton you can't deal with the hassle
Uh, living in Compton one time's tryin' to gaffle
Uh, living in Compton boy you better think fast
Niggas ain't fuckin around, they'll put a slug in your ass
Never givin a fuck goin' out like geez
Slangin them keys, jackin naked body on D's
Do or die is the motto that we strive to live
Do a muthafuckin drive-by on your wife and kids
From every hood to block to park to street
You cross the wrong fuckin' line and your ass gets beat
One for all, all for one is how we go down
Niggas make the muthafuckin hood go round

That's righ, geah
Niggas make the hood... geah... go
You know...

The hood done took under all kinds, yeah I know
From my homies down in Watts to the G's in Chicago

What's up? And everybody's up on the gank
It don't matter how the fuckin blood splatter, long as get yo' bank
Real G's come in all shapes and sizes
Dottin' your eyeses, packin all kinda surprises
The type of niggas that don't give a fuck about one time
Fill they fuckin' car full of holes with this brand new 9 (pop pop)
And now your shit outta luck
Niggas ain't fuckin around when they hood starts throwing down (geah)
Caps get peeled with this hot ass A.K
Ain't no stoppin' cause we poppin' punks on rainy days
A place where there's about a million night stalkers
Gangsta walkers, muthafuckin' shit talkers
Throw your straps in the air when you hear the sound (yeah)
Niggas make the muthafuckin' hood go round

Geah
Niggas make the hood... go
You know

Damn the hood is kinda hot (say why)
Just heard one of the fuckin homies got shot (shit)
And we don't need it cause it's some shit that we just went through
At Martin Luther King guess who we ran into
The enemy, no friend of me, homies grab your straps (what's up?)
In the waiting room it's time to peel some fuckin caps
And ain't no losin cause we already lost
The homie from the hood so they asses get tossed
And ain't no cowards from my camp, so homie let's dump
Fill they ass full of holes right after we stomp
That's the way it happens, the way I'm sayin'
Fool, niggas from the old school ain't playin (geah)
You got beef? Muthafucka that's cool (you got beef?)
Say hello to the mutherfuckin tool (what's up man?)

Approach to the course and the force is centrifugal
Can you find ya way through the lyrics that be catching em
Throw another rhyme across the room they be fetching em
And they take a loss, take a loss to the Master and I
Throws crazy blows and they knows I be plastering
All across the room on the ceilings and the walls too
Punk little suckers didn't know I had the gall to
Come around they block with my cocked-diesel system and
Turn it up to 10 and then start to diss them and
They didn't wanna battle if they did when they saw me
They'd a opened up they trunk but they try to ignore me
Hey little suckers I know you hear me callin you
Thought you wanted some but I see that you all into
Frontin ain't no future in your frontin so let's get it on
Like Marvin Gaye,(hey) take the cash and sit it on
The hood of ya wick-wack low-ridin Cadillac
Back up ya boys and let's start the battle
Act like, ya know, the Masta Ace don't play when it come to my bass, aahhhh

Check it out baby, check it out y'all
I was born to roll (repeat several)

[Verse 2]
Drivin down the block like what else should a brother do
It's Saturday, it's Saturday, the heat might smother you
Rolling down my windows yeah I have a air-conditioner
But I got the sound I want the whole world to listen to
Waitin at a red light, Kentucky Fried Chicken in
Low End Theory tape in, bass crazy kicking in
See this Puerto Rican Latin Chico Rico Suave
In a red Corolla eh yo does he wanna play
Pullin up beside me, looking like he want it
Show me what you got then watch me get up on it
Holding up traffic but we can't hear they horns
Cause he music a grande yeah he got it goin on
But I think I better school him cause he don't know the time
So I'm turnin up the boom cause he cannot mess with mine
Brothers hear me hitting from like 50 blocks away I
Wanna turn they heads so you know I gotta play
High decibels passing through a residential district
See a few cuties and I turn it up like Bisquick
Mira, mira man don't sleep, I got tha, I got tha, I got the woofers in my Jeep

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Black boy, black boy turn that shit down
You know that America don't wanna hear the sound
Of the bass drum jungle music go back to Africa
Nigga I'll arrest you if you holding up trafffic
I'll be damned if I listen, so cops save your breath and
Write another ticket if ya have any left and
I'm breaking ear drums while I'm breaking the law
I'm disturbing all the peace cause Sister Souljah said war
So catch me if ya can, if you can here's a donut
Cause once you drive away, yo I'm gonna go nuts
And turn it up to where it was before nice try
But ya can't stop the power of the bass in ya eye
I wonder if I blasted a little Elvis Presley
Would they pull me over and attempt to arrest me
I really doubt doubt it, they probably start dancing
Jumpin on my tip and pissing in they pants and
Wiggling and jiggling and grabbing on they pelvis
But you know my name so you never hear no Elvis
Strictly the hardcore dirty street level hits
God's on my side so watch what the devil gets
Positivity hitting 50 levels deep
Coming out, they coming out the woofers in my Jeep

CMG and K and finsta make a grip
Coming straight from out the O, so you know, that
(We got the funky track that's phat)
But anyway it's my turn so let me introduce
Special One first up from the gangsta crew
Known as TCD with a title and a rep, it's quite apparent
Serving funky shit to keep you motherfuckers staring
Pump it up, mack shit for your ears
Kick it loud and clear, making hoes disappear
Hittin' donuts in a tre' sideways, to the
Next light, triple sold thangs and my shit's tight
Five deep mobbin' through in The Town
Deuce Tone, Gangsta Flake with the top down
Damn, this shit's hittin' hard in the trunk
Got me three wheel switchin' on them bitches on the next block
Headed straight to the top
And as long as my skills pay the bills I'mma never stop
Kicking that shit you love
Pass the dank and a drank for the bitch to buzz
It's a ghetto thang so I bring the ghetto slang
Hookin' niggas like the 'caine when I do my thang
Five real G's mobbin' on a mission
Check it, it's the funky expedition that we call a little something to ride to

Expedition, funky expedition

Come and catch a thrill with the super skill rhyme flowing
Daughter on attack with the knack to keep your speakers blowing
Riding with a gat in my lap and one finger on a Zap
Looking for some niggas in a Cadillac
Yeah, we on point, rollin' a point
Special One and CMG blazin' up a joint
Keepin' a steady pace in a car race
Sidin' on a strip with a grip and an eighth in my glove case
Never leavin' a trace, but leaving the 5-O's blind
'Cause I'm fucking conscious of these streets of mine
Rollin' lit with the tint shed shallow
And I'll be back around the block for niggas to jock tomorrow
From East O to the B town, looking for a freak now
With hella scratch to get at
Check it, CMG on a mission
To get with some niggas to ride on this funky expedition

All up in your trunk
Somethin' to ride to, feel that shit, yeah

Foothill Boulevard, the bumpy ass strip
Homies steady clownin' on the gas, brake, dip
It's a conscious groove, making all my daughters move
Rollin' through the town with big bass boom
Let's get bigger on these niggas up the street
Jock 'em for a minute let 'em take us out to eat
But I concentrate on all my niggas later
I flow to this shit 'cause I'm Special One the greater
But it's this funky that got me gripping still like this
Come into my show, if you fine, you may kiss
Don't mess with the bomb, I never stress no tension
Come kick it with the Daughters as we take you on a funky expedition

Daddy's home...

Heh, so??
You say that like that means somethin to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time
For you to be comin home talkin that ""daddy's home"" shit (nigga)
We been gettin along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS.. FUCK YOU!

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle
I'm so sorry...

[Hook]
I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

[Verse 2: Wycked]
Moms had to entertain many men;
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again.
I'm gettin a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother;
Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin like my father
Should I stay or run away? Tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his papa wasn't man enough;
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
Unless you got the time it's a crime; don't even bother
(That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles
Said I was an only child)
Look at mama's lonely smile!
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And ohh -I guess ya didn't know
That I would grow to be so strong
Lookin kinda pale, was it the ale or pops was wrong?
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin, Jack!
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that ""Born to be a father"" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me: all alone, G
Now that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me
You're so sorry

[Hook]

[Verse 4: 2Pac - impersonating his father]
I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was a danger;
If I wanted to to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a
Had to move on, done lost my name and picked a number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast
But livin slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the titan you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry...

[Intro]
Regulators. We regulate any stealin' of his property. We’re damn good too. But you can’t be any geek off the street. You gotta be handy with the steel, if you know what I mean. Earn your keep. Regulators, mount up!

[Warren G]
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

[Nate Dogg]
Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryin' to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

[Warren G]
So I hooks a left on 21 and Lewis
Some brothers shootin' dice, so I said, ""Let's do this""
I jumped out the ride and said, ""What's up?""
Some brothers pulled some gats, so I said, ""I'm stuck""

[Nate Dogg]
Since these girls peepin' me, I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Onto bigger, better things than some horny tricks
I see my homies and some suckers all in his mix

[Warren G]
I'm getting jacked, I'm breaking myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brother, said, ""Damn, what's next?""

[Nate Dogg]
They got my homie hemmed up and they all around
Can't none of them see him
If they goin' straight pound-for-pound
They wanna come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

[Warren G]
They got guns to my head, I think I'm going down
I can't believe it's happening in my own town
If I had wings, I would fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homie Nate

[Nate Dogg]
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

{Interlude}

[Nate Dogg]
I laid all them busters down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switchin' my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts, sit back and observe
I just left a gang of hoes over there on the curb

[Warren G]
Now, Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked I was on the same track
Back up, back up, ‘cause it's on
N-A-T-E and me, the Warren to the G

[Nate Dogg]
Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help
But Nate Dogg and the G child were in need of somethin' else
One of them dames was sexy as hell
I said, ""Ooh, I like your size""
She said, ""My car's broke down
And you seem real nice; would you let me ride?""
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

If you smoke like I smoke, then you're high, like, everyday
And if your ass is a buster, 213 will regulate

So I rest defense on my ligaments
Pistol grip pump on my lap, risking it
So life living it, never giving back
Too late for slipping, so slack... up
It's on my lap, its on your lips so track shit
A steel dick full clip for punk butts

Cause tricks be out for your blind side (side)
Never understood it, but remember I showed you that
In the nineties you gotta look over your shoulder strap
Well that ain't nothing but just for getting high
And a cop ain't give a shit for just passing you by

If you ain't got none, bitch, I got- I got a million styles

Show me have a enough steam, to blow me up, run up, what up, shut up

Until you're outtie, at the cemetery

{word, give it up} aight, yeah

Rinking twinking body shaking
'Nough attacking brain's a-racking
Clock tocking Chuck shocking
Flavor Flav ain't never shaving

(One, two, three. four, hit it)

[Verse 1: Chuck D (& Flava Flav)]
It's another record, check it, mad methods
To put my brothers and sisters on a deathbed
You know he cheated, took what he wanted but now you blunted
Suckin' up to the devil, steppin' down a level
It's who they fear is you
Who protects us from us and you from you
Yes and it counts, (fuck the 40 ounce)
I sued them bastards, yeah they got bounced
I did 'em like a demo (threw 'em out the window)
I took a 98 cause I never liked a limo
But pump pump pump pu-pump pump it up
A mad rhyme, for mad times, that's what's up
Some ain't gonna change, I got em in a range
I gotta rearrange, so I'm buildin' back your brain
Wreckin' records with funky stuff
Am I loud enough? (Yeah) You got to give it up

[Hook x4: Flavor Flav]
Give it up, give it up, give it up yo
Give it up, give it up, gotta give it up

[Verse 2: Chuck D (& Flava Flav)]
Come again with the same old bounce
I'm calling a foul and once again it counts
Mad tense mad tense brothers know
The blunts in the back got the black behind and that's whack
(And once again it's on!)
Hey Jimmy cracked corn cracker singin ""I don't care"", it's on
I'm coming with a rhyme (what?), I'm lettin go a rhyme (yeah!)
I gotta get a rhyme through the rough and crazy times
Call me a Hannibal lecture, yes I checked her
They don't hear me though, so here I go
I'm sick and tired so Sly'll take ya higher
When I'm taking his sound to bring you down
Rappers ripping a lyrical kicking finger-licking
But to the rhythm I'm giving but never cotton picking
Like James Brown, I'm saying it loud
Am I loud enough? You got to give it up

[Pre-Hook x2: Flava Flav]
Some ain't gonna change, some ain't gonna change
Some ain't gonna never ever change

[Hook]

[Interlude: Chuck D, Flavor Flav]
And when I'm coming, some young dumb and fulla cum
Some second guessing my lessons about saving young
Some don't know, like Run said ""so here we go""
Where it is inside, whoop there it is
There it is
There it is, damn right
My man X is a bad mother (shut your mouth)
I'm talking about Terminator, he's the man
There it is, can you hit me off with another one

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chuck D]
I never did represent doing dumb shit
Some gangsta lying - I'd rather diss Presidents
Dead or alive, bring 'em and I'll swing 'em
I vocalize, I just rap, I don't sing em
Flick em, and I fling em, you can go with em
Hall of Fame for the game for the points I Dave Bing 'em
Go Grandmama, close but no cigar
I got mine, for I'm using my rhyme
The flow go wherever I want, and that's clever
Give a piece of my time, to prevent some crime
And who behind putting the guns to the young ones
The ones that make 'em is the ones that take 'em
Rugged for no reason, down in duck season
I don't want my mama, on the street wearing armor
So check yourself before ya wreck yourself
Respect yourself, ha, you gotta give it up

And you can ring my bell if you need me to pass
The dutchie on the left hand side for the sale
Cuz nobody knows where the nose goes when the doors close
Dog chow got the hoes
Lookin' for the theme from the Black Hole

Verse One: Al Skratch

Yeah, it's Al Skratch, that real smooth brother
The undercover lover makin moves on your mother
If I have to, it's only natural, that I rap to
Any girl walkin through my hood if she's lookin good
And if she's somethin fine, I'll be humpin hind
Let's get it on, ain't nuthin wrong, with a little Bump N Grind
(Bump N Grind) Now that's what my man say
Sometimes I lay in my bed, and I dream of bein hand-fed
I made the jam, with my man, about the _Homiez_
But now I must remember all about my tenderonis
You're lonely by your homey baby I know how you're feelin
You in the mood for some Sexual Healing (sexual healing!)
Walk in to the jump I spot you as the music's blarin
Starin, but not - carin, about, what you - wearin
You're full grown with a mind of your own
I make you moan as my bone turn brick like stone
Whether you're single we can mingle as you jingle
Swing low, with the black Mandingo
I be the dough money-maker rump-shaker
To the bedroom I said ""hmm I'll take her""

[BM] If you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
[BM] Said if you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
Don't waste her time, don't waste no time
[BM] Said if you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
[BM] Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
I'll take her, I'll take her

Verse Two: Big Ill

Yeah, well it's Big Ill, silly me, I puff the Phillie G
I make your body move, get smooth like Billy Dee
Get you hopin, make you beg for the third leg twice
Cause I _Make it Funky_ like my name was Greg Nice
Hit you off, then I'm ghost somethin proper-like
Two things I never do: fall in love or drop a mic
I'm Big Ill, now you know my style I'm glad you came
I give your man a pound, then I ask you what's your name
(What's your name baby?) Sign a autograph, then I step w/ my staff
To the hotel, hope everything goes swell
That's what you say as I sway on my way to my room
Crazy deep, don't sleep I keep the poom poom.. jockin
Clockin, knockin out the box when, I perform
That's why the girlies they swarm to see Big Ill
Later on that night at the arena
I seen her, tryin to get backstage between the
Niggas I was wit and the security, she didn't
Lookin from a distance I see her booty's hittin (oh yes babe)
Stagger to the barricade and bag her as I grab her
Thinkin to myself, ""Aiyyo, I got to have her""

[BM] If you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
[BM] If you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
I'll take her, I'll take her, I'll take her
[BM] Said if you don't want her don't waste her time {*1}
On my knees, ohh yeah
[BM] Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
Hahhh-ohhhh-ohhh-ohh-oh-hohh-yeah, I'll take her (I'll take her)
[BM] If you don't want her don't waste her time
Bring it here to me, yeahhh!
[BM] Said if you don't want her don't waste her time
Ooohhhhhh, I'll take her

Verse Three: Big Ill, Al Skratch

Yeah.. yeah.. I like your flow yo, do I say oh no?
And get it hittin one on one like a solo
I think not, cause it ain't no fun
If my homey Mr. Raspy Skratch can't get none

Hey! I be the one with the voice that's raspy
Al Skratch see, gettin downright nasty
I pass the, girls in my vicinity
Back to my man Big Ill, he got the remedy

For the..

Oooh baby oh baby

[Verse 1]
I need a girl who ain't scared to scrap
Someone who got my back
Gotta be a dark skin or light skin black
The type of girl that stays busy all day
But when the sun goes down, she's my sexy souffle (Hey)
Somebody real who ain't afraid to work
If you try to disrespect ya mess around and get ya feelings hurt
She ain't pressed from your ? ? ? ?
She'll only flex with a brother that can handle it
And I don't care if she's a little bit jealous
She can still be a lady while she's coolin' with the fellas
An intellectual, beautiful, sexual
Hands on her hip but when she flips she's incredible
Candlelight dinners from her man
But she's a trooper if she has to she'll eat beans from the can
A very nice girl but don't mistake her for no softy
And that's the way I like it
Yeah, my black coffee

Black coffee gotta fit like a mitten
Roars like a lion when I stroke her kitten
Versatile, wears the Colgate smile
She got the piles of style, ain't had none in a while
Party animal, but dig it, only when she's with me
And I don't have to worry 'cause she won't disrespect me
She's everything that a man dreams about
And when I'm with my crew, she's all I talk about (hey)
Fancy hair, jewels all flushed
Backside bigger than (her mom?) but don't touch her
Pretty skirt, you know the ones with the slit
A closet full of gear so you know she stay dipped
Body all smooth from using plenty lotion
Perfume smelling like some ol' sex potion
A nice girl but don't mistake her for no softy
And that's the way I want her

Still fuckin' with the man and it's kinda odd
That a nigga roll down and let the shit to go
Still gotta pray for the L.A., we play
Black folks still bring in to the true
But I still got love, so I'm comin' through

Separate the real from the fake each and everyday

One more dead Black man
You can ask K-Cloud 'cause the shit's out of hand
All I do is see the world just stand around and watch
Niggas drop like flies around the clock
But I never underestimate the fact
That America still hate Blacks, so I gotta act
Ever since I was three-fifths of a man
It was clear that somebody had to take a stand
So I strive to survive in a place
Where your worth is determined by your race, ain't that a bitch?
Nothin' funny from where I come from so I don't
Wear a smile 'cause I know they got me on file
Long as niggas gotta live in this hellhole
I'm a freak the motherfuckin' funk so the people know
And recognize that as long as young brothers stay 'sleep
We're born to die, shit

To leap a tall building
Crush the earth-a-phone

With bigger bite than the double-bang

Hey, yo, check it out, it's real late in the morning
All these other DJ's, they really got me yawning
But when Funkmaster Flex gets the radio hyped
The people of type, it's time to wipe
All the MC's that think they can rap real fresh
Now the Boogie to the Brown comes off and I pass any test
Like and SAT that inspires
All I ever wanted was my name on fliers
Blowing up the spot, rock hard, with the rhythm that goes around the clock
Tick tick tock is the hands of time
So listen to a brother as I start to climb
It's like that, that that or this
Get up and get dissed because my crew makes five fingers and a fist
That's right, reminice over cuts and give me a kiss baby doll

""Nuttin' but flavor like Funkmaster Flex"" (cut and scratched 4x)

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Shoot me down, hear the sound
WOOO, tight rugged-ass hip-hip sound
Here I go again, something brand new
Like my mom-AHH, rough any son out of the blue
Straight to the point baby, I was born to be dope
I was doing me, doooing meeee, DOOOOING MEEEEE, nope
You slept on the record now it's time to break out
Like a 40 being cracked, tasting good down the neck
The lyric that I'm kicking to you from the crib
All in together now, funky like a shoe
Baby, I love rap and rap loves me
Like a sister to a microphone to an MC
What is an MC if he has no flow?
Go aheeeeeaaaad, it's that in, Inspector Closeau
Uh, Black Panther, would you do me? No sir
Doing me is like a fisherman without water
Then what could you catch? Nothing, stop fronting
That's like a man with no legs kicking something
What could you kick if you're not that slick
Another flip to God, it's like Hot without him sir!
What is your mission, please allow me to rock the spot!
Kill a cop, don't cop walk do jop!

The Biz came here to rock you and really blow your mind
I can't really do it to you girl, I can do it to you anytime
I don't mean no harm girl, all I want to do is sing
With Funkmaster Flex on the turntables, and I am the microphone king
I am down with the F-L-I-P Squad and you know I'm the
Uh, original B-I-Z Markie, hey now
You know me as the o-rig-in-al B-I-Z dub-iz uh A-R-K I with the E
Best in Zing, man-appointed rap king
Now I am bug-ging on the mic, no it's me, do what I like
Now I'm sending this out to New Jersey and the Boogie Down
Can't forget um, um, um, the Queens and
Brooklyn is on the scene and
Uptown, Manhattan, and Connecticut, it don't matter to me
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all
Party having people guaranteed to be like having a ball
I'm the original one
It don't matter to me because you know I sound so full and
Ahhhhh, number like addition
Super-educated, I'm on top of the list and
This is something for the radio, hoe
You know me, cause I am on the go
Another mic and DAH DAH DAH DAH DAH DAH DAH DAH DAH DAH
I make that out of my mind
Now I can sing a record, I get respected
I'm never neglected, while connected, Kyle connected
You know me, I'm the original B, Funkmaster
I'm just buggin', I'll just leave

Now the whole, entire world's gotta try to come up with a quick decision
They claim we threats to society
And now they callin' on the government to try and make somebody quiet
For the bullshit they done to me

Gangsta Nip, Spice 1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me
So gangsta rap ain't done shit for that
I've even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat
So why you tryin' kick some dust up
America's been always known for blaming us niggas for they fuck-ups

And we were always considered evil
Now they tryin' to bust our only code of communicating with our people
Let's peep the game from a different angle
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled

So why you criticize me for the shit that you see on your TV?
That rates worse than PG
Just bring your ass to where they got me
So you can feel the hand of the dead body

Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long

Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long

So now they tryin' separation
And sendin' black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation
Tappin' into our conversation
Saying, the message that they give bring forth or premeditation

So David's got a silver mag while listenin' to Brad
David gets mad and kills his dad
David Duke's got a shotgun
So why you get upset 'cause I got one?

A tisket, a tasket, a nigga got his ass kicked
Shot in the face by a cop, close casket
An open and shut situation
Cop gets got, they wanna blame it on my occupation

If you don't dig me then, nigga, you can sue me
Because the shit that I be sayin' ain't worse than no western money
Don't blame me, blame your man, Gotti
So you can feel the hand of the dead body

Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long

You best to free your mind
Before I free my nine
And stop fuckin' with the void in pop
Or feel my hot rocks

Bang, bang, boom, boom, ping, ping, I'm the black
White boys gat a magazine and don't know how to act
I'll attack and make you vomit
Down with Khalid Abdul Muhammad

Do he got a brother, I'm it now
I'm the illest
Wanna kill this house, nigga, Don Cornelius
Can you feel this?

You punk niggas make me sick
Suckin' on the devil's dick
Scared of revolution
Need to start deuchin'

Houston is the place, I caught a case
Them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face
But I bust two times to the gut
To the Reverend, Calvin Butts, gotta pair of nuts?

I started this gangsta shit in '86
Now you dissin' me for publicity
Isn't he a hoe to the third degree?
Who me?

So fuck, Bill and Hillary

Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said ""You got me waiting""
Sitting in my car, waiting for you-ooh-ooh, lalalala

[Verse 1]
I got a girl, but I'm about to switch all that
Because my girl be trying to play me like the bitch all that
Shoot, clocked her daughter, for acting out of order
To impress a girl who to me knocked her out the water!
But because the kid swears love
Though when I see her friend its like the shit wears off
I don't bother, while she want to kiss and then cuss and full of hate
Get her friend? Mission Impossible
Because she's the one the hon chose to boast to
The way that her and the bitch is so close to be a waste
So make music in my basement
Don't cut her off till I find a good replacement
One day I jumped in my Jeep, drove her to her friend's
House, cause the hon was sleeping over
My girl was acting fine, then the slime switched
Wanna diss, I said ""It's over, you waste of time bitch""
Tried to kiss her friend, twice then a third
She said ""Stop, Rick"", but didn't tell her friend a word
I went to bed, here come my girl touching me intently
Snuck out later, girlfriend wasn't acting as friendly as before
Because she swore a nigga hit her
""Well if you ain't love her why'd you go back to bed with her?""
But I didn't, now the hon badgering
I don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm imagining the love affair

[Bridge]
Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you ho

[Verse 2]
Another brother out for one thing, mistook him for
Steady relationship is what I'm really looking for
Sincerity, scoop the hon I done it
I said ""Being straight up, it's you I really wanted""
Though she fucked niggas with money like mad
I still found myself wanting the honey quite bad
Loyal to her friend, though she wanted wood
Then we did it, boy that pussy was good
""But what if shorty finds out?"" Never be too clever
""Rick, she has to know if we're to ever be together""
Chill, then we started to button the strap and
Then my girl woke up, we acted like ain't nothing happened
Later on, my girlfriend stormed in
""We going to the supper club, some kid's performing
Bye, see you later""
Her girlfriend hot, let me see how they livin', Rick decide to follow
I'm outside of the club sipping a beer through the best can
Both sluts were sliding numbers to the next man
Contradicting of words being together
My girl, too, I should've known, birds of a feather
Back in my Jeep, about 4:11
Popped another can, looked up to the heavens
I'm a good man, in fact I know that I am
And I deserve a lady love, that's why I'm wondering why I'm

Sitting in my car, waiting for you-ooh-ooh, lalalala

Lady: Ragtop records, may I help you?
Fly: Can I speak to Fo?
Lady: One moment please, he's around
4-Tay: Yo, wassup?
Fly: Wassup, Fo? I know you finished that cut for the radio
4-Tay: As a matter of fact Fly I just finished it baby boy, no worry about nothin', I'll be around

[4-Tay]
Regardless if I'm chillin' backstage or on tour
With my homie Young Fly even Al B. Sure
Never hesitate to call me after I'm done
Cause homie I'm real and always true to my loved ones
Too many wakes and funerals full of tears
You say there's something on your mind, well hey, I'm all ears
Cause ain't nobody thinking about the funk that you're choosin' it
A lot of my homies stuck in the pen for life or losin' it
Call up your folks you keep thinkin' about home
Recorder keeps a peep and there's a block on the phone
And all of this is enough to make a brother's nerves bad
Reminds me of a situation that I once had
Spent that, spent this endless relentless tremendous women on my jock
And don't nobody mind their business
He say she say throwin' salt about it
And chooses to talk about you cause there's no one else to talk about
Talk about the show and the flow and all the clout
Then be real with yourself and talk about and turned it out
It's not hard to compete when his name is poppin'
A scared man can never win that's why I stay clockin'
Fools be huffin' and puffin' don't wanna see me about nothin' I'm down
And if you ever need me Fly: I'll be around

[Hook]
Whenever you call me: I'll be there
Whenever you want me: I'll be there
Whenever you need me: I'll be there
I'll be around

Life ain't based on peaches and cream
This new generation lost a whole lot of dreams
Future doctors, producers, and mothers
The list goes on but now we killin' our brothers
And if we killin' our brothers that means we killin' our own kind
These kids is watchin' now it goes to their mind
Rat-tat-a-tat cause you got a gat
Then they want a gat you livin' like that?
Moms ain't cookin' she worked the week straight
If anything she's the one deserves a hot plate
The ghetto, the ghetto ain't nothin' to dream about
Tryin' to get out now that's somethin' to think about
Fools might disagree but I'm a stay sucka free
Now I'm so black and so strong they can't fade me
Blacks are blacks worst enemy there's still no remedy
You got me for a grip do you call yourself kin of me?
Jealousy, envy, I see it in your eyes
Tell me what's wrong with seeing a black man rise
I keep it funky it's pretty hard to miss it now it is not explicit
A message for the mind, and a moral for statistics
So I'm doin' what we call a roll call
Talkin' about the ones who won't rap then take a downfall
I spit the street life and then I go underground
You silly, it's called versatility and I'll be around

[Hook]

Things are gettin' crucial you gotta exercise your mind
Or learn about life before you're left behind
But how you gonna get it right when you're not doin' right
When you get mad all you want is a gunfight
This tension causes a gang of madness
Now you want funk that results to sadness
Sadness results to a lot of revenge
And your so called friends really ain't your friends
So how do you know who you're able to trust
If you think about the past look what happened to us
I never trust no one, I only trust myself
Or I would've been a victim like everyone else
In friendship or hardship whenever you need me
Just give me a call G I won't deceive thee
These fools be shakin' best believe they're fakin'
Just tryin' to get a grip of all the money you're makin'
This ain't race a mind is a terrible thing to waste
I drop the rap and J drops the bass
To the flow cause ain't nobody get with Fo
I'm a down young brother comin' straight outta Frisco
Droppin' a message out of love to your town
Love your brothers and sisters and I'll be around

Get more Biz than Markie as I spark thee

Ooooh here comes the roar, knock on your door
I wonder who it is and who could it be
Ain't nobody but the I.N.C
Wit mo' Soul than the Train I'm a reign
With 808 beats that hit big like Kane
Daddy, caddy, Coup DeVille, chill
Jump in my ride and slide down the hill

And tryin to impress, never the less, yo

Cause we cruise in the I.N.C. Ride

Ain't nobody but the A (o-kay)
And I'm not the one you wanna play (don't play)
I'm flat like a cap on a can of flat black
Let me snap back break a nigee down with my rap
Cause this is how we do
Who is the crew coming through with the brand new
As we flex and get fly, you cry
The roof is on fire but my name ain't Left Eye
Punks be all up on it like a Charlotte Hornet
But they full of Chicago Bull-shit cuz they don't want it

[Verse 1]
I stagger in the gatherin' possessed by a patter-in
That be scatterin'
Over the global, my vocals be travelin', unravelin' my abdomen
It's slime that's babblin' grammatics that are masculine
I grab the men, verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madeline was back on video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believin' everything I'm readin'
But my brain was bleedin', needin' feedin', and exercise
I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine
Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense, cause I was guilty in a sense

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like I spend nights up in dykes
In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
I got it made
I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the malt liquor
Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas, now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruising Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't, now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga
But it's my turn to go I gotta go
And I'm gone with the storm

[Verse 1: Mad Lion]
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Why does a DJ test and he end up die
I know, I know, I know, I can't explain
My copper shot just blow their brain
Who are the man with the gun inna his hand
Step up on the scene like Captain Caveman
You want the music everybody scream louder
Lick pure shot and smell the gun powder

[Verse 2: Doug E. Fresh]
On and on and on and on...
Yo, freestyle flow to make the crowd just go
The old to the new, the new to the old
{Beatbox} The rhythm be working up on me
The crowd be jumping up for me, the people are waiting up on me
To enter the stage in the rage, Mad Lion's out the cage
Now it's time for me to engage, uhh
And bear witness, the lyrical fitness
The jumps, the dives, the leaps, are you getting this?
Next to step up, microphone check up
KRS-ONE, so come and get your wreck up

[Verse 3: KRS-ONE]
Our mother who art in Heaven number seven is the weapon
With the Goddess I'm stepping lyrically I'm never begging, you know
I'm the difference between indo and oregano
Imagine how fresh I am now, I made these lyrics up a year ago
So report back it was fat, fit, all that, quick, pump that, drop the S-hit
I'm lyrically physically fit
Catch me bugging on the mic, every day and every night
Every hour, every second, man it don't stop, get it, get it
Yes, admit it when I'm way up in it
You can't hide cause my radar's going bibip bibip bibip
I reside in the watchtower watching MCs land
Your career will be as short as my part in ""Who's The Man""
Goddamn I'm the pinnacle, yes the metaphysical
Come to you as the rap god of lyrical syllables
Fall to your knees, bring fruit, ask advice
Put your rhymes on the altar, burn them as a sacrifice
The aroma reaches up to my nostril
I get hostile, your lyrics are stiff like David Koppel
Yes Premier rocks the track on time
KRS-ONE with off of the top of the head rhyme
Yeah Fat Joe, you know you got a flow
My man Doug E Fresh down with the one called KRS
We got the mad MCs up in the D&D
I'm out, G

[Verse 4: Fat Joe]
Yeah!
Motherfuckers know who's the best
If it ain't Fat Joe then it must be Lord Finesse
Think not, then show what you got
But don't grab this mic, the shit's too hot
I'm the born killer, nigga from the Bronx
Rappers talk shit but there's really no comp
Bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, so Smif-n-Wessun if you're down with me
Represent one time on the M-I-C

[Verse 5: Smif-n-Wessun]
Mr. Ripper, get your gear and prepare for war
Mr. Vickster, you ain't gotta tell me no more
Cause what I see, on the daily
Deals with reality, so come follow we on this journey
Through Brooklyn where the crooks dwell in the projects overlooking
In the form of the streets, you know them well
Bet your ass this grass is greener
Than a 20 sack of sensimila brought straight from Medina
You know the vibe when Smif-n-Wessun twist up the Thai
Peace to my people in the Ville, peace to my heads in the Stuy
We do or die, we test your stamina
So any challenger we pass the motherfucker off to the Damaja

[Verse 6: Jeru the Damaja]
Super scientifical madness
My status is the baddest every time I bless the apparatus
You wish to take me out, so you study
Meanwhile my clothes, mics and foes are left bloody
Cruddy, filthy from the ground on up
When I plan my attack I doubt that you're ready
Rain on competition like razor sharp confetti
Kung Fu techniques from the perverted monastery
Sifu Ru manipulates the microphone
And rhymes like bullets penetrate your zone
See we bring more drama than Kevin Costner
No I'm not Jamaican but yes I'm a Rasta

Original rude bwoy... on your scene
Haha, ha ha ha!
Everybody light your blunts, get your smoke on
Hahah
All you bitches drop your drawers... witcha stinkin ass (stinkin ass)
Just roll that weed (roll that weed) just roll that weed (roll that weed)

[Verse One]
Aiyyo, yes it's me the MC Grand Royal
Spittin that Newcleus I suggest you Jams On It
I'm not a role model I cracks the Beck's bottle
Smoke blunts, play pretty MC's as sex models
So inhale exhale what you smell?
Derail the frail blind MC off my trail
If he use braille, see I never been touched
Regulate the street tactics then parlay in the cut
Uhhahhh, lay back and hit this while I shit this
Flip this, get some ass flow at long distance
And plus I pack nine inches in my britches
And keep an instant lit for the funky ass bitches
Newark, New Jersey's on the map, ?comprende?
And confrontations start from the blunts and the Reme
And if an-y, MC out there wanna test
Call my boy Poppa C to put a slug in your vest

Chorus (from ""Tonight's Da Night"")

Check, I walk around the street with the black tec nine
By the waistline, kickin the hype shit
So turn the volume up a notch
And watch the ba-bump, ba-bump, make your speakers pop
(repeat 2X)

[Verse Two]
Owwww, shit I'm just one hip nigga
Shit is off the hook when my crew is in the mixture
What I deliver, over tracks and rivers
Is making your lungs collapse and quiver, it's the
PPP foundation in your ass
We be the bomb like that Oklahoma blast
Then outlast, a few clowns, sounds
Raps, stay bein the mack like Dru Down
Ask me what I smoke and I say, ""It's the method!""
Funk off the hook I leave shit disconnected!
What's the name of that town rollin up trees?
Jersey smokin up the bom ba zee!
It don't stop, you better move slowly
I make that chest wet and cosy
Then dip lowkey like OG's
Then inject that antidote to make you OD
You know a better flower get the dough G and show me
I bet you I make em more pussy than Josie *meow*
And show em How High I am just from the nosebleed (How High)
I keep it Naughty By Nature
Kick that rugged shit that Maybelline couldn't make-up, lace up

[Interlude]
(Yeah Funk Doctor, represent one time for all the blunt smokers)
Smokin weed
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, it's how we do)
Let me hear you go ooooohhhh! (ooooohhhh!)
Smoke lalala (smoke lalala)
Let me hear you go ooooohhhh! (oooohhhhh!)
Smoke lalala (smoke lalala)

[Verse Three]
Funk Doctor, got your ass locked down proper
Let me next blast derelicts, binaca
I'mma Star at War, smoke blunts, don't Chew-bacca
The head banger boogie for the marijuana shoppers
Lace the tracks with stacks of artifacts
Make the police arrest me for givin the cardiac
Cause I'm the shitter, headbanger non-quitter
Twenty blunt a day nigga, Landcruise whipper
I represent, commence to beat an instrument
Who's next to get that ass bent ten percent
I make you boo pass off your jewels you lose cause
(I am so cool... cool... cool...)
React opponent, I Got Five On It
Met some hoochie, now I got fifty-five on it
With two Coronas, I dominate my opponents
To the hardcore niggas, keep on! (motherfucker)

You a new asshole, as beautiful as gold
Look at your reflection in my shine, find
Pissy hallways are always on my mind

Somebody caught me slippin, dipped with my ride

[Spoken Dialogue]
When I was little, my father was famous
He was the greatest samurai in the empire
And he was the Shogun's decapitator
He cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty-one lords
It was a bad time for the empire
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out
People said his brain was infected by devils
My father would come home, he would forget about the killings
He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him
Maybe that was the problem
Then, one night, the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house
They were supposed to kill my father but they didn't
That was the night everything changed...

[Intro: RZA]
See, sometimes
You gotta flash em back
See niggas don't know where this shit started
Y'all know where it came from
I'm saying we gonna take y'all back to the source
Do the knowledge... yo!

[Hook: RZA, GZA]
When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before he rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo RZA flip the track with the what to cut...

[Verse 1: GZA]
Fake niggas get flipped
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was your op to shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirt
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my Clan in the front want it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: GZA]
I'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible
But when I swing my swords they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
Cause niggas styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law, I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time check it
But the pens I be sticking with, you can't state the crime
Came through with the Wu, slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells, I rock these bells
Now come aboard, it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

Song: East Side Rendezvous

[Verse 1 - Frost]
I just woke up -- thank God it's Friday
Fire up the lac and hit the highway
Pulled in the carwash, so we can hit them whitewall tires
Sedan DeVille sitting on L.A. Wires
And it's gotta be 80 degrees --
I got a check in my pocket for 15 G's
Hit the First Interstate - now I'm straight
Stop at the record store to pick me up an old school tape
Back in my ride, see the spin of the tires
Kid Frost rolling, bumpin' Earth, Wind, & Fire
It feels good holding 15 grand
So I parked the Sedan and I strolled into Greenspans
Give me a pair of your 50-30s
Cascades, cortes and a jet-black hoodie
Headed back home and got G'd-up, fool
It's an eastside rendezvous, yeah yeah

[Hook - Diane Gordon]

Come on and roll with me
On that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me
Like them OG's do

Come on and roll with me
On that late night rendezvous
Come on and roll with me
Like them gangstas do

[Verse 2 - O.G. Enius]

Now, who be that brand new daddy of the year?
I swear...baby, we goin' take you there
It's me, that eastside G y'all never heard of…
We're A.L.T. and them folks getting much love
Through the neighborhoods, through the city...
Woofers in the back bumping 'do-wah-ditty', yeah
Drop a line to them hookers for their info
Pack them smokes -- LA cappin' with their khacks low
Cause we some true players -- bandits
Got them hinas at the hotel and they can't stand it
I got that sexual healing on 'em
36-double-deuce-36, and I'm feeling on 'em
Ooh-eee, I see
She got it goin' on like a true Miss G
But I'mma stay true
P-I-M-P from the eastside

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - A.L.T.]

Now it's Friday night and everything's alright
So just sit back, relax and enjoy the flight
It's A.L.T. hitting corners in the 63
And I'm straight rendezvous-in' through the SGV
As the 18's blast pop the tape in the dash
Bumping old school fools like Teddy Pendergrass
I can feel the heat coming out from underneath my seat
I never heard the word 'defeat'
It's the middle of July, so it's hot --
I think of Kid Frost he's recording at the G Spot, fool
Frost said, ""I hope the one time don't stop ya""
I don't give a damn, I'm sipping Malibu and Vodka
I'm on that San Bernardino
In the fast lane cause baby got some hinas out in Chino
And you know that I'm a G'd up fool
It's an eastside rendezvous...and I'm there

Whisper to a bitch, 'Baby I been watchin' you'
But when I'm pervin', everything be lookin' cute

Kill em all (4X)
Don't kick up in the dirt when I'm puttin in work
Kill em all (4X)
Cause everybody dyin on this motherfuckin album

[Verse 1: Spice 1]
I murda like this (this) I murda like that (that)
Pull an AK-47 up out my motherfuckin gangsta hat
Professional Columbian Necktie, barbwire
Strangler, over killa, dead fuckin body hanga
Peepin out the window with an A.K., pullin up on these copper
Helicoptas, squad cars, swat teams with choppers
They tellin me, ""Nigga, get the fuck out before ya die
If you surrender, we'll make sure that you quickly fry""
Should I kick open the door and go to war
Or should I slit my throat
Leave a pipe bomb and a fuck you note
Hallucinations of seein lynched bodies burnin
And all the po-po had faces like Mark Fuhrman
Tear gas through my glass window pane
They wanna put me back up in the nut house again
But I'm not goin back and take my prozac
They can keep the straight jacket
And leave a straight motherfuckin jack
A straight motherfuckin jack
A straight motherfuckin jack

[Chorus: Spice 1]
(Get the hell off my dick, I'm 1990-sick)
(1990-sick) *repeat 4X*

[Verse 2: Spice 1]
Nigga's to pull the lynch, yayo case and stick
Marcia Clark screamin out murda, jumpin on OJ's dick
Motherfuckers still sufferin and healin
Some high tech knowledga white boys blew up the fuckin fed buildin
Crazy niggas still bangin and slangin crack
To the death, when the game put em up on they back
Motherfuckers catchin AIDS, from shootin hop
And phony niggas still get sprayed up on the block
And I ain't changed much, hell
I'm still smokin four or five motherfuckin choppers before it's twelve
Motherfuckers think they know me, but they don't know
I'm sellin first class tickets to the murda show
Don't wanna rap about no nigga, let's get it on
Bustin domes, buck shots through your rib bone
So all you niggas up in the magazines talkin shit
Get off my dick, I'm 1990-sick

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
1990-sick, I grasp my dick
The lunatic quick to grab my tech
Put slugs up in your neck
Compton is the city where I come from
Desert Eagle packin dum ditty ditty dum
I won't just smoke you
I be terrifyin horrifyin gyeah I'mma choke you
The killa niggas on hop
We tear up your spot, Eiht, Spice, and my fuckin nigga Pac
Don't cross my path, no class
I be like shit in your motherfuckin ass
Bullets I spit at you, your hood I slid through
Evil niggas tryin to get rid of you
No witnesses so don't ask no questions
Flee the scene, one-time'll be arrestin
Killa niggas don't play that
It's Compton on no like your dome we stompin
But in that gang affiliation
Shit goes pop, we won't stop
Uhhh, in 1990-sick

Chorus: repeat 2X

[Intro]
I had a bad dream
Don't be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams
What a time you chose to be born in

[Hook: Life]
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

[Verse 1: GZA]
It was the night before New Year's, and all through the fucking projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a Tec
Outsiders were stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there
You know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight, fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fucking lights
Gunshots, shatter first-floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Construction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hanging from his farmer's
And it's bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas laying on roof tops
For his cream he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don't suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae, increase the murder rate
Similar to hit men who pull out Tecs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashing checks again
Back to the motherfucking spot on Lexington

[Hook: Life]
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world (x2)

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Yo - no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Cliques control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o'clock midnight
Stick-up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scrambling for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learning fast
357's and 44's
Bought inside corner stores, their fire sparks the wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
Cause niggas' main concern is CREAM
Some niggas in the jet black Gallant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed the kid
And hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head, and then fled
Tactical narcotic task force, back off fast
Cause the crime boss is passing off cash
Extortions for portions of streets, causes beef
Having followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script; I'm not an actor but the author
Of a modern-day opera, where the main character
Is presidential papers, the dominant factor

They send real niggas to the pen and score
Wars caused by yall
A bitch is a punk
Speakin on the ones that's the quickest to dump
Same fools ridin that'z been down for yearz
Cuz that's the shit when they around they peers
Three cheers to the turf for whatever its worth
Cuz I'mma represent till I'm set in the dirt
My mentality, battle the opponent to dip
And checkin every nigga that ever wanted to step
In my direction
Wit a question fo testin
This action I represent fo inspection
When some jump then I'm dumpin
Pumpin fear in ya ear

Free from all this nonsense, guilt, and shame

Put my gun away, cuz they got done away
By a rather pull a trigga type nigga

In the same breath, U gain less
Messin in the lex

Hit U up, and on the mic I ain't nothing nice

Sellin cabbage, smoking chronic on the curb
Hoppin at my boys about them dallaz

Ain't what the game is about

Hit the throttle and I'll be ready to swerve

[Verse 1: Dray]
I iggity am what I is
I comes to get biz so bust the jam
I might not be the man but y'all I still proceed to slam, I cram
To understand why these rappers try to faze me
They must be crazy messin with the Books and Drayzie
Big-up to Jersey and my people's out in L.I
Well-a hell-a can never cut the swell-a
Cause you can tell I gets biz like Markie
No matter what the weather son you never wanna spark me
I'm kickin rhymes and gettin mines on the regular
See me in the black Benz just blowin up the cellular
We high as shit, the sky is it
You know the sewer style yo is fly as shit
So grip (what?), you're cheap and buried cause you're never comin near it
So fear it when you hear it, cheer it but don't compare it
I still be schoolin, foolin em when I'm speakin
Kids be peepin, they love the way that we be freakin
My sewer style it cause disaster so when I ask
You better answer who's the microphone master

[Hook: Skoob] (x4)
Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker

[Verse 2: Skoob]
Well yo, here's the humdinger, I'm briggity bringin a new style of thing
It's a rap singer with a fat flow, so low and behold
I higgity hold his mic piece for ransom
It's all about expanses, stocks of skunks, props and my pops get a mansion
By the age of 16, had dreams of big screens
Mad rubbers to keep my dick clean
Chrome tools in rent
And I only go downtown to buy jewels and tints
Jaboll, Guess, ol' Gold and sess
I check the mic 2-1 and chew gum to ease the breath
My style is wild like the Cats of Villanova
The heat on the street'll keep my 40's spillin over
So the skunk and thai keep me high when I'm smokin
And I don't sleep, just take naps with one eye open
See I believe the beaded weed in me is feedin me
The inspi-ration to riggity rock the nation
From white folk to Haitian, Boriqua Jamaican
Burn MC's like degrees of Mason because you're fakin
I'm on point, exclamation with the caper
The flavor misbehaver from the super dooper rhyme maker

[Hook: Skoob] (x4)
Miggity microphone master, super rhyme maker

[Verse 3: Skoob / Dray]
I got to give a siggity shout to my mans, my fans at the shows
Friends, foes, stiggity stunts and hoes
Drats! I'm friggin to ride the fat, ooh shit!
My crew is shake, rattle and roll thick
Thicker than your blunt cause yo I be's the Brooklyn trooper
And I got more spunk than that punk from Punky Brewster
Bust the lingo Ringo stiggity Starr bingo
I run shit like Kunta, breaks bones like Mandingo
I'm starstruck like starbuck, the bad bro is mad though
I'm all that small cat like Tomko or Hasbo
I have no figgity fear yeah, it's me and mines
Masters of the microphone, makers of the super rhymes

Yo, well yo the shit sound clever, I'm clown for whatever like nuttin nice
Big-up to DJ Dice wreckin shop when he cut 'n' slice
These 20 MC's, please! I never heard of some
We need to murder some like Colin Ferguson
But now ya heard us from the under so feel the thunder
Ya best ta come clean like Jeru and Felix Unger
I'm buggin like gristle, see I suggest you
Dismiss you, my style's official and that's the issue
I show the flow I go until it's time to leave
Believe I'm packin more rhymes up my sleeve

[Verse 1: Method Man/Johnny Blaze]
I breaks it down to the bone gristle
Ill speaking scud missile heat seeking
Johnny Blazing, nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunning, my third eye seen it coming before it happen
You know about them fucking Staten kids, they smashing
Everything huh in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talking bout they blasting, hmmm
Is you busting steel or is you flashing? Hmmm
Talking out your asshole
You should have learnt about the flow and peasy afro
Ticallion stallion, chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it moving, know just what the fuck I'm doing
Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozing
Slip the cardiac arrest me, exorcist Hip Hop possess me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my STEEZ
Burning to the third degree, sneaky ass alley cat top pedigree
The head toucher, industry party bum rusher
You don’t like it? Dick up in you, fuck ya!

[Hook]
Allow me to demonstrate
That's right, you corny-ass
The skill of Shaolin, rap motherfuckers
The special technique, better go back and check
Of shadowboxing, your fucking stacks
Shadowboxing, cause your naps ain't nappy enough
And your beats ain't rugged enough, bitch

[Verse 2: GZA]
I slayed MCs back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfucking backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar trying to orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately if not soon
Set the lynching and form the execution date
As this two thousand beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA to charge niggas twenty Gs a session

[Verse 3: Method Man]
When my mind start to clicking and the strategy
Is mastered the plot thickens
This be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' FUCK
About a brother tryna size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat protect your dome
Look at Mama baby boy acting like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee, that be holding down his honeycomb, lounging son
Wu brother number one, protect your neck
Flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
Hard times and killer tactics, spitting words plus
Semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle, hit the clutch
Shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack and spitting lunghies
At a wack nigga dat, don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat, Killa Hill Projects
How to be exact, break it down
All in together now
Things are getting good looking better now
...And some other shit

Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin

[Hook x2: Johnny P]
Do you wanna ride
In the backseat of a Caddy?
Chop it up with Do or Die

[Verse 1: AK-47]
It was seven double-oh P.M
Fly low to them hoes in the B-M
Sipping Seagram, chewing on a weed stem
Touching on my fo' fif
Move it to the back so I can see who beeping this Po Pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with 3-1-2-7-6-2-10
Three-line connection
As the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the weed, we got the drinks you need
And, plus, we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
Cause I forgot where I met the ho
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes wanna snap
I straight up check the ho, really doe
To the crib

[Hook x2: Johnny P]

[Verse 2: AK-47, Belo]
Seven deuce five, I ride the point to spot the live hoes
Three miles per hour
Like we running up on some rivals
Never to deny though, these bitches look fly, 'Lo
Introduce myself
A-to-the-motherfucking-K, better recognize
Then I loose myself, juice myself
As you take one pull, uh, pass it to the left and um
Self-centered niggas'll take two pulls cause they thinking about self and um
P-I, M-P, -ology, but logically
We learning these hoes biology, and obviously, well

[Belo]
Mmm, ain't this some shit, pull up in the C-A
D-I, double-L, pumping A-C, A see hoes
They peep those, P-I, M-P, and they think that automatically
Cause he's a pimp, he gotta be full of that
M-O, N-E, but why?
Cause nigga be sporting nice cars and fancy clothes
Fresh jewels, Girbaud, flexing one five oh
Chop up that paper, ho, chop up that paper, ho
Watch where your lips go, caress my tip slow
To the tempo, instrumental
Real simple when you fucking with a pimp, doe
Get involved in the backseat
That's how it be in the Cad when you messing with them young lads
Smoking on that finest grass
Never miss what you never had, at last
P-I, M-P, -ology, but logically
We learning these hoes biology, and obviously, well

[Hook x2: Johnny P]

Verse 3: Tung Twista
Well, a motherfucker might be broke and shit
And then collecting no dough from tips
But I be spitting mo' game than a mouthful of poker chips
To get them hoes with the open lips and the provoking hips
And never gotta tell her many lies
I been looking in the city skies, get up in the kitty's thighs
Cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
Peanut butter complex and some pretty eyes
Pity cries on my strategy side, yo anatomy gotta be right
That'd be to flatter me, right
But if the head the bomb, c'mon, suck a nigga dick
Members of my clique wanna see what that'd be like
I know you wanna try that, to the rhythm of a hi-hat
Don't be bogus and deny that
I done got a ho to let my fellas run a train
While she lie back, now motherfucker can you buy that?
Where your ride at?
On the passenger side of your ho
Trying to come up on another G
The broad all up under me, trying to smother me
Looking lovely while I roll another B, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room, she rubbing me with lotion
Coming like an ocean, coasting, have her sick
Thinking me and Do or Die dig drinking love potion
The word no was never said
Twista be giving women dick in the bed, until they sick in the head
And if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't tricking the feds or spitting game, but it's chicken and bread
Kicking them legs in the air like a playa do
Then belittle in a day or two
After words I'mma slay a crew
Now that's some pimp-type shit that Belo and AK'll do
Wearing gray and blue
If a ho wanna holler, then you a playa if you hit them ends
And get the dividends
But you a pimp if you can get the same ho to wanna freak your friends
Cause I studied P-I, M-P, -ology, but logically
Be learning these hoes biology, obviously, well

Bring it back yo, bring it back
Mad Lion, KRS-One. Set, set it!

[Verse One: Mad Lion]
Act like ya know and don't act like a slob
Or else you're gonna give my gun a blow job
[?] fool and crazy
Your little Illegal style can't phase me
[?] breathing indo
Mad Lion mad and I kill people too
Whether with mic or a gun
[?] there's no place to run
No place to duck and no place turn

[KRS-One]
Lyric for lyric, KRS with god mad enthusiasm excite
The protoplasm to the orgasm
Or neck spasm
This ain't no phantasm
Title I smash 'em, your favorite rapper you can't match him
Against this
Mad Lion and Kris
Ten years ago we passed but they persist, so we ask 'em
""Who don't you think about when you think about
Taking an MC out?
It's the Teacher no doubt
Oratorically supreme
I don't go up in the mainstream, I go up in your bloodstream
Like the dope fiend
Me? You could never double team
That's the impossible dream
I don't lack self esteem I gleam
Still it seems
As I read Vibe magazine
Rappers day dream about letting off steam
You know what I mean when I roll up on the scene
And go to the extreme
On your peaches and cream team
Keep your conversations to a minimal
Mind it, I'm still Criminal Minded
If you listen you'll find it
Any time you wanna commit professional suicide
Find my tour guide
Collide where I reside
And you'll be hog tied
Crucified and drip dried
I'm amplified like the five o'clock free ride
You've been notified, we can take this outside
Statewide, along the country side I'll leave you cross eyed

[Mad Lion]
Give thanks and praise while big spliff blaze
Watch out

Keep in mind who started this flow
Mad Lion, yo you better act like you want it
Lyrics we flaunt it and float it, we own it
You copy, we wrote it
See
Clickity, click click
In goes the magazine
[?] against your spleen
Cause we don't sta-stutter
We don't sta-stammer
Gunshot [?] and now you skin like a Hummer

Is great
Whoever underrate
I keep it nice and spiffy for all you pirates
Who rape, this style I create?
Mistake
I'm real, you're fake

[KRS-One]
Yeeeeah
They were talking loud, now they mumble
The ball they fumble
My lyrics bump like razor stubble, double trouble
The Remix, I gat ya, the Funk is the Master
As I Flex on the next rapper when I'm vexed
Checks are cashed
As ass is grass fast
In a flash, long last the flavor from the Blastmaster major
Captain
Inner city general rapper
And we kept it real
No sugar, no saccharin
While other reggae artists chase the platinum, we don't fear 'em
Yesterday they were large, today you don't hear 'em
Like clothes we wear them out
Paper we tear them no doubt
Mad Lion come and take 'em out

[Mad Lion]
Double trouble
That's what you get when my blood pressure bubble
Piss in the grate, your body turn into rubble
Never want gold
You never were humble
Now it's time pitty bad bwoy them rumble
[?] a football fumble
No you wanna walk through the lion's jungle
Bring all your crew
Bust slugs and rumble
That's why the lion him say

G. Simone is down with us

And that junk in the trunk girl, makes it all good yes sir
Now picture you and me, chocolate fantasy
At the Marriott, lost in ecstasy
Got the ringer off, on the telephone
Serve you somethin' right, so that you will moan
It'll be so good, what I do to you
Makes you close your eyes, and you go ""ooh ooh""
Ask me how it feels, in your leg of lamb
Baby hot damn

(I leave 'em froze like heroin in your nose)

Never underestimate the Real Live
The gun-slinging, fat mack, a sick type of fuck, who dat?
I left blood stain in every spot that I rock
I'm representin' Jersey, spittin' rhymes like a Glock

Into the Cape Fear MC's be shell-shocked
I got the stash in my dash with the stock and the oo-wop
Who the gun abuser, who the stupid hooker user?
The pimp with the blow, countin' bank in the Land Cruiser

I get a charge from a sound of the bust
I was made to crush, I'm wettin' rappers til they rust
Plus my regiment is elite, mega deep
20 steep we creep in a five car fleet

That's how I'm bouncin' for the nine-fifth, son
We don't promote no masquerade 'cause we was players from day one
We start trends, we make hits
K-Def and Larry-O be on some Real Live Shit

(I leave 'em froze like heroin in your nose)
K-Def and Larry-O be on some Real Live Shit

Smoke-tinted windows 'cause I'm movin' with heat
I got a mean-ass broad in my shotgun seat
You can get buck any day of the week
That nigga Larry O be makin' rappers retreat

You know in life I fail, jake is on my tail
I blew up your block, I let it haze like black hail
I use a M16 to blast clowns off the planet
In cold blood, my heart is made of granite

My counterpart the K to the Def
Wicked beat-maker, mass murderer with his left
We got the whole game locked, so
Beats on hold like a pimp on a stroll

I'm bustin' caps at the sugar coated rap, yo
This is a lyrical terrorist manifesto
Sipping the Remy, gettin' lit, I'm hit
Ignite a fat spliff, I'm on some Real Live Shit

(I leave 'em froze like heroin in your nose)
K-Def and Larry-O be on some Real Live Shit

Back once more, for my niggas with the encore
One last verse to blow the spot then I bounce
Up out the scene 'cause I'm on some low shit
Tank-rollin' niggas on that ghetto pro shit

Damn, I hate to settle for less, true that
I want to live mega fat, push a Benz like a diplomat
Automatic Tecs Lazarus around my neck
Engineerin' shit with Corleone respect

The international world class don
Came to reign on hip-hop, I can't be stopped
I shoot the breeze with expertise
The mic is like a toast and when I rhyme I squeeze

The criminalogists kickin' criminalogy
The way I'm shakin' you is like a bank robbery
So yo, get on the floor and get face down
Take these slugs to your head so I can bust your fucking clown

That's what you get for playin' slick
K-Def and Larry-O be on some Real Live Shit

[Verse 1]
I don't even know how I got here
But I know that I don't ever wanna leave
I feel the aura and I feel the atmosphere
The bass is pumping and now I believe

[Pre-Chorus]
The life is my bass synth, I feel the attack now
That I have a taste there is no turning back
We are moving as one, we align with the stars
I know nothing can tear us apart

[Chorus]
There's something taking over my heart
The night is coming out of the dark
It's like there's no one else in the room
Cause baby, all I see is, all I see is you
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me (all I see)
All our senses come alive, let the music take me (all I see is you)
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me (all I see)
All our senses come alive, so happy I could die

[Verse 2]
Heartbeat racing, body losing all control
Baby, you keep my feet on the floor
You take over the rhythm, take over my soul
You be dancing, leave me asking you for more

[Pre-Chorus]
That life is my bass synth, I feel the attack now
That I have a taste there is no turning back
We are moving as one, we align with the stars
I know nothing can tear us apart

[Chorus]
There's something taking over my heart
The night is coming out of the dark
It's like there's no one else in the room
Cause baby, all I see is, all I see is you
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me (all I see)
All our senses come alive, let the music take me (all I see is you)
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me (all I see)
All our senses come alive, so happy I could die


[Bridge]
Don't tell me I don't know you
I don't know you
Remember what I told you?
Through these blind eyes?

[Chorus]
There's something taking over my heart
The night is coming out of the dark
It's like there's no one else in the room
Cause baby, all I see is, all I see is you
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me (all I see)
All our senses come alive, let the music take me (all I see is you)
Throw my hands up to the sky, let the music take me (all I see)
All our senses come alive, so happy I could die

Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
Bitch, I wanna see you shake it
Bend on over, butt-ass naked
Now pump pump pump, get it get it
I got 135 beats a minute
It's your brother, Marquis, callin' all the freaks
To show the pink and the booty-cheeks
Stick from the bottom, stick from the top
Show me a shot, lemme see what you got
Rub that ass and play with that clit
I'm still with that freaky shit
One time for the girls in Georgia
Detroit, Michigan and Miami, Florida
That's how we make our music fast
Cause the girls down South like to shake that ass!
They so fine, I can't take it
They gots to freak it, they gots to shake it

Chorus

Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
I love the way the girls be shakin'
Especially when they butt-ass naked
Bend on over, show me what you got
Cause I'm down for a table-top
So work your body, strip left side
Make me smile, get buck-wild
Cause Fresh Kid Ice got the flow
And now is the time to come get yours
Freaky shit is what I like
Especially when them bitches dykes
So shake that ass, and bitch, don't stop
Come on, girl, just make me hot
Cause I'm down for the 69
You better get yours cause I gets mine
Show what you got; bitch, stop frontin'
Drop them draws and shake a lil' somethin'!

Chorus

Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
I love to see 'em in lingerie
Tattooed titties and a Boosty-A
Stacked on the back of a cutie pie
Bend over, let me see you do the butterfly
So impressin' when undressin'
You got me stressin', bitch, stop flexin'
Keep shakin' that ass at me
Pop that coochie, freak so nasty
Double up on the table top
Hit them switches now make that ass drop
Girl, get wide open
Up and down with an in-and-out motion
Them other kings, they ain't did nothin'
You wanna get freaky?  Lemme kiss your belly button
You're so fine, I can't take it
You gots to freak it, you gots to shake it!

-This goes out to my best friend
-My partner
-The only person I can trust in this world
-This for you mom

Momma, this is one thing I still can't realize
How you been so strong when my brother died
You done kept the family together tight
Thinkin about how we gone get throght this sorrow night
This is crazy, I can't sleep nope
Even though I got revenge written across my throat
Five kids and you done lost one
Never had a daddy, but put it on your oldest son
Ain't that a b, leave me to watch the family
To make the bills get paid, you got to live scandalous G
Cause the ghetto got me pressured
Will I die sellin dope, or would I sell a million records
Ohh momma won't you feel me
Even though Ms. ?? said somebody tried to kill P
And you know your boy's sellin dope
But all you say is watch yo back
Cause you don't want to see me go

Chorus: (Repeat 2X)

Momma I don't wanna see you cry
No more tears
Cause I'm deep in the game
Sellin much cocaine

Momma how you be so strong
Even tough the ATF, done kicked down your home
And ran right through and got me
But you still came to see me
And said that you love me
And I know that you real though
Cause when I got out, you's the first one at the door
Knowing that your boy turned into a man
But you done tripped cause I still understand
That I'm trying to make some money
And if I die in this game, I guess that won't be funny
But you still on my side cause you a soldier
You the only friend I got and ma I told ya
One day I'mma change G
Even though the ghetto's crazy, think about your baby
If I make it out this dope game
I know that life won't be the same, momma I gone make a change

*snoring*
Bring in the next patient (the patient is sleeping)
Bring in his chart (the Doctor will see you now)
How you doin, let's see what we have here
My name is Dr. Killpatient
And I'm your psychosssssigmathetamasochistic

[Verse One: Rock]
All I, seem to, think about is violence
It doesn't matter if I'm dead sober or I'm bent
It's strange, I'm not insane or at least I don't think so
Or am I? You think so Doc, truthfully I don't know
So what do I do I go to my crew and ask for help
But they ain't no help, they go through the same shit they damn self
So I look deep into the mind of a crook
Then out of nowhere I envision two right hooks
Aww damn, again goes this shit I
Can't get out of this cycle, dish one got me whipped
From the thought of a brain bashing, Doctor stop me
Before I blow my motherfuckin top G

[Verse Two: Ruck and (Rock)]
See that leather sofa over there? (Yeah)
Sit back with this six-pack and a spliff
That have your mind twisted while we chit-chat (I like that)
I think that, we should start with the session (Uh-huh)
But before we begin let me ask you a few questions (Uh-huh)
Have you been touched the wrong way? (Nah)
Involved in gun play (Yeah)
The town let me guess acquited like you was O.J. (How'd you know?)
Typical black life you jack knifes under a sea biscuit
Get specific and stop fuckin around wit that crack rock
(Yo I don't smoke doze)
Yes you do Duke I can tell
Cuz you actin funny, like when blacks get money
(Bummy Jab only married to Jawana
And instead of helping you're getting me heated like a sauna)
Just trying to get into your head
Pardon the way I treat you
Tell me bout your scar, did your momma beat you (Nah man)
Fuck the mystery Duke tell me your history
You're pissin me off
Plus the time keep on slippin' see

I need a doctor to give me some therapy
I need a doctor to check my, my brain

[Verse Three: Rock and (Ruck)]
As I think back, to the nineties
That's when life got extra grimy
Multiplied with a fleet behind me
Wasn't smart to try me, physical fam gave less than a
Which added on to eighties anger tearing through my inner
(Now we're gettin somewhere, yah) It's all becoming clear
I always feared I have to play the rear til I was outta here
That's when I flipped out and became a plane
That transform into a robot Rokk Da Kids was his name
(One of them Decep niggas) Yup takin dope clothes and then some
I bend some (did you have any legal source of income?)
I said farewell to welfare crazy long ago
They want you to work for them peanuts now
Man you need a shrink if you think I'mma go (huh)
Then any thoughts and hopes of rehabilitation
Were chilled when I lost my nigga Phil it's been downhill
Ever since, and ain't nobody helpin me
So I came to you, the Doctor Killpatients for therapy

[Hook: Vinia Mojica]
I need a doctor to give me some therapy
I need a doctor to check my, my brain

[Verse Three: Ruck]
Bust the prognosis, better yet Duke have a dosage
Of prescribed poetry that people perceive as potent
I've been goin through your file and I found a conclusion
That you destined to be the best in this world of confusion
You lose when you fall victim to evil ways
I know crime pays but the rhyme slays nowadays
Take two of these and if you have a problem at all
I'm on call twenty-four hours to brawl, word is bond

And we into peelin back po-po caps
Ease to the stash spot, hopped out the Glock
11 o'clock news, one-time’s got shot
And ain’t nobody knowin who did it, no not a trace
Layin in the cut so I don’t catch a case
But the next time I get my ass jacked by a cop
You heard another one of them fools got that ass popped
Buck-buck the police, buck-buck your whole crew

Waiting for me with a ice cold brew
You all frisky in some shorts lookin sexy
Chokin on a blunt, sippin hene-rock and pepsi
The way you bops your head, you arouse me
And when you rocks the bed, you never lousy
And when we ridin, you be watchin my back
You know all the DT cars from Silver Bullet to the Pontiac
Sunbird, and in one word
I ain't worried bout you settin me up
That shit is unheard
You caught a case on the strength of me
And didn't get brand new
You stayed true, you could be my boo

Chorus:

I like the way you walk
The way you make me feel
And the way you talk
Those things, they turn me on
You're leanin in your Lex
And you on the phone
The way you care for me
I always got your back and you know its true
Nothin for you baby, that I won't do
You could be my boo

Verse Two:

And that gear you be sportin, it don't be overclassy
Tennis skirts and boots, and you be lookin sassy
And when you doze on the one piece dress
You lookin like something that God did bless
And when I tell you (hurry the fuck up!)
My time you never take up
Naturally cute, so you never wear makeup
Bout 125, 130
And down to hold my shit, whenever i'm dirty
Saw me ???? you got back
Second time you didn't snitch
You never riff, when I call you a bitch
Cause you know it's just a figure of speech
Some ghetto terminology you learn on the streets
It's cool when the day goes by, I didn't peep ya
You said 8-double-0 spells Boo in my beeper
I'm-a keep you on my team, knowyamean
No matter what we go do, you could be my boo

Chorus

Verse Three:

You ain't never been shy
You always stay fly
Never lie
You get that money from that other guy
You be knowin about sports
You up on all the slang
When you hang wit your gang
And the whole sh-bang
You kick game, you ain't perfect
But you real
You cook my favorite meal
And got my name on your fingernail
When you around my niggas
Everything be like, What up?
You know when to talk
And you know when to shut up
You ain't scared of guns, and you know how to use it
You love Rap City, and you love rap music
And when we fight, you go for yours
You don't be duckin
You so wild, you smoke a blunt while we fuckin
You hate the cops with a passion
You like one of my niggas
But in the female fashion
Ever since I met cha
I knew I had to get cha
Never nothing new since your debut
You could be my boo

Outro:

If you down wit my crew
You could be my boo
You look rough and sexy
Then you could be my boo
Word, if you never act brand new
You could be my boo
You sip henne-rock and pepsi
You still could be my boo
Yo, if you like to smoke mad blunts
You could be my boo
And you ain't gotta be rich
You could be my boo
You love to cuss and use a bad word
You could be my boo
Even if you act like a bitch
Then you could be my boo

[Intro: 2Pac and (?)]
Between you and Biggie it was like, who's going to rule the
Nigga kingdom and shit, basically, know what I'm saying?
I was like, this is like a fucking election
It is that
(You know what I am saying)
Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like…

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Verse 1 - The Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight. The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Verse 2 - 2Pac]
(It's on me), but still I'm having memories
Of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Outro - 2Pac]
They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
I was more shocked than anything, you know what I'm saying?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him... Pac is a strong dude, yo
I know dude, you know what I'm saying? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, ""Again?"" you know what I'm sayin'?
He always getting shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm saying? But when he, when he died
I was just like, ""whoa"", you know what I'm saying?
Kinda took me by
I mean even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody, you know what I'm sayin'
Because there ain't no coming back from that

I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
When you're face to face with your adversity
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually

[Verse 1: Consequence, Q-Tip]
Yo I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game
(What's your name?) Consequence, I'm tight, burnt like flames
(And why's that?) American dreams, they got this ghetto kid in a fiend

Don't stress that cause it's not in your bloodstream
Your whole being, comes from greatness, d'you remember
Shaytan got you caught in the storms of December
And brothers on the block packing nines like September
Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender

Yo I be on the avenue where they be actin brand new
I'm splurging on these Reebok joints for shorty boo

All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin'
Talking out they joints but they wasn't saying nuttin'
My hand was on my toolie they was actin unruly
(Say word) Yo word up, yo I was tight caught up
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies

Yo we was at the dice game making these cats look silly
Flamming, steady running off at the Willie

I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough
I gotta see some loot so on my girls I blow
Shook them shits in my palm let em hit the flo'
Kept my eyeballs scoping for them pigs po-po
I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo'
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo

And I was doing it, til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite

Yo I know the feeling, when you feeling like a villain
You be having good thoughts but the evils be revealin'
And the stresses of life can take you off the right path (no doubt)
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past
All adversities, so we can get through fast, like that

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Consequence]
You got the N.W.O. (low cash flow)
Your baby's on the way (and you don't know who)
And crosstown niggas trying to (bust at you)
Aiyyo they got me stressed out (and you don't know what to do)
So frame this Kodak black, and vision to my contact
With a poultry scrap, workers get pistol smacked
The switch hitting Queens, niggas liquid sword spittin
With raw poppy, and now your first love is krill
Your vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover
Tried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover
And all I want is my laceration of the pie
To get this whip cream before the water runs dry
Niggas flash dancing, yo, I don't know why
You're sick of snitching, she got you cruising to the pokey
Like Smokey, the stress be trying to squeeze out a homey
While I be trying to get star status like Shinobi
So we can build a dynasty, just like the Toby's
And all I want, is the world to know my steez
These money hungry niggas is seven thirty
And got me stressed out like these frog emcees

[Chorus]

I ain't never had nuttin in my whole life
I'm from the ghetto grew up, on eggs and rice
I'm paranoid I can't sleep cause I done stole a ki
Peeped out the window unmarked car after me
My little homie downstairs holla, ""Five-oh!""
But I ain't runnin from no motherfuckin white folks
I got the A-K spray hit the window (lay it down) duck
So nigga holla, god damn I hit him in the trunk
The dogs chase me but a nigga ran through the back
That's when I seen Dopefiend Willy in the Cadillac
He said, ""P where ya goin man? Get in!""
Put the gat to his head said interstate 10
Play it off, play it off, 'fore I do ya trick
Take me to the projects, to meet my bitch
A hundred G's, two ki's, and a bullet-proof vest
And like Billy the Kid I got some pussy and headed to the West

I was pullin up out the driveway
Car been parked since Friday
I looked and look back it wasn't there
But I saw him followin on the highway
And I today, know that I'ma blast
See I don't know who in it because the cars wiz-window was tinted
And I be seein shit that ain't there
It ain't there but I be seein shit
I be in places without bein seen there
But be seein a place without even bein there
And it seems like I'm in a different time zone
This dope game coke game got my mind, gone got my mind gone
I be havin nightmares everyday, I'll be woke but I'll be sleep
I looked at Shock the nigga but I turned around and it was me
It got me 'noid..

But I ain't paranoid!

Torture me until I tell 'em 'bout my man and point the dopehouse out

Be always tryin to get in the best players spot and
Knockin, motherfuckers heads off and cris-crossin

Taught me how to measure grams, cook rocks, and chop weights
Caught a case, cuz you're boy ran his mouth too much
And it's a disgrace how the pain felt to miss your touch
But as the days keep passin, keep it actin with stacks of letters
Hit you so you don't forget us
When you'd rather not be livin in the cella
Hella muthafuckas want your occupation
But they can keep pacin, cuz I'm gonna be waitin on my Baby...

CHORUS:

T-Boz:
And all this love, is waiting for you
My baby... Sweet Darling...
And all this love is waiting for you

Da Brat:
Don't worry bout a thing, nigga stay down
As long as you can hang, I'm-a be around

Da Brat:
Ran into your boy, had heard he'd spread the word
That you was soft, braggin he collecting your cheese
And pissing me the fuck off
The first thought of committing a felony never left
I missed the big breaths you took when we waz puffin an L
Just the little things you do with the bigger ones I
Saw better SL 500s colorful Gucci sweaters and leathers
Diamond letters girl you broke, I saved the sugar for you
Keep the business runnin, droppin off keys in Cancun
Cash rules, and you remain to be the King of my throne
Position taken, flippin calender pages till you get home
Wanna blast your boy for snatchin up my happiness
But I regret what'll happen to this dollar foundation
If I'm incarcerated
Too you can make it through, we bail on the Jealous
Who tell us the opposite of that
Forever you and Brat
I tried to take the blame, but you prefered to handle my fame
So i'm waitin with open arms to rekindle the flame...

Chorus {2x}:  Mr. Mixx
I wanna do the damn thaaaaAAANG! (Then do the damn thing!)
I wanna do the damn thaaaang! (Then do the damn thing!)


Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
I'm a bad motherfucker bringin' hoes to their knees
Fresh Kid Ice, long dick Chinese
Always on a mission 'cause I like to fuck
The way I hit the pussy is in the buck
Strokin' up and down, always takin' my time
Doin' it all till I make you mine
I rub your body with motion lotion
Lick you down like waves in the ocean
Do it till you're satisfied
Have you moan even though you're tired
I've fucked many bitches across the land
And no one slangs dick like the Chinaman
You ain't been fucked 'cause your pussy's froze
Many are called but few are chose
Bust them guts like it ain't no thing
So bitch stop frontin', let's do the damn thing!

Chorus

Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
Bitch, do you wanna swing with me?
Sex is the best with Brother Marquis
All hoes let my record show
All my bitches come back for more
It must be the way I throw my thang
It must be the way I spit my game
Look 'em in they eye, tell a quick lie
Kiss 'em and they cry, I don't know why
Game so strong, yet so convincin'
Give me a minute, I'm up in it
Talk 'em out they draws real cool
""Bitch, give it up smooth, you know the rules!""
True love ain't so hard to find
It's right between your legs and mine
None of my bitches, they never complain
They like the way I do the damn thing!

Chorus

Verse 3
[Marquis]  I love it when a bitch be like pro-per
A hooche with a coochie that'll let me pop her
The ""Blac Vagina Finda""
Once I'm inside I must remind her
Pussy's deception, dick's a weapon
After I fuck, I'm steppin'
Damn right, ain't nothin' changed
That's the way I do my thang!
[Kid Ice]  Let me do it, like nothin' before
I don't need a friend, I need a whore
I need a bitch who'll fuck all night
Take plenty of dick, and the pussy's right
She'll keep me goin' till she gets me off
And bring me up, when I'm soft
Let's get together 'cause it ain't no thang
You and me, baby, doin' the damn thang!

Chorus

Mr. Mixx:
(Do the damn thang!)  Hey, I'm doin' it, baby!
(Now rub the damn thang!)  Damn right, I'm rubbin' it, baby!
(Kiss the damn thang!)  Mmmmm-kissin'in' it, baby!
(Now do the damn thang!)  Then turn around, baby!
UHH!  UHH!  Now throw the damn thaaAANG!
Throw, throw it!  Throw, the damn thang, baby! {2x}

No matter what your name is, bitch I make you famous

Frankie Cutlass put me on so I'm back again
Ain't nothin changed it's still the same
Ain't no smilin' friend

I was the only one gettin' weight from upstate
Gettin cake, Juice Crew All-Stars was my boys
Runnin round town baby makin' mad noise
Backtrack turn back the page
Live on stage, wreckin' niggas at a early age

And every record that I make, I make history
Like a-oh-oh-oh, WHA-OHH! ah-one two
Is some of the things that I used to do, but
Right about now I got a different flow
I rock from New York City to Mexico
From England, Australia, back to Japan
They know I'm Mista Magic Cool with the mic in my hand
So, you know I got more rhymes than Muhammad Ali
That's why my name rings bells internationally
Never neglected well protected as an MC yet
I'm, super duper with the rhymes I invent

Tell me what you see, and uhh, vectorize
When you, check your eyes, baby, recognize, it's the
Rawest chump to make the verse in the chorus bump
With rhymes skills to be retarded like Forrest Gump
Now feel the pain runnin' through your chest area
Thoughts of the attack it got you fearin' the
Bodily abuse, that you phony niggas makin' me produce
Warfare put to use, fuck all that, just turn me loose
Huh, and this is for those who don't know the half
I want to see just how well you know your math
Now, in case a nigga want to get out of line
Just tell me how many times does sixteen go into nine
See, a lot of you rappers like to front as if you're ruthless
But, when I'm around you make all kind of excuses
Like, ""I just remembered, yo, my niece need diapers kid
Plus I got homework, bible-study, all types of shit""
Boo-yaka, any fuckin' tune to ya

One more thing, the next example one of you niggas is bout to be it
Now close your eyes tight cause trust me you don't want to see it

It was this bitch that I knew back from '86
Graduated and made it from the college of dicks
Now who the fuck you be, bitch you know me
Tryin to act solo, down low, hush-hush, and lo-key
Nah ho I ain't po', where did my motherfuckas go
I remember this ho, she used to do nails for Rochelle's, well
How the hell you been since I had no job
Hum, why don't you give me some
Cause you know I flow and run for Suave
Nah, all of that was on the couch
No doubt y'all records spin, y'all shippin in gold
It's cold On The Outside Lookin In (Brrrr!)
You'd besta make yourself worthy
Cause I got a click of niggas ready to get their johnson very dirty
You heard me push these thirty dicks, inside your pearly clit
Ain't this a bitch
I remember when you would not give me shit
Now you down for them habits
Put your numbers on the napkin
Make it snappy cause I got to go to the bathroom

Chorus:

Hoes with no clothes showin' love
Shakin that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothes showin' love
Shakin that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothe showin' love
Shakin that ass in the club nigga what?
Hoes with no clothes showin' love
Shakin that ass in the club nigga what?

[Eightball]
No different from the rest
She's just an ordinary ho
Hair extensions, long nails, ass thicker than gumbo
Make it fast, takin cash, shakin ass in the mix
Tens turn to twenties and twenties come from plenty tricks
Niggas in love
Can't stay out the club
All in the ho's face
But at the end of the paper chase, whatever you had will be erased
I see him in the back
Countin up that chedder
Talkin' loud, smokin hay, makin clouds, gettin ready for the crowd
I think I know one
I remember you, oh yes I do
Tryin to highside from me and my crew, but ain't no love lost boo
What time the club close, at 3
What's up, you comin with me
We can smoke up mad trees after you get up off your knees
You want some cheese
Hoes don't stay at the suave house
Hoes around my nuts like knats
Real dogs don't pay for cats, dats
For real baby
Recognize and sho me love, dig that shit, sho nuff

Chorus

[MJG]
Well I be God damned, this stout ass ho
Wants to get close to me
A few years back in the past, you wouldn't of even noticed me
Quoting the, lyrics of the songs that you know I flow
Lookin for, confidants, and tickets to my next show
Check yo' bitch
In these short ass pants and blow up dresses
I can tell they freaky with out three guesses
Oh yes it's very true
Your bitch'll be needin me, leavin you
Hell, now what the fuck is a nigga like me supposed to do
Let her loose or let her remain
Cause all she be lookin for is some fame
A bigger name
Lil' Miss Thang with bigger game
And she claim she ain't heard my music
Tryin to trick me
So I told that ho my name Bill Bixby
She still hit me
Now she, killin my dick softly with her mouth and I
Really just don't plan on takin it out cause I
MJ fuckin G you needs to knows 'bout these hoes shakin
They ass with no clothes like some pros, sho nuff

It's a damn shame

It was something we could resist

Song:   If I Could Change

Fast livin' got me trapped in this street game
Before i die i hope i have a chance to make a change
4x

I'm at the time in my life when a nigga ready to change
I'll be dead or in jail if I don't shake this thang
Feel like I'm trapped in a prison, slowly waiting to die
It's getting harder for my people, yet we don't know why
They cuttin sistas off welfare, these kids can't eat
And it's the children like ? turned out by the street
I couldn't see it while I was outside slangin my rocks
Servin' death to my people, commitin the ultimate evil
Robbin' and killin' my own kind, Lord forgive me
Blinded by this life of crime, God somebody hear me
Since the death of my momma, my life is filled with drama
Lost both of my kids, punished for what dirt that I did
I can't bring em back, so I get high to forget
All the mistakes that I made, that time won't let me erase
I keep my head up high, but I'm stuck in this game
Steady checkin' myself, God help me to change

Chorus 4x

If I could change, I'd bring my momma back from the grave
I ain't got too much trouble cause we livin' in the last days
Crime pays, doing broads can get you AIDS, gotta wear a strap these days
All the time I stay high, trying to fight my stress
Jealous fool of the world trying to put me to rest
Last night i had a talk with my momma
Then the cry, asking god if she'd serve a purpose before she dies
You can see it in my eyes, a brotha wanta slow down
I ain't mad at ya daddy cause you didn't come around
I'm knowing that the times is hard, but you can make it
You see the opportunity, you take it
But what about my little baby, I got a mouth to feed
But i still wanta hang on the streets and smoke weed with the O.G.'s
My homies rest in peace in the game
I don't think you'll ever know the pain
I wanta change

Chorus 4x

Lord know, picute me ballin
Trapped in this ghetto with my young G's callin
Henacee and weed when they bury P
A quarter key, 6 G's, when they carry me
Fall on my knees to no nigga
Trapped in this hood, raised by chrome trigga
Never had a pops, a nigga learned to slang cream
Should have been a chemist, the way i work a triple beam
Life, is like a page, I wanta turn
I wanta make a change, but Lord you let my brotha burn
I done seen a nigga lose his life over zurcubian stones
Everynight, my auntie bring a nigga home
Momma worrying cause the rent late
3 strikes, my cousin's doing time upstate
I sent him Camel with no filters
I'm in the ghetto slangin stones with staight killas, ugghh
I know kids that pack gats cause they bout it, bout it
I'm from the murder capital of the world and we rowdy, rowdy
Is there a heaven for a gangsta, Lord put me to sleep
Cause your best friend turn into your enemy
Crooked cops is dirty in this shaded game
Go on take me out the ghetto

Nah, chill.....it was December
True...cuz that's when L started his bid
Partied through the New Year
January third he slid
Up until then, yo, L had it swell
Called him Sweet Pea like his name was Pernell
He did the job, money came with ease
Blowing outta town, moving bricks and ki's
Him and his bitch, in forty-G rides
Holding down fort like they Bonnie N Clyde
Luxury cars of all makes and models
New outfits everyday, downin' champagne by the bottle
Glass in the air (air)
Toast to my team (team)
Toast to my cream and the scotties that beam

Passed the German AK

Got work release after doing a 3-to-life bid
Cause of drug logic
Shouldn't touch it
Now out to budget
With a movie star chick from outta Edenwald Projects
Nice job, took prison camp drives
While he promised up and down to live a civilized lifestyle
The sweat off the brow was soon on garment
Both worked
Got themselves a two-bedroom apartment
Great statement, without delayment, away and went
Saved to get a house on one of them low down payments
But an idea concocted his stock
Why don't we try and turn this money over on the drug tip
So he gave his man a shriek and excitement
Didn't know his peeps were under secret indictment
Sick of the path that'll get you hung by the neck
Sent him back up north to do a super long stretch again

Every day I wake up, I hope I'm dreamin'
I can't believe this shit
Can't believe you ain't here
Sometimes it's just hard for a nigga to wake up
It's hard to just keep goin'
It's like I feel empty inside without you bein' here
I would do anything man, to bring you back
I'd give all this shit, shit the whole lot
I saw your son today, he look just like you
You was the greatest, you'll always be the greatest
I miss you B.I.G
Can't wait til that day, when I see your face again
I can't wait til that day, when I see your face again
Yeah, this right here, tell me why
Goes out, to everyone, that has lost someone
That they truly loved, c'mon, check it out

[Verse 1]
Seems like yesterday we used to rock the show
I laced the track, you locked the flow
So far from hangin' on the block for dough
Notorious, they got to know that
Life ain't always what it seem to be
Words can't express what you mean to me
Even though you're gone, we still a team
Through your family, I'll fulfill your dream, that's right
In the future, can't wait to see
If you open up the gates for me
Reminisce some time, the night they took my friend
Try to black it out, but it plays again
When it's real, feelings hard to conceal
Can't imagine all the pain I feel
Give anythin' to hear half your breath, half your breath
I know you still livin' your life, after death

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinkin' of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you

[Verse 2: Puff Daddy]
It's kinda hard with you not around
Know you in heaven smilin' down
Watchin' us while we pray for you
Every day we pray for you
'til the day we meet again
In my heart is where I'll keep you, friend
Memories give me the strength I need to proceed
Strength I need to believe
My thoughts Big I just can't define
Wish I could turn back the hands of time
Us in the six, shop for new clothes and kicks
You and me takin' flicks
Makin' hits, stages they receive you on
Still can't believe you're gone
Give anything to hear half your breath
I know you still livin' your life, after death

[Refrain: Faith Evans]
Every step I take, every move I make
Every single day, every time I pray
I'll be missing you
Thinkin' of the day, when you went away
What a life to take, what a bond to break
I'll be missin' you

[Interlude: Faith Evans]
Somebody tell me why
One black morning
When this life is over
I know
I'll see your face

Every move I make, every single day

With the every spot where nobody got insurance

Get cut with Gillettes
We built this concept, connect like Nynex
Drinks at the bar, my American Express

[Interlude: Wyclef Jean]
Yo I cook up cook up
The copper pull up pull up
Then I cuff up cuff up
You who's calling bluff
Now you shook up shook up
Cause you lock up lock up
When I love up love up
You who's calling bluff

Hey yo, John is chilling
Dirty Cash dealing
What more can I say, we living
That's what we got, we got it good
And since you understood
We be..

[Pras]
Yeah
Live at the Carnival

[Intro: 2Pac]
There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future
But through whatever you see
Through all the rain and the pain
You gotta keep your sense of humor
You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit
Remember that!
Mmm, yeah, keep ya head up! Yeah

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Our lifestyles be close-captioned
Addicted to fatal attractions
Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlers hardly think of culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent
Buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe
If you believe, then you can achieve; just look at me!
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!

[Hook: Johnny P & (2Pac)]
Smile for me, won't you smile? (Smile for me now)
Just smile, smile for me (Smile)
(What you lookin' all sad for?
Nigga, you black, smile for me now)
Smile for me
(Nigga, you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile? (No doubt, smile for me now)
Just smile (And the next generation)

[Verse 2: Scarface]
Now, as I open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my 9th grade, dealin' cocaine
Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!

[Hook: Johnny P]
Smile for me, won't you smile?
Just smile, smile for me
Smile for me
Won't you smile? Just smile

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Fuck the world, as we elope and witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin'
Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'
Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhalin' sherm smoke, visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries
Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge is ""Fuck friends!""
We military minded soldiers
Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah
To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words, make the world change
And still I smile, nigga

[Bridge: Scarface]
And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace
May the angels help to lead the way
May the prayers that our families made
Shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac

[Hook: Johnny P]
Smile, smile for me
All you need to do is smile
Woooo smile for me
Come on, smile for me

If you wanna be with me, well well well, let me hear you say Warren G

Warren G-
Smokin me out to the finish, I thought you knew
I thought they knew, who was up in this
Ron Isley, I's be Warren G
Baby said would ya please come roll deep
Chocolate Thai, I said I
Got the hennessey chaser, skirt you look fly
Peepin them lips, hittin two finger sips
On the 710 freeway, I straight dips
Wit a fat one rolled up to puff
I'm ready to hit it and I won't quit it until I get enough
Tokin nothing but the bomb thats without no doubt
As she twist up another split she's straight smokin me out

(Chorus) Ron Isley-
She's smokin me out, smokin me out
Smokin me out, smokin me out
Oh she's smokin me out with the homey's love

Warren G-
I slinkin while I'm thinkin just how good it is
To do it how we do it in the hood I live
Passin homies on the block, gettin major respect
And by then y'all the hen dog is taken effect
Never panic hit Atlantic then I banked to right
Pulled straight Nellin B's order steak and rice
With the gravy, baby gets the shrimps and fries
I'm diggin on her figure as I glimpse her thighs
She's satisfied, I left the tip and dipped to get back
To twist another zag and to grab a six pack
She went back, so we proceed to parlay
Everything is lovely and we doin it always

(Chorus) x2

This ain't no love ballad
But see baby I gots to have it
When I see that bomb I grab it, cuz its a habit
So dont come with that toe down stretch
I ain't stressin, Long Beach baby keep smokin me out, she learned a lesson
Floatin high as a kite as I chill and lay low
Bumpin time is collected, sunday nights on the radio
Oh, I forgot, how lit I was, crazy glued to the seat
Dog said she need
So conversation ain't needed
When she know that I'm weeded
Headin to the hotel to regulate it and beat it
I exhaled, I seen a cloud of smoke
I banged it to the boogie by my head and got locced

What's yo' naaaaaame?
[ODB] {burp} My name is, Ol Dirty Bastard,  and I'mma Alkaholik
[Tash] Yeah me too nigga
[ODB] {singin' some crazy shit}

[Verse 1: Tash]
You're now rockin' with Tha Liks so start reachin' for the ozone
I see some girls I know but y'all look different with your clothes on
What's up though, Tash came to steal it like the Grinch
While I'm leavin' niggas puzzled like I said my shit in French
But it's all Olde English that I'm bringin' from beneath
Try to bite my style on wax and watch these lyrics crack your teeth
Cause I make words Connect like West Side when I test glide
My drunken lyrical hanglider, nobody's tighter
Than a ruff rap provider, with ninety ways to peel ya
So I know the three words (Tash'll kill ya) sound familiar
I filter out the weak everytime I speak
I drink to hit the peak to make my mind go (beep)
I'm def-da-fyin', you rappin' like my client
Tryin' to scrape me for the style that slam harder than Kobe Bryant
Be quiet! This is Likwidation from the West
Motherfuck ya boozy show, I got my own special guest

[Verse 2: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yo, yo, breaker breaker breaker one-nine
I bust this bitch in the behind with the silver shine
Cause she thought she was fine
She winked at me, I thought it was fine
This nigga Poutin, this ho' was mine
I had the alcohol in me, took my time
Let a nigga ro-tate turn on the table
Put in the diamond needle, pull it to your ego
What? You the king in the chair on my ground
The Tyson of sound, it's twenty seconds to a round
Scavenger nigga, youse a shrimp, a full line of shit
My ear can't digest it
Stop drinkin' all that motherfuckin' water, let's take it to the land
So I can Godzilla up your sheeit, Mr. Tiny Tim man
Niggas be creepin' up my beanstalk
When I start to come down on your fuckin' asses
Try to chip shit on up, get these nuts
Motherfucker WHAT!!

[Verse 3: J-Ro]
The Ro pimped the flow like a ho, so I should rap on the mack-raphone
My rhymes hittin' hard enough to crack a bone
I divide square MC's like math
Bend you in half and drink a Genuine Draft
I stop him, then I skied out with all wampum
When he's layin' on the ground, I let my Dog Scrilla chop him
(Switch reels) I feels its all about skills
The outcome's unbelievable like Tyson/Holyfield
Your lyrics are loaners return em to they rightful owners
My style is wild, like G's or the pistolas
No need to ask, I put you on like a ski mask
We can Fight the Power like this was P.E. class
I Bomb Squads like Hank Shock
Peace to my nigga Scott puttin' stickers on the block
*burp* I drink more Brewsters than Punky
It's the further adventures of the hip-hop drunkies

[Chorus]
You bitches are hoes
Put it in ya neck my motherfuckin' ho
Or in your butt hole
Wherever the fuck it goes
You bitches are hoes
Put it in ya neck my motherfuckin' ho
Or in your ear hole
Wherever the fuck it goes

Yeah, yo, yo, yo
No disrespect to any architect
Who tried to perfect, oh what the heck
I'm a MC director, rhyme inspector
Rated top ten, Brooklyn borough sector

Its the Packtown original b-boy I'm rappin'
What's happenin', so dope got the pope clappin'
I'm smackin', on some chicken, what you kickin'
You trickin', while I'm vickin' hoes you stick your dick in

[Tash]
Step outta place, Tash'll smack your taste out your face
Cause there's nowhere to hide unless you move to outer space
Cause I waste motherfuckers like toxic fumes
So you betta (make room) when you hear the (boom boom)

[Verse 5]
[Ol Dirty (rapping like RZA)]
Hey sugar plum, how can you assume
That the pitch of the volume, doesn't have no tune
I'm not your everyday, regular rap star peddler
One on one at your rap seminar
Beware of the Hard Way, Three's the Hard Way
At you fuckers

[J-Ro]
So aiyyo, my name is J-Ro
And my style is so dope they call it ya-yo
I don't rap fast, I love green grass
Nuttin nice on the mic, call me a mean ass

[Verse 6]
[Ol Dirty (still rapping like RZA)]
Extra da-llama, bring hahaha
Extra extra bring the da-llama
Verse a better one, then slice-a-versa
God acre, massacre murdered
Also known as a rap wrecka, not a rhyme rebel
You're just rhyme to survive streets
True beaters, minerals and rhymes survive lyrics
Like the acre without the attic, but not the only Asiatic
True God but my dick is my lightnin' rob
Ho don't kick that mumbo jumbo

[Tash]
See this the type of shit niggas don't try at home
I come funkin' up the spot like Micheal Jordan's cologne
With the mega drunken, style to keep the crowd pumpin'
Niggas lookin' at me like, 'Tash is up to somethin'
(Get drunk and I stumbled) but I didn't come to trip
I came to bring it to ya humb-le
Tumb-le all your plots and all your plans
Ol Dirty's in the house and that's my motherfuckin' man!

I'm the D to the A to the D-D-Y
Know you'd rather see me die than to see me fly
I call all the shots, rip all the spots
Rock all the rocks, cop all the drops
I know you thinking now, ""When all the ballin' stops?""
Nigga never home, gotta call me on the yacht
Ten years from now we'll still be on top
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop
Now what you gon' do with a crew
That got money much longer than yours
And a team much stronger than yours?
Violate me, this'll be your day, we don't play
Mess around, be D.O.A. be on your way
‘Cause it ain't enough time here
Ain't enough lime here for you to shine here
Deal with many women but treat dimes fair
And I'm bigger than the city lights down in Times Square

[Hook: Kelly Price]
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
B-I-G P-O-P-P-A, no info for the DEA
Federal agents mad ‘cause I'm flagrant
Tap my cell and the phone in the basement
My team supreme, stay clean
Triple beam lyrical dream, I be that
Cat you see at all events bent
Gats in holsters, girls on shoulders
Playboy, I told ya, mere mics to me
Bruise too much, I lose too much
Step on stage, the girls boo too much
I guess it's ‘cause you run with lame dudes too much
Me lose my touch? Never that!
If I did, ain't no problem to get the gat
Where the true players at? Throw your Rolies in the sky
Wave 'em side to side and keep your hands high
While I give your girl the eye, player please
Lyrically, niggas see B.I.G be flossin’
Jig on the cover of Fortune, 5 double O
Here's my phone number, your man ain't got to know
I got the dough, got the flow down pizat
Platinum plus like thizat
Dangerous on trizacks, leave your ass flizat

[Hook repeats till end]
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

Uhh, yeah, phenomenon, yeah
[Yvette] Ooooh, yeah, baby far from yours, ohh yeah

Verse One: O.C

Yo, time is most limited I'm back on the scene
O replenishes, potency like four or five Guinnesses
Hennessey's flourishing, O.C.is nourishing
Performin miracles, ill and mad lyrical
What stands before your very eyes is a
One man stand-alone phenomenon
Microphone misery you sufferin, taste my repetoire
In your face like a buck fifty, done with the razor
I'm felt by Aztecs, felt by Asians
Portuguese Lebanese and even Caucasians
Every form of power, they respect my stats
Slap me five, with former leader drink Cognac with diplomat
Retard your whole brigade, cave in your brain waves
(With subliminal messages) makin party people slaves
Ya hit reverse to rewind, and defy my cause
""One thing I do is keep em different, and far from yours""

Chorus One: Yvette Michelle

He's no average M.C., with a smile on his face
Though they'll try to bite his style, no one can duplicate

Verse Two: O.C

I be the chosen one, beyond the Moet and Cristal
A son of King and a Queen, therefore ability
For song run in my genetics
I gave ideas to L. Ron Hubbard to write books on Dianetics
FedEx your info, if you wanna show the manager
Mr. Dave make sure give us a good payday too
I was assigned to Earth, on a mission
To spread worldwide my glorious compositions
Notes are like B sharps floatin
Out of my mouth from start to finish til the song diminish
My lyrical energy bring out envy in most MC's
Who listen to O, he didn't know me before
Then you know who I are now, bitin my style
That's a crime to be dealth with but we take it to trial
Verdict is in, the judge know my beef has cause
""One thing I do is keep em different, and far from yours""

Chorus Two: Yvette Michelle

He's no average MC, with a smile on his face
And though you try to bite his style, no one can duplicate
He can flow anywhere ya want, he can rhyme any time you say
And he's never ever ever too far, from tomorrow, today

Verse Three: O.C

You may never find a MC well orchestrated like a symphony
Some'll go down in history, some in infamy
The infamy will be somewhat a mystery
As long as my name O.C. live on through infinity
My identity, will ring bells in all facilities
From fans to enemies I'm the antidote and remedy
I'mma philosophize, analyze, no question
If I die I'mma return like Jesus' resurrection
I'm a blessin to the rap game, my claim to fame is when
I dissapear reappear, I put rappers to shame
Plain and simple, in common English, what I distinguish
The meanest lyric flamethrower your career's over
Finesse a mic Casanova, Don Juan or MC
The people need a change, this rap shit is deranged
Yo Raider, flip the fader, let em know my cause
""One thing I do is keep em different, and far from yours""

Chorus Two (Roc Raider cuts and scratches the ""one thing"" sample)
Chorus Two repeats

[Yvette] Never too far, never...

Down for yours if you're down for mine
Ooooooo....
Nastyboy Klick, I would die for you
Down for yours if you're down for mine
Ooooooo....
Nastyboy Klick, are you down for your dj?
Down for yourz if you're down for mine

I'll be that man dropping skill
Give your body chills
Let me wine and dine you boo
No doubt that I'll be good to you
I like a girl that always gots my back
Whenever I need her she'll be standing with a mac
If you down to represent
And put your trust in me
Ain't scared of no guns
And let me run the street
Let me do what I gotta do
And show you I'm fine, love you blind
It's just that hook-ups take time
Ain't gotta have ends or a place to live
Smoking fat phillys
I'm still down wit you kid
So if you want it, come and get it, don't take too long
Cause in the valley of AZ
Finding fly females ain't hard
So come and take a ride
And if you swing to this bounce
Room 6-0-duece
That's what I'm all about
Fulfill your fantasies
And all of your desires
Lay back, pop the top up
And let me take you higher

[Chorus]
Loving you this way, I'll never lead you astray
I knew you were my D.O.G. when you put your trust in me
Down for yours if your down for mine (put your trust in me)
I'm down for yours, if your down with my flow, keep it going
I'm always down for my G
Down for yours if you're down for mine

Now all I need is a shorty with a mac like that
Victoria Secret, champagne, and bubble baths
Let the magic man rub you down like a magic lamp
And I'm getting 3 wishes
I likes that
Cause ain't nobody in this whole wide world
Abouts to giving you lovin like this Duke of Earl, uhh
Feel the lovin that I gots for you
Moet, candy, flowers and some diamonds too
Just to let you know how I feel for you
I dedicate my life and my soul to you
So now that you've been thinking of a man for your life
I promise if I get it
I'm a treat you right
Never playa hate
And always down to sex me
And every time I see you
Giving much respect to me
I'll be down for yours
If your down for mine
Cause a love like ours
Ain't easy to find

[Chorus]

What you want Goldilocks
Money can't buy
Butterscotch made divine
Styles like Calvin Klein
Design for the masses
No style you sport clashes
Hazardous to the health of all men
Beauty descends, dividends, lust remains
Heavenly same my intent ignites flames
Exclaim, never complain
To give you affection
If being right's so wrong
You never need correction
Most definitely you get the best of me at times
If lovins what I need
You supply all kinds
I see your brown eyes scheming from across the room
Checking me out but you look away....
No reason to gaze
Look where the game
Competitions the same
Too many heinas lookin good
For me and you to keep playin
So what it be
I'm down for whatever you need
Just me and you
Hand in hand
Roaming through ecstasy

[Chorus]

Down for yours, down for mine, OoOoOo....
Down for yours if you're down for mine
More bounce for my G's
You're my computer love
More bounce G's
Down for yours if you're down for mine
Down for yours if you're down for mine
I want to be your G, baby, I want to be your G
Yes I do

What's the deal son?
Firm Fiasco
It's the world famous AZ Show
For the world (AZ Show)

[AZ]
No doubt, time to mellow out
Party at the yellow house, yell it out
Invites only, don't tell no slouch
How you feel around some made cats, really on chill
Laidback with the Alize, milli's concealed
Conversating like some more pimps caught in the mix
Wasn't taught shit stressed out supporting your bitch
Let the ice shine, easing my mind with white wine
Assured lifeline, sqeezing my nine the right time
Camouflage life, feds almost bagged the god twice
Bizare nights move on the grace of Allah's light
All Armani white, feeling like Christ with the army type
Cons be writing knowing my life is based upon the hype
Burning incense with intents to school the infants
The rules are different, so for those that chose to listen
It's a dice game, never know, plans might change
Stay in your price range, far from the stress of night pains

[SWV]
Hey AZ won't you play that song
Keep me fucked up (fucked up)

Keep me fucked up (fucked up)

[AZ]
So many deaf and blind got caught up and left behind
I guess Bacardi Lime gave me my strength to go the extra nine
Next in line, slow G-ing, low key-ing
Me and the crew in the gold B.M. O.D-ing
Top speed, blowing through the sweet night breeze
Wherever life leads, anything's better besides a tight squeeze
Sliced cheese, even my pieces pushing nice v's
Dressed precisely, hoping soon one be the wifey
It's working well, process words, helping to purge and sell
Urban hell, playing park benches, burning L's
It's all basics, probation, open cases
We ill natured, being trained young from hatred
Trapped in the arms of satan, congregating
Conversating, trying to map ways of escaping
It's truth or dare, only the chosen move sincere
Keep the youth aware, pass on jewels as souvenirs

[SWV]

[AZ]
For the world
No more case pending, it's all a brand new begining
AZ I'm back winning, dressed in black linen
Attract women, low fade, waves laid and spinning
Stay paid, four different ways, put my bid in
No sleep, be playing with time, my mind goes deep
These cold streets, rock a diamond chip, gold teeth
Trying to stay sane, amongst the madness and maintain
Though the game changed, the message involved remain plain
Poor advice given, we all strive for nice living
Insights, some pay the price others spend nights in prison
Plea bargain, hoping my peoples peep the problem
We each disolving trying to make moves to keep from starving

[Intro]
I want ya'll to play this at funerals in the hood
Til all this black on black crime stop
Some say the blind lead the blind
But in the ghetto you never know
When it's gon be yo time

[Sons of Funk, Mo B. Dick, O'dell]
Sittin at the ghetto thinkin bout
All my homies passed away (uuunnnggghhh!)
Candy painted cadillacs and triple gold
That's how me and my boys rolled
How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
My best friend's gone
And I'm so all alone
I really miss my homies
Even though they gone away
I know you in a better place
And I hope to see ya soon someday

[Master P]
I used to hang with my boy even slang with my boy
Used to bang with my boy, goddam I miss my boy
We started out youngstas in the park throwin birds
In your hearse, damn it's sad to see my nigga in the dirt
The game got me workin, got me perkin, never jerkin
Still blowin dolja fo ya cause I know you up there workin
Ya little baby's cool and ya baby's mama straight
But today's a sad day to see the t-shirt with ya face
From the cradle to the grave, from the streets we used to fall
In the park you liked to ball, put yo name upon the wall
In the projects you's a legend on the street you was a star
But it's sad to see my homeboy ridin in that black car
A lotta soldiers done died, a lotta mothers done cried
You done took yo piece of the pie but you was too young to retire
Why soldiers ride for yo name leave it vain
Some Gs never change, damn they killed you for some change
Smile for my homie Kevin Miller my boy Randall
The ghetto persons that lost they loved ones to these ghetto scandals

Take a minute to smile for the dead (uuunnnggghhh!)
Smile for the dead (RIP 2Pac, Makaveli)
All my homies who done made it to the crossroads
(Biggie Smalls)

[Sons, Mo B. O'dell]
How could it be?
Somebody took my boy from me
(It's like I can't believe you gone)
My best friend's gone
(Sometimes I feel like I can't go on)
And I'm so all alone
(Everytime I see something you done left
I really miss my homies
(It just remind me, more and more of you, dawg)
Even though they gone away
(I just keep reminiscin)
I know you in a better place
(Cause I know you alright)
And I hope to see ya soon someday
(And I keep smilin, knowin I'm a see you in the crossroads]

[Pimp C]
We used to grip on the grain and flip them candy toys
But I'd give up all that bullshit if I could get back my boy
Off in the club smokin weed til 3, hollerin at the hoes
Spendin $4000 on me on gators and clothes
When I turned to rap, he had to chase the game
Nigga told me, ""C, leave that dope, cause rappin is yo thang""
I ain't gone even lie, some nights I ride and cry
Wonderin why the real niggas always the ones to die
So I just smoke my weed and try to clear my mind
I wish that I had the power to turn back the hands of time
I wonder if there's a heaven up there for real Gs
For all the niggas in the game that be sellin keys
I keep my memories, try to keep my head strong
But baby it's hard to be strong, when yo main homie gone

[Sons, Mo B. O'dell]
Even though you gone away
(Even though you gone, you ain't never gon be forgotten)
I know you in a better place
(Cause as long as I'm here
You gon live through me and other TRU playas)
I really miss my homies
Even though they gone away
I know you in a better place
And I hope to see ya soon someday

[Silkk]
I'm just sittin here dazed thinkin bout all the times we had
Thinkin the past, some was good and some was bad
Remember Dante?
It was a group of us, just a group of five
Now three dead, one in jail, it seem right now I'm the only one alive
To all my soldiers before me, may ya'll rest in peace
When He took three, took my soul, just the bodies
He at the crossroads guide us out to the rest of me
Wishin I could rewind time like demos
Me and you gettin girls, writin down numbers like memos
Makin million dollar bets, makin all our money stretch like limos
Even though I smile, it's sad, but they say gangstas can't cry
But if I close my eyes and visualize me together
Then I suddenly wanna smile
To see you laid down when it's yo time, when your time was up
You never seen your child, but he's here to remind us
Even though you was wrong, I never could belive that that was true
You was with me forever, you could check my rest in peace tattoos
See me and C and P forever gon be ridin and thuggin
Rest in peace to all the ones that didn't make it
And rest in peace to my brother
We gon miss you

(I love these fools)
I know you in a better place
(Every time I get on my knees)
And I hope to see ya soon someday
(I pray for you, I'm glad you in a better place
I hope I see ya soon, ain't no more killin
Ain't no more fights, and ain't no more tears)

Fat fat thick booty, what?
You say jack that big booty, yo
He say OOH OH
I heard the boy he said OOH OH
The party people he said OOH OH
Uhh uh uh uhh yo yo yo
Check it, check it

Driftin on a memory, brought forth
From a fifth of Hennesey, as in times
Of eighty-nine they envision me
Warm days and the cold beer chemistry
Eventually broken up by responsibilities and such
Sometimes this era mentally I reconstruct
High school I came out it
Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted
Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit
My niggas be fuckin girls that she hang out with
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'
Arguin over if he said, ""Dumb bitch""
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin the sun twist
Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit
Afterparties in Wendy's parkin lot, unfamiliar faces got marked a lot
Showin off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box
That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped

Chorus: Chantay Savage

It's remind-ing... mmm whooahhh yeahhh
It's remind-ing... heyyeahhahh, uh-huh

[Common]
Check it
Before these minds got ahold to some drugs
And start thinkin they thugs
We'd be at the Bismarck, and the Racquetball club
Plugged with Gucci promotion so we got in free
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin
Saved my day, dancin on speakers
Flames snatched I was born this way
87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin
Over gossip, Kenwood broads was pourin
Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models
And Starter coats out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD
I would quote, stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke
Behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny
It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew
Either go through it or, take it, we was bound to
Travellin like Vice Lords, down to the Taste
Not wantin to bring my lady around crew cause they would snake
House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up
At em' I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up

Chorus

[Common]
There go the break
To get the break go, it go OOH OH
Yeah, it go OOH OH
You heard the people they go oh oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Yo, check it, check it

Nowadays niggas is fake, like that party at McCormick Place
I don't draw with em, cause they was born to trace
At times I contemplate movin to a warmer place
Then the Lake and skyline, give me a warm embrace
Remindin me of the pointed parties Moe used to mace
Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin Twilight Tone tapes
Come home late callin broads hang up on they mother
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at then we would fight each other
Get a room at the Dunes havin bakeouts
We'd eat, at Giordano's and break out
Then everybody thought that they could spend
High rollers had the MCM blazer blend
Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin in
Cranes and freight trains we was breakin in
Tim a be basin Mike down at I.I.T
Rememberin numbers depended on how high I'd be
It's a Deja-Brew, when I see bottles of Gill
My man Sef passed I feel hollow but still

And then we take it higher (c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon)
Say, we gonna rock down through, the Brooklyn Avenues (Flatbush too)
And then we'll take it higher!
Ohh no!  Ohh no!

[Verse 2: Prazwell]
I dedicate this to my peeps who're on the streets
God bless they soul, may they rest in peace
There's those who finance and those who choose to lease
Whatever suits you weather on the turn of your leafs
Different strokes for different folks God
I refuse to going back and being broke Lord
He got struck with lightning, he got hit hard
Face this twenty life to maximum, his whole life is scarred
The Preacher's Son and I came off the Santa Maria
Ten cases of Malta, caught the diarrhea
Load the ReFugees on the aircraft carrier
Some say Dirty Cash (Dirty Cash) we never heard of ya
You don't know me?  (Yeah yeah)

[Chorus: Ky-Mani]
Say, we gonna rock down through Electric Avenue (c'mon)
And then we'll take it higher (c'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon)
Say, we gonna rock down through the Brooklyn Avenues (Flatbush too)
And then we'll take it higher! (c'mon man)
Ohh no!  Ohh no! (yeah, alright)

[Verse 3: Prazwell]
Watch your back watch your side, swimmin with shark
String you like a harp while they playin Mozart
No credential, get nowhere like Oslo
Stand back to Frisco, at the Rico Beagle
Suave like Rico, on fire like pyro
Frantic like a skitzo, rougher than Brillo
He caught the rap like Donnie Brascoe

[Bridge: Ky-Mani (Prazwell)]
Out in the street there is violence (yeah, uhh)
Down in Brooklyn there is violence (Flatbush too)
Down dere in Queens there is violence (QBC)
And there's a lot of work to be done, Lord
Down in the ghetto there violence (out in the streets)
Out in L.A. there is violence (Compton)
In Miami there is violence (Miami Vice, yeah)
And there's a lot of work to be done, Lord (yo, c'mon, yo)

[Chorus: Ky-Mani (Prazwell)]
We gonna rock down through, ReFugee Avenue (rock to, uh-huh)
And then we take it higher! (c'mon)
Say, we gonna rock down through, Haiti Avenue (Port-Au-Prince)
And then we take it higher!

Hey yo it's all love, but love's got a thin line
And Pun's got a big nine, respect crime but not when it reflect mine
The shit I'm on is wrong but it lasts long
Pull a fast one, then Pun'll wake up, with the stash gone
I'm mad strong, and my cream is fast
Smoke the greenest grass, my bitch got the meanest ass
And a taste legit, I don't have to waste a whole case of Crist'
All it takes is my pretty face and my gangsta wit
Lace the click, cause we all share
It's all fair like love and war, thug galore with the long hair
Big Pun, Pun the name that makes the kids run
Like spelling murder reverse it deliver redrum
Come one, come all, if you wanna brawl
I'm the mighty Thor clotheslining motherfuckers like Steven Seagal
Cause all you gonna get, is your ass kicked or up in a casket
That's it (that's it?) That's it

[Cuban Link]
Punisher bash it, at last it's, rappers that really blast shit
Cats getting Big Willie niggas like Billy Bathgate
Up in Jimmy's Cafe, havin caviar
Crackin Cristal at the bar, smokin cigars, livin large

I'm hard to kill for real nigga guard your grill
I like to chill, spark an L and get high
I'm one hell of a guy, fly pelican fly

Your career's on life support, and I'mma pull the plug

For pleasure, bring your territory terror
Keep my workers under pressure got em sayin ""FUCK LESTER""
But that's aight Duke-o, my heart nowadays too cold
Don't give a fuck where you been what you done
Where you go, you know, peep this statement
In black shades like a secret, agent
We're night thieves, roll up on you like sleeves
We light trees, bust these and stack cheese

It's off the hook this year

Out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me""

Verse One: Queen Pen

Lyrical flows like WHAT
The man behind the music'll make you JUMP
New Jack your Swing and make you SHAKE YOUR RUMP
No Diggi-ty tellin me this is WHAT YOU WANT, bass lines and snares
That'll make you hump, WHY
Intimated by his fourteen year run, WELL
In ninety-seven he's a different kind of funk, FUNK FUNK FUNK
We pulls together like a perfect hand to tongue, HAH
You pressed your luck and now you faster shit be sunk, ZOOM
Be combin through the future with your face punked, AND YOU
Forgot about the past, now what you want, platinum tracks
To put you on the map, NAH
Cause we gotta keep it in fam', YEAH
You had your chance to be down wit da man, UH-HUH
So busy playa-hatin perpetratin, frauds
Articulatin, on his downfall, TRUE, you can't take it

	What the deal Ma?
	Funky Momma blaze the track so you can feel her
	I'm Miggidy I'm all about the dollar bills y'all, rock the Diamond Lex
	All that shit behind my desk is signed in checks

[Teddy Riley]
Do you like hits baby, got em goin crazy on BlackStreet
You know it's plaque time when me and the track meet
Save all your wack beats, Q.P. and T.R
So precise with mics we should be surgeons in E.R
The block knows (like that) baby girl be my diamond cause
She rocks shows (for Black) see my ones ain't no way that
You can stop those, Little Man got your breath together
With Queen Pen now it's hot to death, so take a look back (look back)
What I did, what I'm doin, where I take this (take that)
It's kind of simple cause a n*gga just make hits (make tracks)
Peep the facts, keep a stack, on the Streets of Black
Ladies scream he's the mack, cause
I kick, sh*t to make a fly chick you with
My chick, and plus funds just ridiculous
Cause I'm rich, we are T.R. you see Q.P
That's we BlackStreet, gone!

(You, can't, take, it)

	And nowwwwwwwww... here's the magnificent...

Little Man be the sh*t, Funky Momma represent
It ain't never been no different plus WE GOT WITNESSES
To account for alla dis sh*t, test we
And get your, block knocked off, UHH
You can keep yappin UNTIL YOU GET HOARSE
It don't matter, we don't, follow chit chatter
WE MAKE HITS, and calls, when situations get thick
ASK SAINT NICK, about the repoitoire
For those in the past, they know who they are
If the shoe fits trust, WE GON WEAR IT
And we beez the baddest click up on this planet
We paid the cost to be boss G*d [damn it]
Cause scared don't win money, NOW DROP IT

[Hook]
Clap your hands everybody
If you got what it takes
Cause I'm Kurtis Blow and I want you to know
That these are the breaks

Breaks on a bus, brakes on a car
Breaks to make you a superstar
Breaks to win and breaks to lose
But these here breaks will rock your shoes
And these are the breaks
Break it up break it up break it up!

If your woman steps out with another man
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And she runs off with him to Japan
And the IRS says they want to chat
And you can't explain why you claimed your cat
And Ma Bell sends you a whopping bill
With 18 phone calls to Brazil
And you borrowed money from the mob
And yesterday you lost your job
Well, these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up

Throw your hands up in the sky
And wave em round from side to side
And if you deserve a break tonight
Somebody say alright!
(All right) Say ho-oo!
(Ho-oo!) And you don't stop
Keep on, somebody scream!
(Owwwww!) Break down!

Breaks on a stage, breaks on a screen
Breaks to make your wallet lean
Breaks run cold and breaks run hot
Some folks got 'em and some have not
But these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
Break down!

To the girl in brown, stop messing around
(Break it up, break it up!)
To the guy in blue, whatcha gonna do?
To the girl in green, don't be so mean
And the guy in red, say what I said
Break down!

Brakes on a plane, brakes on a train
Breaks to make you go insane
Breaks in love, breaks in war
But we got the breaks to get you on the floor
And these are the breaks
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
Break down! Yo!

Just do it, just do it, just do it, do it, do it!

You say last week you met the perfect guy
(That's the breaks, that's the breaks!)
And he promised you the stars in the sky
He said his Cadillac was gold
But he didn't say it was 10 years old
He took you out to the Red Coach grill
But he forgot the cash and you paid the bill
And he told you the story of his life
But he forgot the part about...his wife! Huh! Huh!
Well, these are the breaks!
Break it up, break it up, break it up!
Break down!

While you home all alone, I'm blowin up in em
Sendin them back to you, mad at you
Don't catch a motherfuckin attitude

You're fuckin wit King Papi Chulo when knockin culo
Pop your mulos out the socket tryin to ride with the sumo
You know my rise is high, word I be drillin em
Bitches be tryin to ride but the current be killin em

Bumpin and grindin simultaneously grindin
Climbin up the walls, with my balls, bangin off your hymen
I'm a diamond in the rough (UHH) bustin in your face
Taste the sweetness of my dick, rip your fetus out of place, yo
Bitches already know the repertiore
Step in my car, lets start the menage-a-trois, like Escobar
By far, I'm the best at all sex positions
Forget the kissin, I'm skippin the tongue twistin, TS Tradition

Some chick in back of me bought me a daiquiri
Told me meet her in back of Zachary's
Cause she heard I was packin meat
I bagged the freak and hit the tele'
Got the Phillies, lifted her belly
And ""Put it in Her Mouth,"" like Akinyele
Far from ugly but they used to say I'm too chubby
But since the money the honies got nuttin but love for me
So rub my tummy and make a wish, I'll make you rich
Take your kids to the flicks
Come back and fix your favorite dish, NOT!!!!
You crazy bitch, I ain't with that, I'mm hit that
Split back to the shack where my other chicks at
Now can you dig that?? I'm the Mack, doin my thing
Pullin your strings, makin you feel like you in a dream
It's the king of the Hip-Hop Quotables, givin you multiples
Just by the tone of my voice in the vocal booth
I notice you doin your thing with your crew
Is it aight if I come down there and sing to you?

Pull up on the block bumpin' it first (Word)
Makin' ya whole hood feel me like grill
And have your whole city high ride like George Steel
Fool you want the funk, we can bring it to the stage
Face off like John Travolta and Nicolas Cage
A lot of rappers claim east Oakland and it ain't from it
Put them lyrically toe to toe to me and see who really run it
And we haven't even gotta talk about the production tip cause on the real
None of them gonna quit (showdown)
To handle my caliber this next level style combined with rhyme
Groups wanna need a click why don't they come to mine

It's hot and hazy, never shady, you must be crazy
It's ridiculous how you put your lips on this
Don't kiss right there girlfriend I'm ticklish
And I be switching fees with a wrist full of G's
Nigga please, I'm the macaroni with the cheese

[Refrain: Notorious B.I.G.]
Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded
I don't know why they hate us
Is it our ladies or our drop Mercedes
Baby, baby

[Verse 3: Puff Daddy and Mase]
Now Puff rule the world even though I'm young
I make it my biz to see that all ladies cum
Get em all strung from the tip of my tongue
Lick em places niggas wouldn't dare put they faces
Before I die, hope I, remake a flow by
In the brand new treasure on a old try
Now when my throat dry, even when the smoke lie
Eat the Mami chocha and drive her loca
We never ride far, packed five in a car
Save money for the drinks
I'm about to buy the bar
And everywhere I drive I'm a star
Little kids all on the corner scream, that's my car
It was days couldn't be fly, now I'm in a T.I
Come in clubs with B.I., now a nigga V.I
Rock tons of gold, nuff money I fold
Roll the way you wanna roll, break a hundred at the toll

[Refrain: Notorious B.I.G.]
Been around the world and I I I
And we been playa hated
I don't know and I don't know why
Why they want us faded

(Talking) Back again...It's the jankiest the jankiest
Still gettin' my stalk on walk on

[Verse 1: W.C]
One of the G'est WSC riders
One about the Feds on camera with the folded bandanna
It's me the D- U- B- C Nighttrain sipper
Two fingers split I'mma get her once again I bring her
Skip skip throw it up throw it up give it up or get rolled up
Swole up thought I told ya 'bout this Maad Circle Soldier
Allstars locs pieces khakis and linens
The OG Godfather with the blue feather in it
The shadiest nigga what's crackin' who got the sack and
Nigga what they goin' for everybody's on the floor
Make way for the loccest cutthroat with a beard long as Moses
Walkin' through yo camps and striking penitentiary poses
A straight vet Connect Gang is my set
Since a rook I did everything in the book
Puttin' those thangs on ya like bing bing when I get ya
Loc this rap game ain't ready for a real cap nigga

[Hook 2x]
Not just clownin' we got thousands
Still out bangin' the streets
Playas get jacked from thinkin' I'm acting
Y'all can't see WC..

[Verse 2: W.C]
Now bow to the shadiest hood patrollin' west rollin'
7 figure nigga still hi fi growin'
Pistol holdin' bailin' with nothing but trues
Jumping out the fo' in the corduroy house shoes
WC a G been in these streets for years
Been loccin' since the Force MD's were singing ""Tears""
Now what the fuck a new nigga got to say to me
I was pullin' 211's when KDAY was the Beat
1984 Lo Cali Sports Arena
At Uncle Jamms Army jackin' fools for Filas
When Run DMC and Jam Master first bust
We was snatchin' mothafuckas outta Nissan trucks
Raised from a crew of real killers and knick kickers
That never ran on ya but was quick to put them hands on ya
(Talking) Ha ha Man y'all better figure us out quick
Ain't no rappers here we felons trying to make money at this here

[Hook]

[Verse 3: W.C]
It's the cap peeler night grinder west rider hood ratacider
Deuce 4 7 all day everyday
4 deep hittin' corners in a rag Chevrolet
Started out minor before I turned major, used to do it for free
But now I ride for the paper
Maad Circle hit 'em up like bam
Where y'all from them enemies don't act dumb
Y'all know where we from
It's that 15th letter 2 times with the S
Cut off Dickie wearing descendant from the West
Steady square dumping in the center where the crowd
With my flag on my head tied Aunt Jemima style
But ain't nobody trippin' cause we all about the ends
Plus fool I don't set trip I set trends
Now after this I'm givin' y'all about a year
We gone see how many niggas grow braids in they beard

[Redman] I'm gonna Bankhead bounce

[Redman] Aiyyo, one two three four five six seven, blaze the hot
[LL Cool J] Trizack that sound like heaven
Seven six five four three two one
C'mon, Meth-Tical, come and get some

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Playing my position, hot Nick, son
This one, for all the sick ones, infliction
Poisonous darts sickening, best believe
Finger itchin' with two broke legs, now I'm trippin'
On MC's cliche, shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D, no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly
Tap your jaw from my Punch Buggy sunning you
Got you shittin' in your last Huggie, running who
Fuckin' punk, get a speed bump coming through
A single shot make yo meat lump, respect Wu

[Verse 2: Redman]
Aiyo I put it on a nigga, shitted on a nigga
Turn a Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got sent up I was hitting your ex ho
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobblin'
Shit I'm driving in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the gypsy
When I approach rappers be taking notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolute, I love to burn to the roots
I keep comin' til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic

[Verse 3: Canibus]
I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown with ya head still attached to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beating niggas to death and beating dead niggas to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
If the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
Like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?""
I think I'll go on for more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run to, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild?
Who wanna act fly and get shot down with a surface-to-air missile?
I take em on in all shapes, sizes, and forms, and spit on
Anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin' a hundred when I'm blunted
And I give it to any nigga that want it

[Verse 4: DMX]
Stay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you, dog, believe that
Where we at, do you value your life, as much as your possessions
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give
Than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put you somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on
You ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
So I can hit you up on Front Street, you think I'm sweet
Want heat, one deep, leave him behind, front seat

[Hook: Redman]
Aiyyo, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Blaze the hot trizack, shine like heaven
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
Come on Mr. Smith, come get some

[Verse 5: LL Cool J]
When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
Tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords, I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewhere cryin on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
With one thesis (""LL Cool J is hard"")
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
And try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like picking up a ball, playing with Mike
Swingin at Ken Griffey or challenging Roy to a fight
Snapping, you amateur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team touring overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringing a tiger cub to his knees
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize
And you don't wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socialize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
To play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line

Buck wild for all of my people who don't care
Lost like a bunch of black millionaires
Makin ya run, me and my gun
Stackin my ones
Floss a little, invest up in a mutual fund
Blowin the horn since of everyday I was born
Never dreamed I’d see a nigga landscaping my lawn
Dangerous, my niggas shit be accurate
Have to get, the flow be so immaculate
A yo a yo I do my deal sippin my moet
Sippin' it slow, them pretty bitches sayin hello
Any wiggle hittin this playa, Oil of Olay
Little honey dipped in within her little cabriolet
I don't mean to hold you up
But I got somethin to say
Swear to only give you hot shit everyday
Afraid of us, you know this ain't no game to us

Back in the days brother use to be assed out
Now a brother holdin several money market accounts
Blaze the street and then I would just like to announce

I'll catch up with you soon, holmes
Haha, yeah, we'll catch up to you all, all of you mothafuckas
You know what I'm saying
Cause at the end, at the end we all diiiie

[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
Sounds like Gods are crying tears of Malathion
Raining over your head to put out the fire
Who desires to die? besides the suicidal
Tendencies can lead to the eternal sleep
So keep you eyes wide, open and alive
Grab your snake and ride to the other side
If your intention is to defy death
I'll tell you now, even the best get laid to rest
We're on our way to the Stone Garden
End of the road where everybody goes but not forgotten
Frames all rotten, souls travel to unravel
Other worlds and big cloud castles
Why do we have these hassles, livin' cautious?
Walking the street, watching your back
Your fear's collosus
We conjure souls while ganja rolls
Everybody here's high so the story unfolds
We're on another plane of thought, thinkin' immortal
But the path we're on leads us straight to the portal

[Hook: Big Duke & Sick Jacken]
(Devils in disguise)
They're coming to claim us
Let it come as no surprise
I stare into the face of death
Cause at the end of their time, everybody dies

This is the time of pain
Warzone for your own gain
I roam the middle with the metal cause I'm insane
Break frames, catch a smokin'
Is it gonna earn you a name?
Did you get slain?
Or fall victim to bald knuckle heads and bad aim
It ends all the same
Every mothafucka right here gotta jump a soul train
Some go up, some go south
Some get stuck in a realm with no way out
Some get to ride, O.D. on drug hits
Dying in your sleep, that's the shit
But lives get took violently on the streets of a lost city

[Hook: Big Duke (x2)]

[Verse 3: B-Real]
In the Stone Garden, we keep all the heavenly gates packed
With fresh souls under control, no holdin' back
Look at all these names engraved in the stones
Even the unknown finds his path on his way home
Roam where the spirits all lie
One of these fuckin' days, even I'm gonna die
And when I do, I'll be another memory
Hangin' out with the ones who were there before me
Look out, let me set your soul free
By the Buddha tree, open the gates to eternity
Everybody rise up, open up your eyes
We demise and we're trippin' to the other side

[Hook: B-Real (x2)]

[Outro: Big Duke]
Yeah at the end, at the end we'll catch up with you
You know what I'm saying, ese
We all die then mothafucka
Yeah, even if you take me out right now
One of my mothafuckas gonna take you out
And then you'll take him and back and forth and shit
And it don't stop, you know what I'm saying?
Body rot, drop and shit
You know what I mean, haha

It's like Romeo and Juliet
Hot sex on a platta' just to get you wet
You's about to get in somthin' you will never regret
And it's gonna be the bomb this is what I bet
Yep!

Since the first time I saw ya
I knew I was attracted
Reacted to the fact
On how ya make me act
Shy but sexy at the same time
Always on my mind was a little bump and grind

Usually I don't play it that close
You got's to kick it wit me
Before I serve you up
With an overdose
Of that bomb-ass puh-nanny
Make you my man
I ain't got no love
For nobody else but you

Cuz you's my boo
I prove to you
My love be true
So do you know where you goin' to
Through thick and thin, baby
You all in, time will reveal
That my love for you will never end

My heart keep tickin'
No time for trickin'
You who I'm pickin'
So lay me down
Just give it a good lickin'
I'll treat you like my king
Cuz you royal
And only give my love to you
Because I'm loyal, escape with me

Come over to my place
I'll teach you a few things in love makin'
Now I can't wait, I won't wait
So take me by my arms and rock me baby
Cuz I'mma always and forever be yo lady

Repeat 1

After our first night
You discovered who's the bombest mommy
L.A.'s finest with my top dogs all around me
Down to ride, harder than Bonnie and Clyde
We're sexual healers, do ya feel this
Baby, check my vibe

They'll never be a love like me
That got your back in this industry
That got your back in these streets
So you don't have to worry 'bout me
On the creep
And I don't want you ever to try to
Play me cheap

Cuz I don't sleep around
Because it's sleezy
Good lesson taught by my big homey E-Z
I got to compliment you on how you please me
Touch me, but don't tease me
Now put it in nice and easy

And rub my body down I'm feeling wheezy
And cuddle up to me
Cuz now I'm getting sleepy
But I'mma be dedicated
To this relation
So stay away from all them cowboys
So we can not be playa hated

Cuz if you wit me boo, then keep it real
And if I catch you sleepin' around
Then I'm gon' have to chill
When ya find good love
You best to keep it
I'm puttin' all my sista's up on game
So whyn't cha' peep it

Cause they deserve it; when money got murdered

The nigga ain't blew up the spot a while
And the mother fucker ain't got shot in a while
It just takes a light up to fuck the night up
Blow everything in sight up, fuck around and I'll have your ass right up
When you mention some shit you wasn't able to stand
I got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of a hand
The days are longer and seems like I'm facing time
I've got a lot of dreams but I'm not really chasing mine
I soak it all up like a sitting fly
Cause nowadays getting by, nothing more than an occasional meal and getting high
I live to die, That's where I'm headed
Let your man hold something, now it's all about you can get it

And I bet you wish you never got hit cause you be walking
But shit happens and fuck it, you done did your dirt
Niggas is wondering how the fuck you hid your skirt
Right under their eyes like a surprise to the guys
That one of their mans was a bitch in disguise
Fucking with cats that order more hits and slaughter more kids
Let me holla at you yo Baltimore shit (ah-oh!)
Knahmean? I'm just robbing to eat
And there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbing the street
When we're starving, we eat whatever's there
Come on you know the code in the street; whatever's fair
Blood stains and chalk, menas your man couldn't walk
After the talk, about him not being 11-33 to New York
Transforming-ass niggas'll get it quick
And yo for real that nigga K can suck my dick
And it's gon' take all these niggas in the rap game to barely move me
Cause when I blow shit up, I have niggas falling like white bitches in a scary movie
AHHH! You know I don't know how to act
Get too close to niggas it's like: ""Protected by Viper, stand back""

I'm taking you back
I'm taking you back
Here's another one

[Queen Pen]
Uh, yeah
I remember being on that nigga's chair, hard
Back in the day in the projects
Chasing after him, a lil' young chick
Seeing him made me go back in my lab
And write this lil' shit like this
Check it out

Here's how it goes
Used to see you when I went to the store
Always watch you play ball from my bedroom window
The places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with
The spot in the grass where you kept your stash

I used to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes
If you ever noticed me and knew I was alive
I tried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs
With hopes to get close to you

Used to dream about you right before I went to sleep
Used to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets
Used to practice what I'd say for the day that we meet
Used to pray every day for the day that we meet

Used to hang with your sis if she only knew
I only hung with that bitch to get closer to you
Wasn't no limit to the things I would do
To give all my love to you, my God

[Eric]
Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night
I don't love you
You're at the top of my list
Cuz I'm always thinking of you
(Take it to the bridge)

All my love
(Cuz all my love's to you, my girl)
A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough
(Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one)
I just don't wanna stop
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much
(Yeah, uh huh, yeah, Queen Pen take it to the Brooklyn Bridge)

[Queen Pen]
Stop being by yourself, now you hung with the crew
I took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew
Me and my friends, all virgins, all learning
How to tow that shit, how to throw that shit

Talked about that sex like I was used to it
Lying about how many you used to kiss
In the hallways, all day, 'till it was real
In the staircase, lights out, giving out feels

Put your name in my notebook, we all did that
Lined our names up with numbers to see if they matched
Scared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt
In your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work

Dead wrong, but head strong, ya had in this broad
The only one I ever loved ever since I was young
Once in a while I even cut school to give all my love to you
My God

[Eric]
Can't feel myself
Don't want nobody else to ever love you
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night
I don't love you
You're at the top of my list
Cuz I'm always thinking of you
(take it to the bridge)
All my love
(Cuz all my love's to you, my girl)
A thousand kisses from you and it wasn't enough
(Right, I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back, with another one)
I just don't wanna stop
Too much, never too much, never too much, never too much

The breakdown, now bounce to this
Yeah, dedicated to the first love (right)
Uh, you know who you are, from the hood
It's all good (yeah) yeah
We gon' bounce ta dis

Now bounce

You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha

[Verse 1: 2pac]
I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin', I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love

You tried everything, but you don't give up
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up

[Verse 3: 2pac]
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love

Gun rest under your vest by the abdominal
Rhyme a few bars so I can buy a few cars
And I kick a few flows so I can pimp a few hoes
Excellence is my presence, never tense
Never hesitant, leave a nigga bent real quick
Real sick, raw nights, I perform like Mike

And I'm, quick to bust, if my ends you touch
Kids or girl you touch, in this world I clutch

Now you call me Castro, my rap flows

Put your money on the table and get your math on
Break it down, split it up, get your laugh on
See you later Dog, I'mma get my stash on
There's a bed full of money that I get my ass on
I never lose the passion to go platinum
Said I'd live it up 'til all the cash gone
Ain't that funny, only use plastic, craft it
To make classics, hotter than acid
P-D, rollin on your tape or CD
The Billboard killa, no team illa
The Fam-o, ammo, is every channel
We been hot for a long time burnin like a candle
What you can do is check your distribution
My songs bump in Houston like Scarface produced 'em
You ain't gotta like me, you just mad
Cause I tell it how it is, and you tell it how it might be

We got the shit mapped tight, brass knuckles and flashlights

Matty broke the neck of your coke connect
No respect squeeze off 'til all y'all diminish
Shootouts for twenty minutes, until we finish
Then it's to the loot, escaped, in the Coupe
Break bread, with the 'Kiss, Peniro, Sheek Louch'
Black Rob joined the Mob, it ain't no replacin him
Niggas step up, we just macin them, placin' them
In funerals, criminals turn the vials
To Brick City, nobody come off like P. Diddy

People always talking 'bout (Huh what, say what)
You're a hustler (Huh what, say what)
I don't care what the others think (Huh, what, say what)
Just be straight with me (Huh what, say what)
Ooh, ooooohhhhh (Huh what, say what)

[Verse 1: Silkk the Shocker]
Huh, huh, huh
I know I take chances to make sure I'm sittin' tight
Do I get it how I live it but sometimes I don't get it right
Now gold and platinum plaques, man you know what we did
Have the whole world up on Silkk the Shocker and Master P hits
See it ain't No Limit, it's only the beginning
Watch us ball y'all want us to fall to the wall, huh gon' be a minute
And see I get the rhymes written with Beats By the Pound shit
It sounds sick, Rolex with baguettes all around it
Now take us out the ghetto and live up on top
Takin' flights and shoppin' sprees, hop on forty foot yachts
See money don't change me, make me live a lil' bit good
Took some of my family members and homies out the hood
See we ghetto millionaires far away when we meet
I think they watch us P, cover our mouth when we speak
See I'm  too deep to change, everybody know my name
I guess I gotta charge it to the game

[Chorus - Destiny's Child] + (Master P)

[Verse 2: Master P]
Ugh! Green money, I like to count hundreds
My only bad habit that I like to sell the bees honey
We hot, check the Billboard spot
Twenty-fourt G's, the piece to make the club rock
Bout it bout it, gotta get 'em rowdy
Peep game, got a Benz, Lex, Luger, and an Audi
Don't hate me, the money don't make me
It's gonna take two hundred million just to break me
Cuz I'm a soldier, I thought I told ya
I like that doja but hate the rollers
Cristal, green and Hennessey
Got three maids, a butler, and a Bentley
From the ghetto, ain't No Limit cuz we livin' large
Bought a Rolex, a yacht with a gold card
You done hate me, ya girl wanna date me
Give her three or four ughs and I'm straight G

[Chorus - Destiny's Child] + (Master P)

[Verse 3 - Silkk the Shocker]
I guess they call me a hustler cuz of the fast livin'
But if I see something I gotta get it because I have vision
And if I like it, gotta get it, if I saw it
Went from opening shows, opening doors
House full of floors that's marble
A brand new Ferrari, parked it when I bought it
See I'm a No Limit soldier I came to get it started
What ya, what ya think I'm all about my bank
Tryin' to be a multi-million before I'm old enough to drank
Now we can ride bro, no lie bro
See nobody be here besides us so go 'head and fire it up
Some girls like to twerk it, my homies like to work it
Soldiers from Texas all the way to Jersey
Tick to the tock, all around the clock
From the north to the south to the east to the west it just don't stop
So to all my real G's throw 'em up high
To all the ballers twist corks of Cristal, fly

Meet me at the crib bout 2, stop frontin
Blow to the bone as I clicked on somethin
Tryin to cut me up, yeah the trick's on somethin
The corner of the party where the niggas stay bumpin
This is for the gin and the hen in my stomach
I'm lookin at the do' females still comin
Lookin to my left and the B's still comin
Lookin to my right and the drinks still comin
Tryin to shake the dice but the girl lookin cunnin
Circlin the do' where the money start runnin

Hey Hummers in the double-R, is it a double car

Lean back in the corner with the Dobbe hat
Now my nature is to ball like a democrat
In the club with hoes, and I suppose

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm - got it down pat
You call her what you want or even all that
I been taught by the best, so put it to rest
And I confess, I'm here just to ball black
Gettin paid in the game bend a row free
Flip a penny to a dime I'm like an O-G
Go to the mall, with all of y'all
Show you some cash, now, tell me what you want B
You can ride or just smoke in the Cadillac
AC, windows down, with the top back
From a Caddy to Lex' to Rolex
I'm a put in a roll, tell me could you top that?
Ever though I'm makin money in a row friend

Take a stroll through the hood
It's some haters but it's still all good
Roll up another backwood, playa pimpin to the groove
In the place to be to see who I can choose
Now it's time for me to make a move
Shotry what's the lead?

Stick a phrase while I trades on my hog road
Devine words form the pimp scroll
Get the bitch if I'm walkin and she peepin that my limp's cold
See a playa po' trippin, pimpin's the method

Go in your bathroom turn the light out, scream
Bloody Mary, 1, 2, 3
Sheek ain't your usual friend
About to set you up like Keyser and walk straight at the end
I'm done wit' ice and charms
I'm tryin' to ice my whole castle 'fore I'm gone
Pull up wit' glass on the don'
Once I meet em' I greet em'
Kiss his feet for freedom
Tell em' thank you lord
Cuz on Earth I was gettin' bored
Now resurrect me back to this cat called Sheek
So I can make this album
And get back the cats that's weak
Two-thirty, six two
Me versus you that's like a cat versus a pitbull
Gun, know clip full, keep hunger
And plan for the future, cause you figure
You gon' be older
Way longer than you gon' be younger

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Only time could tell how the clock ticks
I'm really loved here but I'm still a hostage
Two personalities check the posture
Smoke out the mouth clear out the nostrils
Think of death
The life seem scary
I'm passin' graveyards seein' people Hail Mary
I ain't chillin til' I'm out parachutin'
Race my man in mountain climbin' for about ten diamonds
Twenty five thousand a piece
Fuck streets
Tryin' to own the island, forget about wylin'
Try ridin' in the car that be glidin'
If I showed you where I lived you would think I was hidin'
Sling dick to chicks that don't speak English
Wake up in Trinidad, like fuck it I'm rich
Come back, private jet
Live on set, if you can shit gold, I can spit baguettes

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yo nothin' but the hotness
Whenever we drop this
Monotonous for ya'll to keep hatin'
Cause ya'll never gon' stop us
I keep my rocks spotless
And my hoes topless
Take time try to figure out who da Lox is
Fear no one
Kick rhymes like Shoguns
You scared to blow one
Get robbed wit' your own gun
If I don't respect you I'mma check you
And if I don't kiss you I'mma peck you
Right before I wet you
I sneeze on tracks an' bless you
I'm special
And if you like workin' out
Then I'm gon' stretch you
Husslin' is dead but we still get red
Turn the spots into bakeries to get back bread
And ya'll said my money's spent
But it's in the Bent'
So when the Feds come, the dogs can't get a scent
For my story, self-explanatory
That I'm the hottest thing on the street
And yall ain't got nothin' for me

This is a beat that I can freak to
Just drop the reals
Plus a nigga wit' the ill

X 'em on the grill get em' up
Split em' up, wet em' up
And watch em' come get em' up
Set em' up
When you do dirt, you get dirt
Bitch, I'll make your shit hurt
Step back like 'I did work'
This ain't no fuckin' game
What'chu think I'm playin', till you layin'
In the car in the junkyard decayin'
Mom's at home prayin' that you comin' home
But you not, cause you sittin' up in the trunk
Startin' to rot
And hell is hot, I know because I'm here now Baby
It's goin' down baby

I don't discriminate, I regulate every shade of the ass
Long as you show class and pass my test
Fat ass and breasts, highly intelligent bachelorettes
That's the best, I won't settle for less
I want a ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
I lay your head on my chest, and feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep
Pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty, round, brown ho wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional, I'ma let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, ‘cause you got to go
I could go downstairs, little brown hairs everywhere
You nasty, Twin; I don't care
'Round here they call me Big Pun, if you with the big guns
Thick tongue, known to make the chicks come

[Outro x2: Big Pun & Joe]
In the hot tub, poppin' bubbly
Rubbing your spot love, got you screaming, ""Punish me!""
But it don't stop, watch the Pun get wicked
When I stick it even Luke be like, ""Don't stop, get it, get it!""

[Hook]

[Outro: Joe]
Boricua, morena (x6)
No more rollin' with an entourage
Unless it’s Pun and the Terror Squad
Punisher, Punisher, Punisher
Big Punisher, Punisher, Big Punisher

Coming from afar
Reaching for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh-huh
From one corner to another, uh-huh

[Verse 1 : Pras]
Some got hopes and dreams
We got ways and means
The supreme dream team always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to selling raps, name your theme
My rise to the top floating on this cream
Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million ReFugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top skeezers
Diplomatic legalese; no time for a Visa
They just begun, I'mma shoot them one-by-one
Got five sides to me, something like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Letting bygones be bygones, and so on, and so on
I'mma teach this cat how to live in the ghetto
Keeping it retrospective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
P-P-Politic with ghetto senators on the D-low

One, two
And you don't stop
Yo!
My eyes is sore, being a senator
Behind closed doors hitting truth to the seafloor
The rich go North, ignore the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores
So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself walking the streets
Trying to find what's really going on in the streets

[Pras]
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay
Stretch my heater make you do a pot of beret
Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doing ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yelling ""Ole!""
Who the hell wanna save me, from B.K. to Cali

Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is losing fast in the horse race
2-faced, getting defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screwface

[ODB]
Well I'm paranoid at the things I say
Wondering what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hanging out
Partying with girls that never die, you see I was
Picking on the small fries, my campaign telling lies
Was just spreading my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holding the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
It's all together now in the hood

When it get cold, that ice that you can't see?
See that shit happens sometimes
Yep, black ice

Now you know and I know I done bumped every hole in the wall y'all
Did you catch that phone call most of y'all didn't met me
Thought I was tall, Get flipped like a dip
Slipped fell on da black ice
Did you think twice, homeslice came and he went satisfied
Got bent bars ain't shit
Meetin' coast to coast yeah lamped & bo man do-si-dos
Too many coming close cuz

Touched what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high

Circulate like a Sunday paper
Capers caught tony tone with cheap flicks
Good picks pay hard watch the hard turn sideways
Clip the tale for real sales to the who lose cash
Flesh Live your life for now

Feeling good and warm windows rolled tight
Thirty five degrees nippy tonight, don't forget the chapstick
Lips dry quick when the jack out make you wanna act out
Take the slack out some people black out
Hibernating to a cave backout

Touched what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high
Touched what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high

I been in it for the past few days
Tighter than fades I know all my plays now can I rap? can I adapt?
Now really sure yeah who's that looking over the shoulders
Of those writing dreams
Feening for the taste of menthol missed class stayed in the hall
Looking for a squeeze play better yet a holiday
Stayed away from the pyramid board game
Broke it down to a neighborhood slang, cash before fame

Sky high, sky high, sky high (sky high)

Now who done stepped in? the nigga the b-i-g the secret weapon boy
Slicker that black ice throwing them flows like rice at weddings
So quick flexing, you speaking about sankin that's refreshing to the earlobes
Pay for the room and still be in pimp mode

Like icebergs, chryslers and buicks
Some niggas ain't on their jobs so them suckers tend to lose it
Abuse their priveliges and now the whole village is been shot to pieces
'Cause niggas are biting that same stupid shit I mean that feces

Boy don't beat me if you ain't got no work
I'm strictly about these verses like the ones you hear at church boy
Seach boy, talking about your dough is punk like lurch boy
Every time I heard your rhyming like a fucking jerk boy, simp, yeah!

Friends, Romans, countrymen lend me you eardrums
It was a beautiful day off in the neighborhood
Yellows and greens and blues and browns
And greys and hues that ooze beneath dilapidated wood

Ain't a thing could explain but what pertains
To cocaine & sustaining rain
See summer roll around niggas all about change
Then they steady move them keys like bob james

'Cause old man winter's arrived, the temperature dives
November just died, December's alive
Thus it ain't no typical ride
Just individuals way to bring home the bacon when bacon was all gone
Making it our own taking me all wrong

We've all indulged in the bulge of those no-nos
No you ain't solo, there's even lower levels you can go
Take sun people put them in the land of snow

Touched what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before

I mean what the fuck is it, why you stressin' me child
It'd be one thing if you were finessin' my style
But when I go to court, you know the dress of the trial
You not my wife, so if I ask head I be fowl
You better be down, the only question better be 'how'
Threaten' me now, bet me a thou, no girl deadin' me now

It's 4 pages but my name ain't Aaliyah, what?
I don't know much about biology or chemistry
Failed the SAT's, study Brooklyn Zoo-ology
Remember me, Wyclef, the memory
Ectasy with no theory of manoghany
""To be or not to be"", last words from Shakespeare
But a package says I wanna get rich with no fear
A few good men in the new millineam
Women got a new law, if you cheat you're a dead man
So I been dead like 100 times

That I'm doin' my thing, more more waiting

That he came in when you didn't want to be there
And I fell victim to this one night affair
By the time weeks came you was already there
And still I come home just looking at you
See I'm feeling kinda guilty but revengeful too
All the dirt you done done, you don't know a clue
Why I don't sex you no more, and that's not coo'

Got surprised because I saw little Shawn
In the passenger seat with a bottle of Dom
Remain calm, called Cocren on the horn
Salaam, call up the chief 'cause a murder 'bout to go on
What the bomb, bomb, but this ain't a reggea song

I should just let you live, right? Negative, I swear
It's dough or die, I hope your soul provides you with an afterlife
Close your casket tight, take your last two deep breaths
And pass the mic, to Jay-Z nigga, that's right!

[Chorus 2x:]
Who you gonna call when it's time to brawl
Standin' 'round waitin' for my queendom to fall
Well I think not, styles are pipin' hot
Blazin', amazin', I give it all I got

I'm tellin' you straight up, all sleepin' beauties better wake up
I'll tear your state up, so set the date up
And I'm a rip it, what if it what was it
Who did it, who does it
From private to public
Anywhere I'm in there and been there
So recognize this, who the nicest
Sit down and settle for your constellation prizes
Whatever you want I got
Whether you ready or not
It's about to get hot when I drop
So notes, pause another spot
To do you, don't get me in a corner make me do you
Don't try to be me, do you
Be coo' to you and do you
I'm on a higher level with different class, another plane
I am the Queen, that's my name, time to explain
That I spit game with dames
Leave 'em all with shit stains
Split frames, hopin' you hopin' that I'm jokin'
Don't know but still blink off like fo'-fo's
But so-so, slow mo's comin' in like the po-po's
Don't want rocks comin' at me the wrong way
Packin' much rocks, it's gonna be a long day
And for real, spittin' on imbessiles and spinnin' wheels
On my 600 you want it, you must be blunted
I'll take it to your stomach, run it, give me all
Mic for mic, steppin' to me you gonna fall, we brawl
Throwin' a two-piece so loose leafs
It's the Q-U-double-E-N
You know how I'm MCin'

[Chorus 2x]
See physically you not ready
Lyrically you not ready
Mentally maybe
Who talks tough, time to get the baby
No threats or small bets on my bond we can get it on
From dusk 'til dawn from night 'til mourn
Some bubble hard squads are gone, no gimmicks, no tricks
'til one of us admits it's a battle a whisk
So look I'm off the hook, while you off the rocker
Thinkin' I'm shook, get the phone book, call the doctor
Are you out of your mind, doubtin' mines, out of line
Talkin' out your behind, shoutin' rhymes out of time
It's all over, what's up, yeah, what, what now, you tough now
Now you hush, hush now, ain't sayin' too much now
Thought so, haunt yo' sleepin' ass, creepin' fast
Like you was doin' somethin', now I gotta ruin somethin'
You image, your career, lookie here you whole life is hangin' in the air
Like a chandilier, poppin' off like a can of beer, understand is it clear
If not let me put it in your ear that I'm royalty
Even though I'm low-key, you know me
You be singin' over my tracks like it's kareoke
If you don't know the half you gon' feel the wrath
Represent the rugged path, the Flavor Unit staff
Droppin' math'matics, layin' you out like craftmatic
I'll let you have it, so you don't want the static

RIP homie, RIP

[Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick]
How do I say goodbye to what we had
The good times that made us that outweighed the bad
I thought we'd get to see forever
But forever's gone away
It's so hard to say goodbye to my homies

[Master P]
Yall need to smile for my ghetto heroes nigga

So many homies gone, trying to ball till they fall
Now I'm left with nothing but old cards
And a bunch of pictures on the wall
RIP tatoos nigga, just to show you that we real
But I still can't believe that your dead fool, and how you got killed
And on your birthday me and my boys visit your grave
And I remember when you first got high
And the first time you got laid
And I'm going through a thing, Kevin nigga, what should I do
I never imagined living life without a nigga like you

[Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick]
Chorus
Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies
Cause it's so hard to say goodbye to my homies

[Master P]
We shed so many ghetto tears, see time is crazy
And every sunday grandma go to church
She said she gotta pray for her baby
And ah, your little son, he look just like you
And momma going through a thang, but she gonna pull it through
And ah, me, C and Silkk, we got all the money but that don't mean shit
Cause I burn all that shit up nigga, just to have you again
And it's real out here, all you niggas that's goin through some pain
Keep your head up, and this for everybody
That lost a relative in the street game

[Sons of Funk/Mo B. Dick]
Chorus

[Silkk The Shocker]
Now look, I couldn't imagine life without you
I just sit here wonderin why
But the law of life, and god placed us here
And said everybody must die
Ain't it hard trying to move on, but still I try
Even though we got money, judgement day
Just some things we can't buy
Even though you gone, I never let you move on
Cause every time i think about you
I sit back and write your name in a song
Now ashes to ashes, and dust to dirt
It's kinda spooky when I see your face on a t-shirt
I just pray to god it's hard wishing it would get better
And watch it, cause death or funerals bring our family together
Now look, we done lost a brother, your son done lost a father
Life ain't promised us so tell somebody you love them
You'll never know when they'll be here tommorow

[Intro: Mos Def]
Looooord... Lord have mercy
All nice and decent crew, follow me now, we say
Say Hi-Tek, yes, you're ruling hip-hop
Say J. Rawls, yes, you're ruling hip-hop
Redefinition say you're ruling hip-hop
Say Black Star come to rock it non

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Yo, from the first to the last of it, delivery is passionate
The whole and not the half of it, forecast and aftermath of it
Projectile that them blasted with, accurate assassin shit
Me and Kweli close like Bethlehem and Nazareth
After this you be pressing rewind on top your master disk
Shining like an asterisk for all those that be gathering
Connecting like a roundhouse from the townhouse to the tenements
Cause all my Brooklyn residents, known as heavy regiments
Don't believe, here the evidence, where Brooklyn? (Whoa)
See that? Bound to take it all kid, believe that
From where they sell they tree at, to where the police be at
Talib Kweli, e-Kweli-ty, yo, tell 'em where we be at

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Brooklyn, New York City, where they paint murals of Biggie
In cash we trust, cause it's ghetto fabulous, life look pretty
What a pity – blunts is still fifty cents, it's intense
Tree scents is dominant can't be covered with incense
My presence felt my name is Kweli from the Eternal Reflection
People thinking MC is short hand for misconception
Let me meditate, set it straight, came to the conclusion
That most of these cats is featherweight, let me demonstrate
Walking the streets is like battling, be careful with your body
You must know karate and think your soul is bulletproof like Sade
Stop actin' like a bitch already, be a visionary
And maybe you can see your name in the column of obituaries
Third grade teacher reading and talking about
""I knew he'd amount to nothing""
Neighbors like, ""He was the quiet type
Who'd have thought they was fronting?""
Talking loud like you on RCA
Get carted away with body parts and trays
What a way to start your day, yo it's like

[Hook]
One, two, three
Mos Def and Talib Kweli
We came to rock it on to the tip-top
Best alliance in hip-hop, Y-O
I said one, two, three
It's kind of dangerous to be an MC
They shot 2Pac and Biggie
Too much violence in hip-hop, Y-O

[Verse 3: Mos Def]
I said Manhattan keep on making it, Brooklyn keep on taking it
So relax we're taking it back, Red Hook where we're living at
Plenty cats be struggling not hustling and bubbling
It ain't about production and – what else we discussing?
When the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows
Striving for perfection ever since I was a snot-nose
Colossal! True original b-boy apostle
Standing on the rooftop with the Zulu Gestapo

[Verse 4: Talib Kweli]
You think you the shit
Somebody in the wings'll force you to quit
It could be your crew or clique
Or some random kid you smoked buddha with
Consider me the entity within the industry without a history
Of spitting the epitome of stupidity
Living my life, expressing my liberty, it gotta be done properly
My name is in the middle of equality
People follow me, and other cats they hear 'em flow
And assume I'm the real one with lyrics like I'm Cyrano

[Verse 5: Mos Def]
Still sipping wishing well water, imported from Pluto
Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all the believers
In miles or kilometers, most cats, cannot proceed us
In the jungle with the leaders, we them lions, you the cheetahs
Our cypher, will complete us as we come through your receivers
You can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us
(Line for line) Good Jesus! Mos Def and Kweli just
Make a pussy freeze up; think it over, ease up

But I'm his Royal Slickness, ghetto weakness, cause  Rick is

(Uhh) Who bum from and who balls you hung from
Wouldn't give a fuck what part of the country you come from

I'm Snoop Dogg, I'm smooth and imperial
I wake up every morning to my Lucky Charms cereal
Times get drastic, yeah I'm a classic
Dogg Pound Gangsta chokin off that Boombastic

Now put my verse on the first one-beat the herds come
So be careful cause my rap will make you eat your words son
(Word to God) Scratch I? Who the hardest to match (I)
Bright rewrite your still Garbage to Patch

Haven't you heard? I'm loose, shook the Feds like The Juice
Snoop Dogg is a hundred-and-twenty-first proof
Fool usea deuce-deuce of some Genuine, Draft
I'm genuine, like Vinny's whinin all about cash
Cash, cash, so indeed I got the weed
And keep the lighter for the hash, has it
Ever been a time when you didn't have a dime
And the only way to get it was to go and do a crime?

Many underclothes hangin on the hoes
Since (Snoop, Slick Rick) crushed anyone opposed
Lot of ladies - pop Cristal, toast to all those
Like (Kid Capri) helpin to Unify both coasts

[Slick Rick]
I'm shredding your temple, none, 'head of the emperor
Washed up, gang member? Better remember
I wipe my feet upon a rapper like a doormat
I hit em -- where they sit around actin hardcore at
Thank God for the guardians - in light of this
Rappers always beg for me to show them who The Mighty is
Gats gonna limp, snaps on a kid
That always wanna start rappin (boy they're not gonna win)
And wanna dash at lethal or evil
Could a King bring style and class to black people?
Stick a whole log in and he buggin
Cause I - represent self, with my man Snoop Dogg and them
I drop a pile of semen on em
Even in a Yugo I could take they woman from em
I make the hardest chew the kewl of this
Kid Capri, know the part of peasant, who The Ruler is?

Chorus

[Snoop Dogg]
I'm twenty-six.. still in the mix
My hair gettin longer, my game gettin stronger
A nigga been on one, I thank God
Cause life in the city of stars is gettin hard
And it's odd, for a G to get a job
So I'd rather steal and rob, and mob with my squad
My homie used to bang, now we follow Farrakhan
Used to read The Source
Now all he read is the Holy Qu'ran
Time brings change and change brings time
Listen to me hit you with this gangbang rhyme
Nigga, whattup, who up, YOU up!
Doggy Dogg is on the mic
I'm here to fuck it izzzup
I give it to y'all, like you really got to have it
Dogg Pound Gangstaz, boy this shit is gettin tragic
But I'mma make me a grip and dip quick
And fuck with my nigga Kid Capri on this G shit
Dial tail and bail with my nigga Slick Rick-y
And all you niggas talkin bullshit can just miss me
Can't twist me, you fuckin paper haters
I'm dippin in my nine-eight gold Navigator
I'm dippin like a lo-lo
Bouncin, smokin ounces, fo' sho' doe

[Bounty Killer]
I saw these fools tryin to get around, tryin to let me down
And all dat, ha but I got an easier way to let dem drown
Wit these Guns of Navarrone, I shall shoot dem like Al Capone
Take dem to the zones of bones, like dat WELL
*begins chanting and rhyming*

[Prodigy]
Yo dunn, they tried to knock me down, bury me under
Big pipes soundin like thunder
Skated by the skin of my teeth, I had to put a man in his place last week
Now why you wanna come at me?
I'm the wrong nigga to approach like that, homes
Wrong nigga for threats, lone nigga wit long chrome
And we can dance till one of us drop
You score points fallin wit good formation
I'm the wrong nigga for patience, wrong one at dunn
The very last nigga you should ever blast your gun
To the floor, actin like you goin to war
Now you fucked up, here come a real rocket launcher
Flame thrower, rule wit a iron rod
That be the Ruger, y'all niggas keep tryin hard
But who the loser when you can't walk your hood at night
And you can't come outside without fear
Am I in your thoughts often? While you be walkin?
Foot soldier catch you at the store's corner
Keep me on your mind and don't slumber
Man the minute you slip wit those, that's your ass

*Bounty Killer rhymes and chants*

[Big Noyd]
M-O-B-B dunn, let's get it on dunn
Wit Bounty Killer, yo it's like this dunn
Aiyyo cock that shit, pop that shit
Squeeze off, let em know how real this is
M-O-B-B, D-double-E-P wit Bounty Killer
No other gun runners keep a round like this
From Q-U-double-E-N-S
My bomb borough, till the day of my death
Whether in shit I been in, runnin down the block
Sprayin shots wit the Lindon, listen
We all been through ac-tion, you know the last me blastin
The last man standin, pack shit long than bare wake
Neither the jake nor the snakes gon' stop it
You know the Mobb lettin off rockets
Gun burners spit like lungies, dummies
Still nuttin pop but the shells, these ain't words from hell
These are slugs, something you feel
A gun runner nigga for real nigga

[Havoc]
Yo hear my gat blow, make you spit out crack
The actual, that brand new six that you couldn't seem to whip
Empty the clip, make sure no friendly get hit
While you layin bloodied up in the six
Flee the frontline, dismantle gap and bounce
Then watch the twelve o'clock news and hear them shout you out
Plug leak, slip rug right from under your feet
You runnin the streets, you don't want no problems wit us
Everyday is like Fourth of July to us
Henny in my cup beside the gat you'll find in my clutch
Interfere wit the plan and you will get touched
Let the liquor talk for you and you will get touched
Full fledge, like Ra let em Know The Ledge
While you slippin off edge, your shorty's givin me head
Cockin em legs like guns when I'm cockin to spray
Poppin  your way, sendin shit that's hot your way

Bitches kill for would you still roll
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving
If I wasn't a eight-figga nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a baller so you can shop and tear the mall up

Nineteen-ninety-eight, damn I can't believe it
Whoever thought, throughout the drama, we'd live to see it
So many of us done lost lives to the streets
As we reminisce I'm pourin liquor for the deceased
Thinkin bout the times that I spent with many of em
Hopin that the Lord let me see the millenium
Trapped in this ghetto main, seekin better days
Fightin for my conscience, tryin to shake these wicked ways
I know it's wrong but it's hard to change
All my life, all I ever knew was hustle and game
Lookin for answers ever since I was a adolescent
Faced with rejection, early age stressin
But now ten years later with doodoo respect
I'm bustin million dollar raps and six digit checks
Showin love to my peeps and my love don't change
Here's a toast to you fakes, huh, here's to better days

[Ron Banks]
Might sound strange, but I just can't run away
I can't run, run, it might sound strange
But I just can't run away
I can't run, no, run away

[WC]
Touch a meal ticket, shake a spot for good
Never, I still got love for the neighborhood
And even though now it's infested with gunplay
On most days like Bootsy I can't stay away
Cause if I shook like y'all shook on me
Then whose gon' stay and guide the way for the lil homies?
I can't turn my head on my folks
So I stay visible in these streets and try to give hope
Born in the ghetto, raised in the ghetto
Got love for the ghetto, I can't forget the ghetto
How come everytime we get some change in our can
We run away and try to move out as far as we can?
I know that jealousy's the devil's greed but you worse
Than a devil when you turn your back on these young G's
Now feel every word that I say, hear my cry
As I struggle out of thirst and search for better days

[Ron Banks]
Might sound strange, but I just can't run away
I can't run, run, run away!
Said I just can't run away
I can't run, run, run away
No I just can't run away
I can't run, run, runnnnnn away!

[WC]
Another day another dollar, it feels good to look around
And see I'm surrounded by real riders
Childhood comrades I ran with for years
Shared the same beer and tears over the same peers
Player haters swearin that all we all G's
Off each others strength with these, regulates the same cheese
No jealousy we all family like Sister Sledge
Lace each other with game, so I can spin beer cans
Watch our kids grow together, as we get old together
Loc I mean this, let no one come in between this
Keep our business among us, behind doors and eyes closed
On those we consider as foes
Outsiders never exposed to your hustle
Plus I'm, never been one likely to trust em
No negative association, just dedication
To watch our paper sprout like this bud mutation

[Ron Banks]
Might sound strange, but I just can't run away
I can't run, run, run away!
No I just can't run away
I can't run, I can't runnnnnnn away!
No I just can't run away
I can't run run run run runnnnnn away!

You fed, you dead, see red

My nigga Lincoln help me navigate
Through this hate retaliate, it's official
I got that bomb, bomb, diddy, diddy, diddy, bomb, bomb
When I hit you
Push the issue
My ghetto dope is amazin
The bitch that's with you already know that I'm blazin
Slide the number, we can slumber, on the under
Girl no wonder, you got a ass full of thunder
The frozen tundra ain't cold enough
And baby ain't old enough
For this game I'm rollin up
De-zamn it feels good to be the Don
Straight legit, while niggas like Gotti just sit

No more fuckin with that homegrown
Hit the shit we on
The Rolleo's and the baguettes
You still fuckin with them faggots
We turn haters into maggots
Oak on the dash, but no coke on the hash
You broke ass niggas learn to mash, like me
Constantly, put the hustle down
With four or five niggas that's musclebound
Send your head to the taxidermist
Won't be satisfied, till I get my face on a thermos
You got to earn this, you can't take it
Can't fake it, got to live it, or we gots to visit
Who is it, the exquisite, Don Mega
Walkin with my entourage, I think I'm betta, makin chedda
You see me sag in my Jag, with the rag recognize the flag
You betta get back, everybody wanna do it like me
I got it made, been makin rap money since the tenth grade

Verse 3: Mr. Short Khop
I keeps a firm grip on my shit when in transit
Uncandid, it's the young bandit
Fresh out the trenches, the woodworks
City of the champion, where the hood work
In search of the rich blocks, to lick spots, and kick rocks
From shattered glass, down to pick locks
Want chips by the Glocks
You niggas scramblin for bullion
And settle for crumbs and croutons
I'm out for armored bucks and armored trucks, with armed killas
Bitch niggas get swallowed by the armadillos
Ain't no harmin me, the army full of ornery niggas you can't see
So while you pace bitches and Saturns livin janky
I hangs with niggas who got patterns on they hankies
After Ben Frankeys, with the big skull and eyes
You niggas bound and nullified
Sit back and mine stack it multiply

Whatcha Wanna Do?
And you better change your ways and start treatin me right

[Mia X]
I tried to feed you everything you needed
And if I wrote I love you in the sky, you probably wouldn't read it
Cause, you actin like it don't even matter no more
Sometimes, I feel we in a race, tryin to make it to the door
Is it that I bore you, is it someone else again?
Should we put this to an end, and maybe start again as friends
I'm tryin to be mature, but mentally, I'm so tired
And you can't even tell me why
I cry feelin stupid, used and alone
When it's four in the mornin and you still not home
Where did we go wrong, it used to be all gravy
Makin love all night, callin me your baby
But things got shady, now we ain't even close
Treat me like I should leave, and then don't want me to go
Sometimes I think I'm stuck, ?some say we goin on that path?
And then you raise me on the phone and please let you come back
Whatcha Wanna Do?

[Chorus:  Charlie Wilson]
Cause my heart is yearnin for your love
(2x)

[Mia X]
Now we been through all kinds of drama
But I'm the only other woman who loves you just as much as mama
I'm tryin to hold on, cause what we had was so deep
And in relationships, you got to take the bitter with the sweet
You keep runnin in and out, messin with my feelings
Playin with my mind and I know you see me trying
But even soldiers fall, remember when you fell
Remember the excuses and the lies I had to tell
?Put penance? for your bail, even though you gave me hell
When you was snortin more than half of what you had to sell
Put up with all your flings, hold my head, feelin sad
But through all the bull, you know it wasn't that bad
You used to make me laugh, show me love and respect
But if you don't make a change, you'll be callin me your ex
Can't keep runnin in and out
Can't keep runnin
Whatcha Wanna Do?
Whatcha Wanna Do?

Cause my heart is yearnin for your, let me inside your love
My heart is yearnin for your, let me inside your love
Whatcha Wanna Do?

Now what we gonna do?
I can't help but think of all the good times we had
When everything was so right
You know I can't pull all the weight by myself
And I feel like that's what I've been doin lately
It's a 50/50 love in a relationship, remember that
Now you runnin wild out here(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go baby)
Gamblin with all this foolishness in the streets
Whatcha gon cry about? (Mama Mia, not gonna let you go no)
You know what me and you had was real
Why you tryin to let it go?
If you wanna let it go, that's cool too(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go
Baby)
Cause I'm lookin for a Mr. DoRight
I was hopin it was you(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go no)
Cause when I first met you, that's what you was to me
Now Whatcha Wanna Do? (Mama Mia, not gonna let you go baby)
I ain't gonna keep askin you(Mama Mia, not gonna let you go no)

This song is dedicated
To all the up and coming rappers, singers, hustlers, actors

Without no struggle, you get no progress
So keep grindin, keep on mashin, get yours

You're nothin far from comin up (keep on)

So keep on grindin don't give it up (keep on)
There'll always be another day (keep on)

[Mack 10]
And now I'm sittin at the pad, teary eyed and depressed
Starvin and sufferin from mental stress
Now a true center to the game of beginner
But hard to feel like a winner when you eat spreads for dinner
Hit the streets late night in the form of star mushin
On the 211 mission just to pay tuition
For my kids I got to grind and develop street saavy
Servin stress cause I just ain't got enough to cop cavi
But I can't stop, I won't stop, til I got it made
Either build my clientele, get a job or learn a trade
Like hip-hop, and make enough to live good forever
So I learned to write the rhymes and get my metaphors together
Then I joined a rap crew, with the homies on my street
Sellin underground tapes out the local swap meet
Gettin tighter on the mic, as I worked day to day
So now I lay down at night, and I hear voices say, ""Mack""

[Chorus]

[Mack 10]
Now I'm new to the scene, H as in Hard, N as in Nympho
So like EPMD, could you _Please Listen to My Demo?_
I left the local crew, felt like I was the man
In popular demand and now ready for SoundScan
So I searched for a deal with no luck I kept rappin
Felt like it would take a miracle to make it all happen
Marble said it was a test, ""Mack don't do nuttin wrong!
Just have faith in God and keep your hustle goin strong
Stay hongry, keep writin, don't quit you're too close
Remember good things come to those who want it most""
So I never left the house, without my rap book
Thought I found a new crew but eventually got shook
First they said I was cool, but then started to doubt me
Put me on the backburner and just forgot all about me
Partna said I wasn't fresh, and sent me on my way, but you know what?
As I was leavin, I could hear voices say, ""Mack""

[Chorus]

[Mack 10]
Now the tables turned, but I remember they used to clown me
The hard work paid off, and luck finally found me
So call every publication, Billboard and the editor
And tell em Mack's being signed by dude workin on _The Predator_
I got the Midas touch, now everything be the bomb
Hooked up with The Don, now made a few mill-ion
I don't bang I write the good rhymes, you know about mines
Man I'm the tightest MC, Ice Cube ever signed
Now if ain't the radio, it's a video shoot
Livin life in the limelight, with a bank full of loot
Now my crew is solid, shook the haters and the leeches
Runnin full court at my house with our girls on the beaches
Plus the violence is ceased, no more bi-coastal beef
Cause now I get down with the North South and the East
I reminisce on hard times, seem like yesterday, but now
Hoo Bangin' is official and I remember they used to say, ""Mack""

[Chorus]

[Levert] Money's just a touch, just a simple touch
Money's just a touch away..
Money's just a touch, just a simple touch
Money's just a touch away..

But word to God I turn your last name to Underwood
Cause if I see it, I'mma take it and run with it, that's me
What type of bullshit is this nigga on? That's D
The dawg come and getcha outside
The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed
Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you
Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you
Drama, it's right here, how MUCH YOU NEED?
Beat you down with gat see how MUCH YOU BLEED
How MUCH YOU PLEAD, for your life, you was a killer
And all the bitches comin up out that ass you feelin, gettin realer
Now beg for your life, one more time, one more crime
One more nine, c'mon cry nigga
It's over! This is the shit, that hits hard
You either the last one standing, or the last one to fall

Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
Only the realest can feel us, cap-peelers and killers
Hundred-dollar billers and real niggas
Bitches with dime figures, telekenesis in my mind
Make my diamonds shine, then I blind niggas
Pussy punk perpatrators and playa haters -
They can't fade us 'cause we two of the greatest
Back out to let 'em have it, fake fucks and faggots
Bow down in the presence of players and kiss the karats
A wrist full of (?) for all the maggots
Back up and get embarrassed, bitch, get off my carriage
Uncut, no lactose, hear the raw dose
Straight off the key, 100% G
Who's puttin' it down on Miami's behalf
Home of the nickel (?) and the raw half
Everywhere we go, the impression's felt
The real is stamped on the bag and the dope is dealt

Chorus (2x):
Gat in the back, sunroof top
Real one on the scene with the gangsta lean
[The real one!  Huh?  Whut?
The real one!  Huh, nigga whut?]

Verse 2:  Ice-T
It's '98, playa, check your game
Make sure them young boys respect your name
Keep your heed at arms, reached, cocked and ready
'Cause the streets'll catch you slippin' and rock you steady
Watch your back with your homies that you feel is real
Your homeboys from your crew, yeah, they're the ones who do
Yeah, the suckas that got the playa hater venom
I wanna take 'em outside and lay slugs up in 'em
But that's trippin', and that ain't my sport
I'd rather lamp up my cirb and flip to rob a port
I sip my v-dozen on the street, bump my beats
When I'm twistin' my dub, can't nobody compete
(Imagine this) Hundred-g Lex on your wrist
(Imagine this) About 10 karats on your fist
(Imagine this) All dime hoes on your list
Huh, that shit would be nice, but your name ain't Ice
(Nigga trip) And screw the style and so on, rock you softly
How you gonna step to me, kid, you grew up off me
TV, movies and records and tours
So many buses in Versace I don't wear it no more
Called my nigga in Miami, ""Marquis, wussup?""
He said, ""Playa, chop some game on this bubblin' cut!""
I said, ""Shoot me the track, or you can come too
Or if y'all wanna ball in Cali, I'll fly in your whole Crew.""

Chorus

Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
I'ma stay in the field, on a quest for the mil's
And try to keep it real till I die or get killed
So I can sit back and kick it, write my own ticket
And live this lavish lifestyle of trickin' and big-dickin'
Seein' that the West and the South's connected
Formulatin', plottin' game to perfection
Down with the Syndicate, bossin' new tennis shit
Crimes cold defended, get caught, do the sin
There's politickin' in the 600, drunk and blunted
That's how we front it, but you don't wanna run up on it
Inside the club packin', actin'
Got my bitch at home c-sackin', got my ones stackin'
Parlay, playin' diamond link, cubin' cable
Baddest bitches in the stable, mo' money on the table
I'm back in the game to show 'em how it's done
Ice-T and Marquis, you're fuckin' with the real one!

[Krayzie]
The name is Krayzie, big bad ass bone
Wanted up north for all the gold that I stole
Along with some cash I even took the mayor's daughter
Now that there's kidnap, but she was with us so I brought her
Dun got myself into a whole heap of trouble
Double-crossed by the law so it's nobody to run to
Yeah it's just me and my sawed-off shotgun
I dun now call him 'Leatherface'
I'm headed for the west heard they got a couple banks in town
That ain't been held up yet, well uh, I ought to make it by sundown
I figure that's enough time for me to get the whole rundown
So I continue my mission, it's gettin' dark
So now I'm watching for them damn injuns
They like to catch up then they rob -n- split
I'll be a rootin' tootin' shootin' damn fool, protectin' my chips
All of a sudden, I heard somebody rumble in the bushes, stopped my horse
""Whoa nelly! Who in the bushes, you better speak up
Or I'mma let my shotgun's song sing out.""

[Thug Queen]
Who's this? Hope this ain't the law, draw out the bushes with my sawed-off shotgun

[Krayzie]
""Come on out right now I'm gettin' angry.""
Took a step back cause it could get dangerous

[Thug Queen]
""Please don't shoot it's just me Thug Queen Horse Stealer.""

[Krayzie]
""Then why the hell is you hidin' in them bushes""

[Thug Queen]
""I'm wanted in 4 counties, for armed robbery, killed 2 sheriffs, 6 of his best men with my head
Stole 2 horses, thought you was the law that's why
I jumped in the bushes.""

[Krayzie]
""Goodness.""
Now she was hotter than a barrel of fire but I could use her for the job so I told her to ride
""Come on.""

[Thug Queen]
""May I ask you what you headed to the west for?""

[Krayzie]
""I got a partner got a plan for some dough and if you're down you can pick up yourself a pretty penny
Be in town in a minute now be sure if you're with it.""

[Thug Queen]
""We be up before the sun rise got a stall(ion) here for your partner to ride hit the saloon before the moon shine down for whatever let's ride let's ride.""

[Krayzie]
""These directions say we go to Tucson, Arizona
When we arrive we'll cop a place we can bunk
And meet my boy in the morning for details -n- hookup.""

[Krayzie]
""Rise -n- shine, good morning, howdy
Nine o' clock we meet my boy in the saloon in the valley
Now I dun came a long way and I don't wanna be late

[Thug Queen]
""Tell him I'll make it to him, you know we ain't.""

Move out! Giddy up giddy up giddy up [4x]

You better count your money [2x]

[Layzie]
""I'm peepin' Krayzie's 'Wanted' poster in the saloon
So I assume it'll be trouble round here pretty soon
Glanced across the room I seen this youngster gettin' ready to fight
But if he mess up tonight I think that Krayzie just might take his life
So I approached him and I paused
""Look man, I really don't wanna brawl, but won't you chill before them laws
Come messin' up this master plan
Since he already rowdy I'm just asked the man (dang)
You want some work well partner put in your bid
And by the way now what's your name, they call me Layzie the Kid.""

[Powder Pete]
""The name's Powder Pete, can I get a 12 gauge!
Outlaw every day, on the front page
Mister Kid, if you give me the low-down me and Blackjack
Be ready for the showdown, with 2 double-barrels pointed at whatever
We'll stick together, I'm pretty clever.""

[Layzie]
""So saddle up, jump on the bandwagon because it's all goin' down.""
I heard the guy runnin' the bar screamin' 'Krayzie's in town.'

[Krayzie]
""Now when we get to this saloon, you don't worry, wait outside
Don't be stealin' nobody's damn horses.""
Stepped inside the bar
""Layzie Kid you son of a gun!""

[Layzie]
""Hey man I'm glad you made it safely, now let's go have some fun
And this my partner Powder, he's a young gun

[Powder Pete]
""Howdy.""

[Krayzie]
""Mighty glad to meet ya son
Oh yeah, you know I also brought a friend along, meet Thug Queen
The horse peddler, straggler, just met her.""

[Thug Queen]
""Howdy partner, already got the horses saddled up.""

""I hope you're good at robbin' banks like you rustle that cattle up.""

""Now y'all, it's gonna be gettin' dark real soon.""

Yo, you ever walk up into a jam right? (uh uh, Uh uh)
Know what I'm sayin', you chillin' wit' your peoples, and y'all just hangin
Out
And somebody just spill a drink on you (Oooh)
Or, a cat just squeezed your girl's booty (What!)
Or, anything could happen (Uh uh, Uh uh)
See, this is what this song is about... you know
You gotta bring it, you gotta take it there (C'mon)
You know what I'm sayin', a lot of y'all can relate to this
You know what I'm sayin' (Yeah)
But yo, I'm gon' let my homegirl tell it, you know what I'm sayin'
How she wanna take it there, you know what I mean (Uh)

Feel me...

(verse 1 - Nonchalant)
When I stepped on the scene, the skies was black with no lights
The stage was too small for all the fly mics
Wasn't nobody sayin' nothing for getting the crowd hyped
If you ain't gon' shine don't be comin' round mics
This is life, in my my life I'm living life like I got
Twenty-four hours a day, or one night
This is it y'all, I'm bout to hit y'all
The camera's on when I risidual
I bet y'all said niggas will be gone
So where you gon' be at 5'O clock i the morn'
Gettin' your lax on or gettin' your mack on
We got one mic down with the lights still on
Who want a piece of this here, ask Sean c'mon
Got that street hype, street team hype
Don't know team like my team hype, what it seem like
My movements is gettin' faster, can't see me like Casper
I'm ghost and hit this spot from coast to coast
There was cameras, so you could not miss my damage
I rip two mics in one city, single-handed
Like a bandit, coz streets was dark with no knowledge
I said my piece then I let my action relieve
I left, I saw the light shine on the street
I was back, smack-dab in the belly of the beast
I'm about to hit the clubs with this brand-new release
Who minds like bodies with the bounce of the beat
Cause when I get on, believe it it's on
Want the meaning of my words, dig deep in my song
So baby gets on, it's all mics down with the lights still on
Who want a piece of this here ask Sean c'mon

(chorus - Rampage)
Midnight, after dark, we gonna take it there
Nonchalant in the party, she gon' take it there
If you do the wrong thing, or you say the wrong thing
Ha ha, Ha ha, we gonna take it there
We gonna take it there, we gonna take it there
Midnight, after dark we gonna take it there
Nonchalant is in the party, she gon' take it there
We gonna take it there, we gonna take it there

(verse 2 - Nonchalant)
For all you foo-els, I rock jew-els
While you cop jew-els, I drop jew-els, and do it well
Really drink champagne, while you drinkin' shan-day
You tippin' bitch scales, them just tales, now listen here
Your career... fool you wanna chance your mic
So where your action, cause I can't see the light
The camera's on, the lights is dimmed, now what's your point
Took your last mic, cause you couldn't rock the joint
Feel my venom, sweatin your palms
And any MC to disagree with me, wave your arms
Now that's all mics down with the lights still on
Who want a piece of the here ask Sean c'mon
If you got what I want, then I got what you need
If the green light, then I proceed
Your to lace it, I'm not lacin' it with basics
But all I need is basics to lace it
Cause in with my facts and figures
With more broads and gold-diggers
Painting a perfect picture for my sniper to hit her
]From a rooftop, then I makaveli like 2Pac
Still I'm non-stop, makin your body rock
Keepin' this thing hot, all these on lock
To the beat, uh, and you don't stop
C'mon to the beat, uh, and you don't stop
Take it to the streets, uh, and you don't stop, c'mon

[Verse 1]
Well, go 'head and leave
The call heard 'round the world from the wives of MC's
These cats is payin' more than half a pound
My garment bag I snatch it down
Ain't got the state but we could prolly run a blacker town
Scenarios like this is tear jerkers
For the modern MC, i.e. the blue collar worker
Cause this thing called rhymin' no different from coal minin'
We both on assignment to unearth the diamond
When you start climbin'
And them eyes start shinin'
You be strugglin' and strivin'
And they think you prime-timin'
Maintain and keep silent, make note, an observation
This confrontation
This is the daily operation
My concentration
Stay focused on my recitation
'Bout to reach my destination with no pause or hesitation
Baby make the preparation cause this ain't no recreation
This is Pro Ball!
And we lettin you know y'all
At the show y'all

But God willing I'll be back home
To drop these heavy ass bags up off my backbone
Around the world with a catalog of rap songs
My baby girl is walking, been away for that long
But no you haven't well least that's how it seem to me
My home town is like a whole different scenery
The old timers on the stoop leaning leisurely
The new jacks up in the park smoking greenery
Easily taken for granted when you up in it but its sweet scented
When you been down for a minute
Move around city limits
Break it down with the vintage
The innovative
Classical B-Boy image
Collect the winnings
Cause that's the reason that we came here
This thing is not a game here
The fortune not the fame here
From New York to the Cakalaks
Cali in the Cadillacs
Chicago know we innovate
Infiltrate Virginia State
DC make me stimulate
Philly know we penetrate
Georgia make us generate
Let's set a date to get the papes
They celebrate to my jams in foreign lands
Even your mans in Japan know who I am

My name is Snoop D-O-double-G
And I'm the godfather of G-Funk
I'll put this shit down, like clown, Dogg Pound is my set
Nigga step outta line, I shoot them in they mothafuckin' spine
And break they necks (nigga, nigga)
As I go down, you gon' realize that
See when you run up in my face you able to get smacked, jacked, just
Like that

They call me Snoop D-O-double-G (na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)

Cause I'mma fuckin' fool, I can get silly
But I'd rather sit back, relax, new jacks, get smacked, cause I'm tryin'
To
Blaze up a sack (na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
To my nigga Mystikal, Fiend, and my big homie Master P
Cause thats just the way this shit gon' be
Baby, N-O-L-I-M-I-T (na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
We gon' make y'all say Woof
Until you mothafuckers demand
That nigga named Snoop

Chorus

[Verse 1: KRS One]
We hit 'em and get 'em
We stick 'em and jig 'em
We pick 'em and kick 'em
Flippin' them whip and
I'm wing clippin' them lip cause I'm cold sick of them
Much quicker than them lyrically trickin and
My tribe be on a quest like Tip and them
On every avenue puttin the full clip in 'em
Splittin' and strippin' 'em down while spittin' a round
Into them soundclash see winnin' them, just begginin' them
Get rid of every bit of them with them negative idioms
I don't even consider them
In the new millenium we killin them
Breeze Deep, Kenny and Will and them, KRS-One we thrillin' 'em
Many battles we been in them now we rebuildin them
We blaze, fulfillin them, Keith ?, Jesse, Jamil and them
We originate styles, others be stealin'them

[Verse 2: Vigilante]
You got a good rise in your rolodex, who flow is next?
Comin out to fuck with the best, put it in your chest
Inhale it and hold that, blow it out when I say let go
Let's see if you can hold your breath, by the time I flip to the next flow
This show is real, this is the deal, guns I'm running
Gotta make it out of town to flip my shit and keep it coming
Then bring it back, with another stack, of raps to blow your back out
How many of y'all wanna go for yours I keep my dogs in the crackhouse

[Verse 3: Buckshot]
Let's take a walk through Crown Heights
Steppin through the city at night
With a bunch of niggas and two mics
Form a little lynch mob, and stomp through the five boroughs
Head back to Brooklyn in the Expo
Back on the block, I see the cops everybody clockin
Buckshot, when you see the rocks, me I got you shocked
Why not? You see the recipe
Buckshot, I represent Brooklyn and my nigga Biggie

[Verse 4: Keith Murray]
I'm from C-I, L-I, F-L-Y
Where the niggas and the bitches stay paid, fly and high
Where a slut'll get mad if you call her a bitch
And a rat'll get mad if you call her a snitch
Where the rich emerge, with the niggas from the ditch
And it's a myth, they get niggas from the suburbs, that's herbs
Yo, this is for my niggas on the block all day
Who don't give a fuck waiting for crime to pay
Put your money on it, yo, we never fronted
Long Island got some of the best niggas that ever done it
From Riverhead to C.I. to Brentwood to Wyndanch
Niggas coming through will not stand a chance
From Roosevelt to Freeport to Hempstead to Uniondale
Coming deep from the depths of hell
I'm dead serious, even though you see me smilin'
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island

[Verse 5: Cam'Ron]
We destroy niggas, need advice, cause I heard em sayin Jesus Christ
You should see the sight, cookin ox-tail, peas and rice
Making about a G a night, they can't read or write
But I got every creed and type
You need a dyke, babygirl, I see the light
But sometimes y'all get crimey crimey, grimy grimy
But those with a tiny hiney they get whiny whiny
So guard your girl, Harlem World, cock the gun, pop it son
Fila fam, illa players, Killa Cam is still the man

[Verse 6: Bounty Killer]
?????????????????????

[Verse 7: Killah Priest]
Yo, hit you with the force of an iron horse
Tear your face off the planet, leaving one-third damaged
With your back cracked the Earth canvas, leavin mountains slanted
Rock the Earth off the axle, crabs who
Polar bears beneath the sea gravel
Thoughts be runnin wild like the Lil' Rascals
Puttin' dinosaurs inside of figure fours, rip you with nine inch claws
Chasing motherfuckers through malls and clash in halls
Beating motherfuckers through walls, stompin through floors
And jumpin' down elevator shafts
Searchin' for they ass, stayin' low in the grass
Wearing a gas mask, wrapping their hands up in plastic bags
On stage like a savage goin' mad
What? Yeah yeah Suuuuuuuuuuuu

[Verse 8: Prodigy]
Yeah, by all means you know you gotta put Queens on it
Put cream on it, Q.B. we rep often
Take over your party, slam dance with your hood
Took your ladies back to the projects with us
Then sent her ass back on the Q-train home
Satisfied, she learned the words to my thug song
See we one big borough of Dons with firearms
And we never use those, til the man act
Other than he's 'sposed to, nigga what I'm 'sposed to do?
Shots whistle, damn near missed that
Shoes get pissed at

[Verse 9: Redman]
From the, tip of my Timbs, to my eyebrows
The hostile, eEnglish, Olde E widemouth
Get PCP fiends, jumpin off cliffs
And if you had the balls, you'd be walkin off stiff
My paragraph alone is worth five mics (uh-huh)
A twelve song LP, that's thirty-six mics (uh-huh)
And while you win Un Hype (uh-huh) I spit on your snipe
And tell you fuck you and that bitch on your bike
Brick City

[Verse 10: Reverand Run]
Ayo, now bust it
Never try me crimey, I'm grimy, so don't deny me
I be little like your Rascals and stymie to fly that hiney
Buy me keys, to my Benz and my Coupe
Like Jay and Run and D.M.C.'s, that's the name of my group
(Now speed it up)
Beat to the rhythm of the rhyme
I'm givin up a dime, there go another line you figured
Never drivin by nine, never givin up a dime if you was
Never been that nigga
If you really wanna test me, brother don't stress me
Or you just be bowlin
It's Reverand like a Jesse, brother that's just me
And that's just my colon

[Outro: All]
The five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little niggas, show time yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets real
When the five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little niggas, show time yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets hot

You and I, 'til the day we die.. (day we die..)

Yo, yo
Ex-girlfriend, how you been? I see you still
Tryin to fuck with other women men
Remember when I first met you in my cousin's house?
A week later we was fuckin' on your mama couch
Now it's been said that big girls they don't cry
But they damn sure lie
Look you in the eye, saying you they only
You and I, til the day we die
Said you'd never leave me lonely
Fly tenderoni but you phony
Shoulda listened when my mama told me
Soon as I turn my back you try to fuck my homies
That was then, this is now, I got a new friend
Ever since I cut them loose ends you wanna bone me
Add strife to my life, pussy that'll make me think twice
About leavin' the wife even, picture that
You ain't want me when you had me
Now you on your third baby daddy
And you hate to see a nigga happy
So you tryin' mad ways to trap me
Looking at my girl nasty
Tryna throw the pussy at me

""Now look at this bitch over here tryin' to act like me""
""Uh-huh, fuck that bitch, she must like leftovers""

And used up, pull your shoes up
All you need's affection
But you're headed in the wrong direction
Tryin' to make this nigga jealous, with other fellas
All up in my face actin' overzealous
Like you want somethin' from Meth, I hope it ain't love, girl
'Cause I ain't got none left for you, plus you miserable
Misery love company, shit, I'm livin' comfortably
Don't need no nigga huntin' me down for fuckin' round
With his kitty
Talk to him, before my brother put a spark through him
Won't be pretty
The situation got my whole attitude shitty
And got you actin high saditty with your slut committee
You know I know; so go find another sucker yo
I been there and been done that befo', and don't need it no mo'
That's, my, word!
So go to your room with that there, word up
And tell that bighead nigga you run with to do the same

¡Escúchela! La ciudad respirando

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis
Shining, like, ""Who on top of this?""
People was tusslin', arguing and bustlin'
Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustlin'
I'm wrestling with words and ideas
My ears is pricked, seeking what will transmit
The scribes can apply to transcript
Yo, this ain't no time where the usual is suitable
Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable
The indisputable, we New York the narcotic
Draped in metal and fiber optics
Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips
For profits, thirsty criminals take pockets
Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches
Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of living is preposterous
Stay alive, you play or die, no options
No Batman and Robin
Can't tell between the cops and the robbers
They both partners, they all heartless with no conscience
Back streets stay darkened
Where unbeliever hearts stay hardened
My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbing
You either make a way or stay sobbin'
The shiny Apple is bruised but sweet
And if you choose to eat, you could lose your teeth
Many crews retreat, nightly news repeat
Who got shot down and locked down
Spotlight to savages, NASDAQ averages
My narrative rose to explain this existence
Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance

[Hook]
So much on my mind that I can't recline
Blastin' holes in the night 'til she bled sunshine
Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine
Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline
Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call
I can't take it, y'all, I can feel the city breathing
Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening
Sigh before we die like the last train leaving

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Breathin' in deep city breaths, sittin' on shitty steps
We stoop to new lows, Hell froze the night the city slept
The Beast crept through concrete jungles
Communicating with one another
And ghetto birds where waters fall
From the hydrants to the gutters
The Beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin'
You on the wrong side of the track, looking visibly shaken
Taken them plungers
Plunging to death that's painted by the numbers
With Krylon applied pressure; cats is playing God
By having children by a lesser baby mother, but fuck it
We played against each other like puppets
Swearing you got pull
When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes
Getting knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise
Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog
Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene
Thoughts that people put in the air
Places where you could get murdered over a glare
But everything is fair; it's a paradox we call reality
So keepin' it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality
Killers Born Naturally, like Mickey and Mallory
Not knowing the ways'll get you capped, like an NBA salary
Some cats be emceein' to illustrate what we be seein'
Hard to be a spiritual being
When shit is shaking what you believe in
For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted
I'm asking if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded
My blood pressure boiled and rose
‘Cause New York niggas acting spoiled at shows
To the winners, the spoils go
I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates
New York life type trife, the Roman Empire state

[Hook]

[Spanish speaking woman] ¡Escúchela! Respirando

[Verse 3: Common]
On The Amen corner I stood lookin' at my former hood
Felt the spirit in the wind
Knew my friend was gone for good
Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it
Mixin' down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered
I choreograph seven steps to Heaven
In Hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leaven
Veteran of a cold war; it's Chica-I-go for
What I know or what's known
So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home
From the crib I spend months gone
Sat by the window with a clutched dome
Listening to shorties cuss long
Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong
Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord
But didn't have a touch-tone
It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on
Some of this land I must own
Outta the city, they want us gone
Tearing down the 'jects creating plush homes
My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones
Surrounded by hate, yet I love home
Ask my guy how he thought travelling the world sound
Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown
It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep
Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep
Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep

Secret to keep, so keep heat incase things get deep
Peace box is where it starts, scarred flesh and broke hearts
Since a kid this is how we live, ain't nuttin to look forward to
Schools full of devils

Ya'll it'll be hell before we get there
Survivin guns and drugs and see if you can deal with this germ warfare
Thats endin us

Up your life, I'll make you love it

So get cha' ass up just to get on down
Snoop Dogg and Bad A$$ is puttin it down
Repeat

Verse 2-Snoop Dogg
Never pause on my feet, I'm DPG, LBC, me and B-A-D
Low ridin', and Navigators foe the haters
I take some for now, and save some for later
Smoke with Coke Loc
A dip with Tip Tip
Get heat a chrome plate, a D from Tray Deee
Livin that DP, give me that ST
In a 4-0 a 0-E from my OG
And a bag of them ol' hot ass skins
Some Colt for this hand
And some juice for this gin
Ain't no bitch like this bitch I got
Cuz this bitch I got, clock nots and rocks
Money, cheese, paper, fedio get doctor Nedios, and stank is steady goin
Bangin that, slangin that, and hangin that every corner
From up north to Dogg Pound California
You heard of that gangstaville
The city where they don't talk and everybody C-walk
It's a dirty shame, but it's a dirty game
And you got to have heart from the start man
Fake snitches and fake bitches
Thats probably why I break niggas and break bitches
Word on the streets Bad A$$ is a fool
Then he fuckin with his homeboy from the old school
Low life gangstas, Dogg Pound gangstas, put them all together
Man I love gangstas
Head, shoulders, feet and toes
Lets dip to the club and bust some hoes
V.I.P. on DPG, Snoop D-O double G, and the B-A-D

Chorus x1

Verse 3-Bad A$$

Only talk what you know
I never seen you round the Pound
So won't you keep the eastside and deez out ya mouth
Don't speak on dat
Don't bring up Daz and Kurupt, just to say wussup, nigga hit my blunt
We keep a money move, hate while we regulate
And get real papes, rich like Bill Gates
While you make it to the Haters Hall of Fame
We'll be whippin Navigators
Winnin this baller's game
Yellin Long Beach niggas keep puttin it down
Lowlife and at the Pound while we smoke on an ounce
Steady plottin on big mail
Layin in the hotel
Chop my quarters down to dubs and watch my dope sell
I hit Darochee come and scoop me
Drop me off ?and they was snoopy's? said he puffed a little ?play?
And shorty played it only ?twice?
Ay, they set a 8 beat
It's them and 6 hoes in a jeep
They better go flag em' down in the street
Ay, follow us to the spot
While the playa hatas pray that we stop

And when a problem come, learn to deal with 'em
Do you swear to turn this chopper
On any motherfucker in your path, or the bitch that's trying to stop ya
Or do you promise to keep him handy
And don't hand him to nobody, nobody except family
And keep him cocked and loaded and don't expose him to no body
Unless somebody, who want him in his body
To love and cherish and from this trigger to a barrel
From the bottom of your heart
'til death do you fuckin' part
Do you understand to live, to lie by him
Is to share your soul, Lord knows, you gone die by him
I know you heard gun stories about John Wayne and Billy the Kid
Shit, all them motherfuckers dead
And did you know that every other bitch from the Wild, Wild West
End up dying from hollow points to they fuckin' chest
Cause I ain't never seen a cock beamer meant for a team of tummy guns

Turn the lights all the way down
So make me flow

[Verse 1]
J-A-Y: I flow sick
Fuck all y'all haters, blow dick
I spits the game for those that throw bricks
Money, cash, hoes, money, cash, chicks
Sex, murder and mayhem - romance for the street
Only wife of mines is a life of crime
And since life's a bitch in mini-skirts and big chests
How can I not flirt with death?
That's life's enigma, long as life's within us
We gonna sin a lot and pray that Christ forgive us
Fuck it!
Ice the wrists and raise the price on these niggas
Y'all can't floss on my level!
I'll invite you all to get with us if your ball is glitter
When I go all the Harlem playas wall my picture
If you get close enough, you can read the scripture
It reads: money, cash, hoes. How real was that nigga?

[Hook](x2)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes(what!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes(uhh!)
Money, cash, hoes, money-cash-hoes(c'mon)
(WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!)

[Jay-Z: Verse 2]
Flavors robust, platinum and gold touch
Yea I rap now, fast money, dun slowed up
Niggas try to stop Jay-Z to no luck
Roc-A-Fella foreva CEO, what! What?
Us the villains? Fuck your feelings!
While y'all player hate we in the upper millions
What's the dealings? It's like New York's been soft
Ever since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings
I'm trying to restore the feelings; fuck the law, keep dealing!
More money, more cash, more chilling
I know they gonna criticize the hook on this song
Like I give a fuck...I'm just a crook on this song!
Bed-Stuy Brook-nam took on the world
Shit, I led a life you can write a book on
Sex, murder and mayhem, romance for the street
Man, and I tell ya, it'll be the best-seller

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 3 - DMX]
D-M-X and my dogs bite
Jigga, my nigga, rhyme all night
Thugs for life, one night with this rap shit
Let em go and I bet they know what'll happen
When we clap shit
Actin like we owe em something
Then we show em something
Talking greasy...I think they found em down the road or something(wooh)
Fuckin with a madman in a bad mood
Is like fuckin with a mad dog that wasn't fed food
And the only thing that's stoppin him is you
Cause the only thing that he'll be droppin is you(what)
Choppin in two,(uhh), Droppin it to CLUE(c'mon)
And the response from the street:
This was one dog that loves raw meat!
Just cause I, love my niggas
I shed blood, for my niggas
Let a nigga holler ""where my niggas?""
All I'mma hear is ""right here my nigga!""

Okay okay okay, so now the guy's working for Jay-Z
Making hot songs
But any type of trouble he gets in, he runs to Jay-Z
Trouble with the label, he calls Jay-Z
But he still has to come up with Jay-Z's money every week no matter what
Not selling any records, FUCK YOU PAY ME
Oh you want me in your video, FUCK YOU PAY ME
No one's coming to your shows huh, FUCK YOU PAY ME
And then what do you do when you can't borrow another dollar from the label?
You can't sell any singles in the stores?
You light a match....you blow the joint (*explosion*)

What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry
You know that you got me

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Somebody told me that this planet was small
We used to live in the same building
On the same floor, and never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour, and peeped this Ethiopian queen from Philly taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo, flash, focus, record
Said she working on a flick and could my clique do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris at Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart
And tend to shatter, she like, ""That shit don't matter.""
When I get home, get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever; let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Telling me the things I'm telling her is making her hot
Starting building with her constantly round-the-clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop, and keep telling me…

I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry

[Verse 2: Black Thought + Eve]
Yo, I'm the type that's always catching a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip
And get on some old… another lonely night
Seem like I'm on the side, you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper
Daddy, keep that shit tight
But, yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?
While politicking with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player
And he think I'm pretty—psych, I'm playin', boo
You know it's just with you I'm staying, boo
And when cats be poppin' game
I don't hear what they sayin', boo
When you out there in the world I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweating on stage, think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listening to your homies
They be leadin' you blind
Yeah, so what you saying, I can trust you?
Is you crazy?! You my king for real
But sometimes relationships get ill, no doubt

[Hook: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry
You know that you got me

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
That snake could be that chick
And that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering, ""She trying to play you for the fool, Black.""
If something's on your chest then let it be known
See, I'm not at you every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be, I ain't on some ""Oh, I'm a celebrity!""
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to their squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where their whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like…

Catch a body with the shottie, pump up one dead

For that's dragon, that's the one
What's blastin, that's his gun
Who's lastin, no one
So if you splashin to blow one
Like I said before, I'ma lock it down like Shaqula
So make your sister be the ??? and none back to her

Yukmouth:
After midnight, busta niggas can't even hang out
Niggas on the west, we put them dank things out
Drive by and try to blow them fuckin brains out
And cocaine drought
Survive and reside with a new click
But use the same route
Pull the range out
Get brains pal, while I'm drivin
Live and direct, front five and a tech
Stash in the Range, but nine in the Lex
Got bitches, shining briggets, for me
Grindin correct, for me
Signin off checks, for me
Send a bitch outta town, now she buyin the bricks, for me
Passes from the brick, homie
Keep grindin with your click, homie
Cause on top there's no way
Cock your chromayy
Stock your monayyy
Feds caught the homayyy
It's just the monay got coppers on mayyy
Helicopters on mayyy, bust off the blockers phonayyy
Ramshack this house, put choppers on it
Bitches safe and shit, niggas takin shit
Break his wrist, pistol whipping duck tape his bitch

Chorus (2 times)

Yukmouth:
Bitch, to all my niggas locked in Rita and Simson
We still the ice cream men
Just switched it up from a truck to a great benz
We made men, and kingpins, triple-beam men
Give me a quarter key, I bet I flip a key
By the weekend, our styles are grand theiven
If not, niggas ain't leavin
Unless they bleed the demon prayer from my deacon
In front of the casket, you done it you bastard
I pack mathematics to keep it crackin
Head ride to ask it, BITCH!

DMX:
How-can-one-man-kill-so-many-and
The-sin-be-plenty-before-the-age-of-20
Life ain't worth a penny in, my book faggot
That's why I took faggot shit, I'm a crook faggot
Fat loops leather jackets, I bag it, along with
The jewels smackin tools out the hands of fools
On the strength that they don't know what they holdin
Niggas called me TAILOR cause the WAY that I be sewin
Shit up cause I get up, off my ass and SKATE
Makin more moves than U-Haul, from state to state
I speak the GREAT, and if a nigga tells you different
You turn around you ask the nigga, ""FUCK is you be sniffin?""
Cause when it come to riffin, I am the riff raffin
Gots to say nuttin, niggas know they get half
And I can still laugh, at those who's toes I'm steppin on
Disrespect and pulling out a weapon on
Nice joint, I know you wish you coulda kept it on
But that's another story, don't even sweat, it's gone (echo gone)

Zone out now, one two, yo
This goes out to all coasts
East coast, West coast
And all across the nation, worldwide
Know what I mean? Relax, kick your feet up
Spark one, let me show you how it's done
Blow lady

Sunrise, starts the day
Lay back, ease your pain
Don't sweat, simple things
Take your time, do your thing

[Pete Rock]
As grains of sand pass from hand to hand
I watch time stand still I'm just one man
That's out for all so all should be for one
Grew up on the drum with the J.B. ""Unh!""
The son, who spun the record that his pop's collected
Went on to create and perfect the unexpected
Funky beat sound watch the family ""Get down!""
Slide with the right and give cousin a pound
Watch the young ones play and think back in the day
When fresh was the style, plus the word to say
It's all love now, let me show you how
To take time out, and show you what life's about

Chorus: Jane Eugene and Carl McIntosh

Take your time walk the line just a matter of time
Take your time walk the line just a matter of time
Take your time walk the line just a matter of time
Wo oh just a mattter of time

Feel the flow, and let it go
Unwind, relax your mind
Stay a while, take your time
Bet you'll find, peace of mind

[Pete Rock]
With a, douse of soul, I'm back in control
My goal sees the world pass from young to old
Unfold a new tale, see yourself on scale
2000 the year my black people prevail
Yo straight up and down I got love for this son
Nine years in the mix and if time permits
I'll continue to make my melody for the tapes
And walk the fine line between love and hate

I told him to slow down, he said the sun don't chill

Shitted on, so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall wit em
Molest concepts, start rhythm, paid dues, bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call
Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall

Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't the U-Ac
No mo', still together
Like in the ghetto photo wit one nigga in the chair
Holdin liquor in despair, gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory

[Produced by D Moet, Pretty Boy & Trackmasters]

[Intro: Nas (w/ Puff Daddy)]
Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turning back now
This is what makes me; this is what I am

[Hook: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now,(Q.B.) but I won't stop now (real niggas)
Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts) you can hate me now (c'mon)
But I won't stop now, cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now, you can hate me now

[Puff Daddy]
Well you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die
You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down
Weak, jealous motherfuckers
Fuck y'all!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try, close your eyes
Picture me rollin', sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence
For this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

[Diddy]
Money is power motherfucker
I got millions of thugs on salary

[Hook: Diddy]

[Verse 2: Nas]
You wanna hate me then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money, funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin' ""that's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same O.G
People warn me, when you're on top, there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that, what you expect, ho?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, cause niggas feel this right

[Diddy]
You think I'mma come this far, and let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too!

[Hook]

[Diddy] I like this, I like the way this feels

[Verse 3]
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were picking them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer
Guess it's just the theory of man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come from day one, forever ballin'
C'mon

[Diddy]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me, ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!

Bounce (yeah), rock, skate (yeah), roll
Bounce, rock, skate (ha), roll
Bounce

[Baby DC]
It's Friday, I had to work all week
Keep the cool hip, school, gettin' A's and B's
Cuz if I came home with an F or a D
My momma woulda tripped about the skatin' rink
But since I got that under control
Daddy said it's cool, get his spark on
So I picked up the phone and called Rico
I told him I'd be at the rink for sure
Around 8 o'clock, they began playin' the grooves
That me and you like to bounce to
We rollin' man, on skates for sure
A gang of homies in the corner on the dance floor
Got the skate police always on patrol
Tryin' to catch you outta bunker if you gettin' too close
To the girl that you groovin' with
No stoppin' on the floor, keep moving it
To wearing straps to my feet, criss-cross to the beat
And all the people tryin' to peep the styles of the D
Cuz I'm rollin', just havin' a ball
No time to laugh when somebody falls
Straight bouncin'

[Imajin]
Bounce (just see), rock, skate (everbody skatin' on the floor)
Roll, bounce (c'mon, c'mon), rock, skate (rollin', rollin', rollin')
Roll, bounce

[Baby DC]
Now it's 10 o'clock and the music stops
And it comes back on with a slow song
The announcer says 'Couples only'
And then all I see is cuties rushing at me
So I chose the one that I knew could roll
Not one steady fumble on the skatin' floor
Follow what the Joe shootin' pass me like the wind
When Darnell fallin' down and back up again
And bysides from the club to the video game
Playin' Mortal Kombat, tryin' to arrest the thing
To the snack bar, munch, get my drink and change
Rested up, now I'm back on my wheels again
Straight bouncin'

[Imajin]
Baby D is bringin' out the fine young breeds
Parties jumpin, V.I.P
We off the heez (we off the heez)
Roller skate is one in front and one be-hind
Everybody, grab your partner, form a line
And get

Bounce, rock, skate (yeah), roll
Bounce

[Baby DC]
And you know there's 30 minutes left (*sigh*)
I'm on my second wind and I done caught my breath
I'm on to the DJ's booth to request a song
Baby D's on the rise, now I'm up and gone
As I look to my side, I see my Daddy
So smooth, on the wheels like a caddy
With his Afro, lit it in diamonds is butch
And then I, switchin' lanes at a fast pace
Losin' all the slow rollers up on my way
So I can find that girl and all her friends
So we can hook next week and come do it again
Out here gettin' excite, the GA way
But I learned how to skate in the Golden State
Straight rollin'
So everybody keep bouncin'
So everybody keep bouncin'
So everybody keep bouncin'

[Imajin]
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce (yes, you're bouncin'), rock, skate (you wanta skate, yeah)
Roll, (yes you do)

Hon you need to get your ass on the dancefloor this minute
We bruise stuff, knock you out shoes, socks
Show your ass, move your fuck out, we're mad smoove snots

Don't make me get money and platinumize my body
With bright stuff, known to earn a dyke's love
Blind folks be like, ""Somebody turn the lights off""
Immense rep, poppin out a muffin
Make famous artists that's dead hop out a coffin
At the real estate, behavin type choosy
Want a palace with the shit beige and light blue please
Got the kid like ""watch your manners""
Since I came out of jail, it's like the planet gone bananas

Now eat that, OutKast and Ricky D, bitch can you beat that?
Remember the time I laid them down to Teenage Love now see that
Just to sport a rhyme and break in new patterns like hymens
Shuckin and jivin was never the style
I'm gon' keep on beatin this line
Spittin that King Shit, you cling shit
A tailor and a seamstress
New gators for you haters and the penis for all you beatches
Like an addiction cause I need it, hip-hop is that I be that
Like a junkie showin your monkey, cause I sho' nuff like to beat it
Might just eat it just to skeet it, fold you up like you was pleated
Like some slacks and, relaxin, be strollin like some cats then
I got a, baby daughter, and I feed her with this rappin
Not trappin, b-boy, but rappin, huh

[??] cops more white and hit claims
I serves everything from white to mary jane
I'm hittin the one times with a fake last thing
Just to keep my ass on the streets, in the game, it's automatic

(Chorus)
I represent the hoodrats and the B.G's
The niggas on the corner whop white to make cheese
If you want some then niggas bring static
It's automatic

(Verse 2)
You need to get at me, I'm the G
Locin and provokin dips blocks with cavi
Search a ki' cross the street and smash out
The '63 bounce back to the same route
You fools best get the fuck off my cold tales
Gang tales of how the fuckin dead body smells
Late night horror shows in jail cells
Represent where you from no one to tell
Life ain't nuthin but the hood and snaps
Hoodrats carry work with straps in they laps
Quarter niggas with nicknames play craps
Enemies tryin to cross the front line
Get capped nuthin but escape, uh
Second flat my gat let loose like 'Rat-a-tat-tat'
The underground hero guess y'all is back
My custom, my khaki suit and a blue cap, automatic

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
I make it difficult for a nigga to find me
Crazy-ass Hoo-Bangin G's behind me
You're fucked up for that last time fo' sho'
Now you know, two in your door, four to the floor
Any nigga wanna bring it-bring
I guarantee your ass will hear the Glock sing
Quick to hit out like [name] the street king
Shells ricochet up your body, ping ping
Eazy don't come to [??] pound
West to the chest
Is the best get-coast
On the contrary I shots down your post
You're gettin next to me, uh, too close
Close down your whole block froze down
Infiltrators end up-no sound
You sorry muthafuckas here's your showdown
Eiht caught a hot one now I'm county-bound, automatic

(Chorus)

(Outro)
Geah
Eihtype in the house c'mon
Geah
Hoo-Bang in the house c'mon
Y'all know how the fuck we do it
Y'all know how the fuck we're livin

You wan' hate me? Cause your wifey, wants a autograph?
From the look in her eyes, I can see she wants more than that
When I see fat asses I make fat passes like quarterback
Beatnuts is ALLA THAT, your shit, ALL THE WACK
Open can-dela, if you foolin wit mah cheddah

I'm fed up, niggas wanna bring it -- WHATEVER!
I'mma storm your pa-rade (pa-rade) blow your legs off
With a gre-nade, now you flappin, like a mermaid

The most range, crazy motherfucker won't change
Beatnuts, forever diehard, you want pain?
Cause you walkin outta here breathin is insane
Flip a beat fast, you leave the club with a heat rash
You got a weak stash, came in the club with a free pass
I ain't even know they made a Roley for your cheap ass
Makin me laugh, you was in jail wearin kneepads
Now the beef has, gotten over your head
It's over you dead, Ranger Rover, both of your legs

When I first came out, many couldn't catch my name
Now worldwide, feel the affects, scratch my name
Rahzel, now rewind that, (Gargling) slow it down, you'll find that
The way I design that, and reverb behind that, not in my contract
I'm bustin all over this bitch, while your girl cums
Down with the Two-One-Fifth, Illadelph, Dy-Nast'
R-double-O-T-S, no need to remind us
You're far behind us, tryin to high beam, blind us
Catching shinas from a nickle plated niner (Gun sounds)
Blastin' holes in your designers
This is for you primadonnas
Cause my persona's like pirhannas
I got you second guessin and sweatin like saunas
If you learned from the second lesson, no question you want it
Change your facial expressions from minutes to seconds to longer
God damn it feel good to see people up on it

Who's the man, Rahzel's the +Man+, so yo, pass the +Method+
1200 styles, crush your crew without no effort
Let me flip my, vocabulary, vocal acrobatics
Smack up phone dramatics, I can jam like automatics
Nine millimeter, twelve rounds, one in the chamber
Russian Roulette, you can bet, there is DAN-JUR
Number five in the Billboard, with the bullet
One million, in my pile, you know the style, let me pull it
Cause I'm about to blast ya, take the mic, then harrass ya
Switch up speeds, without the weed, then I'll pass ya
Nineteen-ninety-nine, octane, because I gassed ya
Watch me George Jet, on-you-son, like I'm NASA

""And I'll destroy anyone, who dares go against me""

Kids doin the chronic from coast to coast kid
Death, what the doctor ordered, so say, ""Ahhh""
Take you +Three Feet High and Risin+, like De La
C'est la vie, I'm yo' super MC
Got the S on my chest for you to buy my LP

Spit the vocals hotter than soul food from Baton Rouge
Come, sharp-tongued like Malcolm, on any album
Some got chrome like Sly Stone, what you about son?

[Intro: King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the Hip-Hop culture, y'all
Brought to you by the world-famous Wake Up Show

[Verse 1: RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tales, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword-play, tongue-twist piercin' holes in you
You can't escape 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Walk with alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops the trunk
Snare pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification

[Interlude]
Wake up, wake up, wake up!
Tech is on

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
When I woke up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up
When I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is comin', look around, your town is crumblin'
This Big Tech from the Midwest
Leavin' MC's listless on the Wake Up Show
Make up no stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher
Partner, you can't fuck with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, cryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling ""Tech N9ne's vild!""

[Verse 3: Eminem]
This place is my house
I might as well erase my face with Wite-Out
‘Cause y'all can't see me like Ma$e's eyebrows
Climbed out of a nice house
Through the front window, and heard this guy shout
""Hey that's my couch!""
Pull a 9 out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin' this shit, put a clip in and spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin' vertical
Nose-first with the top off landing upside down
Get tied down and duct-taped—fuck rape!
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg with my nuts shaved
It's Sway and Tech, two disk jockeys
Breakin' so many freakin' needles I wonder if they inject

[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes, God bless success, never forsake the soul
Xzibit take control—locked, loaded, and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
‘Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can wake up
The X-Man, catch me doin' drills in the Danger Room
Big game huntin' from high noon to the full moon

[Verse 5: Pharoahe Monch]
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts
Bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Karloff was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of skin
So the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast
He asked: ""Why did he have to die like cast metal?""
Oh, see, now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

[Verse 6: Kool G Rap]
I sway the TEC with the Tech and Sway
Step away, weapon spray, rep today
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board, like checker play
When I blaze, your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the tre, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin' like lead from out the Heck and K
Tearin' your neck away, flood up the street with blood redecorate until the head of Jakes investigate

[Interlude: Jayo Felony]
Sway can give it to, but what you gon' do with it?
Tech can give it to you, but what you gon' do?
Rev can give it to you, but what you gon' do with it?
I can give it to you, wha-wha-wha-what-what!

[Verse 7: Chino XL]
Chino make the world go 'round
Fuckin' up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, ominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you with this time
The most commonest thought
The drama that's brought caught us
In the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style filed sexual harassment, like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin' murder your young style, like Jon Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg?
Your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show reppin' with Sway and Tech
My TEC's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X—bring KRS in!

[Verse 8: KRS-One]
De-de-de-da-de-de-de-da-di-day
KRS-One comin' with the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget: the bigger the budget, the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willin' to rock in the middle of dry
And in the middle of wet
But I'm willin' to bet, on a Sway and a Tech, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gainin' respect
Nevertheless I wreck you
Now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back, but for now just seckle
Ha ha ha! Fresh for 1999, you suckers!

[Hook: GZA]
Breaker, breaker one nine, clear the line
Can you read me? Shortage on rhymes
MCs should expect the worst
I stay alert and shoot first

[Verse 1: GZA]
This is not a test, it's difficulty
Picture closely, the ignorant mostly
Blind, deaf, dumb, your mind left numb
Lost soul who failed to hear the roll of the drum
In the bottom of your bomb shelter, still felt the
Heavy blast that blew off the masks of twelve welders
The math of an elder, praise the Lord, thank you Genius
Operation: Project English
Commander the chief of flight style, check the aircraft
Glide like the frisbee, Digi [?] Disney
To check fault in oneself is pure loveliness
You break the mirror that remind you of your ugliness
So when I bust, no one is untouched
Some returning with the mic clutched, like such
Who plan but never execute
He had the heat in his hand, but yo he didn't shoot
Therefore your mechanism of material better be sickly
Or let your lead spread incredibly quickly
I move bravely, travellin' on a horse
On the battlefield, surrounded by the lost
Of those who plotted with the brains of animals
My high molecular structure be untangible
The name ring a bell, killable two syllable
The Wu is comin' through, the outcome is critical
To be blunt, the beat was cooked up like coke goods
The rhyme first came to me in the oak woods
Up to no good, rap icon
Milk the industry like the Wall Street junk bond
You see the bright stone, I got your height sewn
Direct current, that move through the mic-phone
Key contributor, well-known major factor
Rhyme distributor, the drive of a tractor
Who run ya down if you don't move or wanna linger {*echoes*}

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 2: GZA]
The immortality of my fame is the measure of other's torture
Burnt offer, from a flamin' author
The falconer who flies enough birds for the chase
Strictly excel in what is excellence with grace
The significance was not the vulgar applause of interest
But the feelin' that exit, completion of a sentence
With age and experience, my reason ripens
I strike on you Vikings, slash like a hyphen
If you enter the house of fortune by the gate of pleasure
You will leave by sorrow, the flow measures
Everything fails with the unfortunate
Learned that recordin' it, so my mind broaden it
Track records ranks us with the exceptional
Extreme complex physics, high technical
The truth is usually seen and rarely heard
What's more dangerous than hatred is the word
You wild cards, jack of all trades
Those who parade their positions show their spades
A large flock of MCs, they figure to be taught
It ain't hard to see why I'm vigorously sought

Didn't think a ghetto bitch could come this far
From pushin' Buicks to candy apple red Jaguars
Bitch think I'm rich, I could rock a Fubu suit
A furry Kangol with some cowboy boots
And still be the shit of the night
When I come through
You be on the side holdin' ya cups like the bums do
Waitin' for the Queen to put some change in it
I pull out a 'G' and drop it with a hundred grand left in my pocket
I promoted this shit, so I got's to make a profit
And all the ends are sins to my men's, down at Spofford
Me and Lil' Cease, it's part two, me partners
Layin' niggas down like carpenters
So pardon us, like Nike's, we just do it
We ain't amateurs to this shit, we used to it
And all the bodies I killed, keep 'em on file
So when they anniversaries come, we pop Cristal
Ask Bristal, the Golden Child, ta-dow
Take it how I gives it, you talk it, you live it
And don't forget it, bitches

[Puff Daddy]
Stop tryin' to sound like her too, bitches

[Chorus]

[Chorus Ad-Libs: Lil' Kim]
Ya'll muthafucka's do not wanna play with us
Ya'll don't wanna play with us
We will fuckin' kill you

Chorus 2X: Lil Dap & Agallah

As the weed burn kid, I'mma make it in life
Am I qualified for a crib, a kid and a wife?
Do I have to stay worried getting shot stabbed with a knife?
Gettin caught gambling dice, to hustling ice
Going to jail once, going to jail twice
A nigga sold, 25 to triple life yo

{Lil Dap}
We took time in the ghetto building with O.G.'s
To askin me, do we know the code of the streets
Walkin the beat, in the hood where it's all good
A Tear For The Ghetto, they don't wanna be in hood
It's like a tear in disguise, decides to get wise
And through my eyes, I can see through these fake ass guys
I turn a thug into a rapper, a rapper into a thug
Throw that ass into the street, show him no more love
I guess these cats have brought reality from the one of above
Too deep in the game, can't concentrate
Droppin bombs in the ghetto, like the game of Kuwait
Meditatin with my niggas, cuz we just can't wait
36 months left till the year 2G
I've granated with my niggas across the land and see
Because we channel thru our music and thats all we know
Comin from the ghetto with that ill ass flow
Got to reach the top, got to reach our goal
Separating real brothers from these weak ass souls
What? Channel thru our music and thats all we know
Comin from the ghetto with that ill type flow
Got to reach the top, got to reach our goal
Separating real brothers from these weak ass souls

Chorus

As the weed burns kid I'mma make in in life
As the weed burns kid I'mma make in in life

Interlude:
Why are we doing this?
Because the families have no love

{Agallah}
At the city, crime found dead eight o'clock sharp
Nigga get murdered, right by the string of a harp
Cannot get saved from the heart, and I'mma bring this art
Like an exhibit in Greenwich Village nigga, Agallah Mozart
Rock shots to block and drive the Benz slow start
Lyrics keep going when Po's say pull over
I'm just a soldier, man, I'mma go far
Some of you never made it, cuz you refuse to know god
Comin at me with crowbars, when I'm comin out of 4 cars
Fillin so many maggots in me, Corleone tron
Puerto Rico my homeland of the man sipping the motar
My whole clique, G.I. Joe, y'all are Cobra
Stay fake niggas, is always caught John Blaze
Contemplate, moves of Agallah 8, make a mistake
Yo I come to your wake, with 5 niggas with bandanas
Yo, your clip insert banana arm

Chorus 2X

{Melachi The Nutcracker}
Just to make it in life, I used be livin trife
To be precise, run up on you with a gun or a knife
And that's word, to my fam on 183rd
Yo A-Mob, and fuck what you heard
The Battle Cat is back, but I'm no longer 16
I'm down with Dap and we don't shine we gleem
The Group Home team is tight like old slacks
Off the meat rack, slappin weak rappers back
You get caught up in my trap, and see that this is no act
I wan't more than a small stack, move against me and fall flat
Is the black man qualified to make it in life?
Or will he die trying, to earn some stripes
I gotta eat, so you will meet your defeat
To make my mission complete

Chorus 2X

As the weed burns kid I'mma make it in life
As the weed burns kid I'mma make it in life

Cause we'll drop a cuzzie that leaves your whole label woozy
And shitty and dizzy because your whole city miss me
And whip out they titties
And from they kiddies throw me 50's in bundles of 100's

I ran into this girl I used to see in Eastwick
She wasn't all that fine, but now she lookin thick
I was feeling kinda hungry so she took me out to mix
She wore some Calvin Klein's that was showin off them hips
And shit, that ass was a eye catcher
And I stress ya, if she let 'cha, you bet ya
X-redbone fetcher
She a go get it girl
Drank Hen and don't hurl
Was priceless like a pearl
Stayed wet a ????
Got caught up in ???? and came and scooped me from the ????
Took me out to where she at, just like that
Late night she called me up so she could get on her job
Work hard overtime, and I don't pay her a dime
Playa keep her mind, her body already mine
And we will meet you at the finish line
I'ma tell her that I know it's gonna be some drama
You cuffin her like an anaconda
But I still got a thang for your baby momma

[Hook]

I got my eye on ya bitch and ya baby momma
Save the drama, cause I really don't want it
I was mindin my business, all alone
Drivin down the street, makin calls on the phone
I'm a player, even in your town
Your baby momma's kinda cute, roll ya window down
She asked me 'what you gettin in to tonight?'
I said 'you baby, I hope it ain't too tight'
She laughed and then I told her, holla at me later
Here's the number to my pager, two fingers like a player
Rolled out, and when she hit me on the beep
I found out your baby momma's a freak
I know ya turned her out when she was young
Got her doing thangs wit her tounge
I'm havin hella fun
Stop puttin in work like a fool
Lost a good women to a real player, you know the rules

[Jazze Pha]
Now I done seen this whole thang for what it's 'sposed to be

[Half-A-Mil]
Beware these thugs, beware these slugs, beware these heaters
My son robbed Run for his first pair of Adidas
We thugs forever. Don't believe us? Put up ya cheddar
Street sweeper bullets fill up ya sweater
This songs good, and getting better
We swallowed jewels, now we shittin treasure
Follow the rules, now we rich forever
Straight through the six, and better
We were slaves on the ship together
Now we workin and getting dick sucked together
Half-A-Mill spitting g-noes, sailin the ski-boats
Taken detours, sippin 'crys, blowin out weed smoke
The bitches got me 'round, send the product out of town
The streets of half a nigga, doin life up in the mountains
Players and accountants, cash flowin from the fountains
I'll thrill em later, chicks in the mountains, chicks surround me
Its astounding, respected
Half-A-Mil thug protected, so say I'm drug connected
They murders were un-expected

Chorus 2X

[Noreaga]-Outro
Fuck them niggas, fuck them niggas
Fuck them bitches, fuck them bitches
Fuck them niggas, fuck them niggas
Fuck them bitches

Fuck them niggas, fuck them niggas
Fuck them bitches, fuck them bitches

[Intro: The Madd Rapper & 50 Cent]
The art of getting robbed
This is how we do Brooklyn-style, boy, you know what I'm saying?
R.I.P B.I.G - nigga R.I.P P.A.C - R.I.P
Enough of that shit, it's time to O.D, one time

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
The bottom line is I'm a crook with a deal
If my record don't sell I'mma rob and steal
You better recognize, nigga, I'm straight from the street
These industry niggas is starting to look like something to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, ''You want to see her again?
Get your ass down to the nearest ATM''
I have dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
But I wake up early and bounce with all her shit
When I apply pressure, son, it ain't even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight, I can get that nigga anytime
Have Keith sweating staring down the barrel on my 9
Since these Harlem World niggas seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan tell him, ""Tell your man""
Mason Betha, haha, come up off that watch now, I mean right now
The only excuse for being broke is being in jail
An entertainer can't make bail, he broke as hell
I'd rob ODB, but that'd be a waste of time
Probably have to clap him, run and toss the 9
I'd follow Fox in the drop for 4 blocks
Plotting to jux her for that rock Kurupt copped
What, Jigga just sold like 4 milli, got something to live for
Don't want a nigga putting 4 through that Bentley Coupe door
I'll manhandle Case like ""dope, get on the ground
You ain't with Mary no more, where you getting chips from now?""
I been scheming on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
I'm a klepto, nah for real son I'm sick
I'm bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit
Right now I'm bent and when I get like this I don't think
About to make Stevie J take off that tight ass mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun, snatch his piece then run
This nigga weigh 400 pounds, how he gonna catch me, son?

[Hook: The Madd Rapper]
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I'll catch P and Silkk The Shocker right after the Grammy's
And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami
Run up on Timbaland and Missy with the pound
Like you give me the cash, you put the hot dog down
I figured it out, niggas been robbing Joe before
That's why his ass don't wanna be a player no more
My attitude while robbing J.D., fuck you, pay me
Had Da Brat with em, should've had his gat with him
DMX wanna get down, well, you tell, homie
I'm on that Treach shit, I do my dirt all by my lonely
I should rob Clue, man, his shit did well
I wanna stick TQ, but his shit ain't sell
I hit the studios, take niggas' jewels and leave
Catch Rae, Ghost, and RZA for them funny ass rings
Tell Sticky give me the cash before I empty three
I'll beat your ass like that white boy on MTV
Canibus wanna battle while I'm sticking him up
Fuck the cab, the coroners picking 'em up
Heavy tried to hide his shit, hey nigga I saw you
He said ""Why you robbing me? I got nothing but love for ya""
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all he said, ""Even my gold teeth?""
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black Jeep
One at a time, get out and take off your shine
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?
And walk off with your shit like it's mine?
Imma keep sticking niggas until I'm living
I'll rob Boyz II Men like I'm Michael Bivins
Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robin Givens
I'm hungry for real, I'm about to stick Mister Cee
That nigga still eating off Big's first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor
He asked me if I had enough, I told him ""gimme some more""
Is you feeling this? Then wait for the sequel
I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbing God's people

[Hook: The Madd Rapper]
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?
This ain't serious
Being broke can make you delirious
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?

[Outro: The Madd Rapper]
For real, yo, you know what I'm saying?
Niggas got to get stuck up, that's just how it goes down
It don't matter if you an industry nigga or a regular nigga or a bitch
It don't matter if you got it and I need it I want it
You know what I'm saying? That's just how it go down
50 Cent ain't fucking around, Trackmasters ain't fucking around
Crazy Cat ain't fucking around, The Madd Rapper ain't fucking around
You know what I'm saying?
So watch your backs, watch your pocket book, watch your pockets
Watch everybody on the train, watch everybody on the bus
Cause we gonna get you whether you like it or not

Chillin' with the home boy Mack 10
And we gon' lay a lil' sumpin' down for y'all
Let y'all know what time it is
Show you how we keepin' it real wit' it
You know, cuz this world is built on material thangs
But we ain't trippin' off that
We want y'all to know this, check it

[Hook]
I want it all; money, fast cars
Diamond rings, gold chains and champagne
Shit, everydamn thing
I want it all; houses, expenses
My own business, a truck, hmm, and a couple o' Benz's
I want it all; brand new socks and drawls
And I'm ballin everytime I stop and talk to y'all
I want it all, all, all, all
I want it all, all, all, all, all

[Verse 1]
They say, 'There go Warren G with that envious stare'
I love this game too much, I wish these haters wasn't here
It's a shame, we came too far to turn back
It's a cold world, it gets so hard, you learned that
]From falling, tryin' to walk from crawl
Tryin' to hustle up from broke to ballin'
And, yeah, y'all in effect that's all me
The jiggy G-Z, all my niggas that keep it real and do it easy
Believe me, young nigga, fat meat is greasy
And shit stank, so if you plot a lick and hit a bank
And get away, or get gaffled, the very next day
Don't cry, hold your head up high
And remember what you told yourself, nigga

And thanks to y'all, I got plaques on the wall
Mack 10 laced with the know how to paper chase
Crushed ice, throw my Rollie face in the platinum fan base
]From net workin' and hustlin', no doubt, I got clout
And live the lifestyle that Robin Leach talkin' about
Slow down player, don't hate cuz you can't relate
The Bently Coupes and kickin' gears on Harley's with the straights
I got more lime light than Vegas on cable
Will it enable to shoot C-Note ""Yo's"" at the crap table
And while you can't get off the ground, I'm getting high
A nigga fly and fly, with the desire to build an empire
I strapped up and took flight like a missle
Told them loud and clear as a whistle 'Hoo Bangin' is official'
Handing out gold medallions at roll-call
I'ma ball and never fall cuz Mack 10 want it all
What

[Verse 3: Warren G + Mack 10]
Me and 10 get paid escapade to the spot
We hot like rocks served on hot blocks
I notice money make the world circulate
So we gon' stack and stack and take a sip and perculate
Bump, let the woofers sub (sub), show the homies love (love)
Warren to the G (G), and Little G-Dub (Dub)
Surface on the low, slide or don't slide at all
Ride or don't ride at all
Warren, I couldn't be more serious about my 'fetti
I stay tight on the mic and keep the pen movin' steady
I want it all, dog, and it might be greed
I hate to trip, but I got two little mouths to feed
They don't know nuttin' about no excuses and disrespect
Or somebody bein' jank with they Daddy's royalty check
And at that point, I'm through talkin', dog, enough said
So, if you owe Mack money, then I suggest you break bread
I want it all

I want it all; money, fast cars

Pimpin' ain't no illusion
And pimpin' ain't never died

Real hoes gon' front on a simp
But she gon' do it for daddy
Fuck niggas watch The Mack and try to pimp on my floozie;
But, boy, my bitches know the difference
Between real pimpin' and movies
It's the difference between real leather
And that shit at yo' house
I don't know what y'all doin' up there
But we really pimpin' in the South
Every since I was 17
I been stackin' my green
Went for servin' rocks to fiends
And rockin' club full a teens
Went from bumpin' Screw in Houston
Sippin' promythazine
To ridin' in a 8 600 with sheath
To smokin' on sticky green
I'm still Pimp C, bitch
I'm claimin' P.A., they hate us;
But, me and Kool Ace rollin' a Lexus

If you got any love fo' that broad you wit'

In cities where big pimpin' is my hoes clean
No AIDS, herpies, cyphillis

Damn, can't you taste it?
Now yo' money's up in smoke
Like you freebased it
Now bitch replaced it
Wit' a sexual favor
But don't get mad at real pimpin', nigga
Check yo' behavior and savor
The aroma from Promona to Tacoma;
Got my pimpin' diploma for bein' a Cadillac chromer
Fuck a Sonoma
I'm on a mission for Benzes
Knowin' 'xactly where my ends is, ballin' relentless
And then my friends is
Slappin' niggas with glass chins
It's funny sendin' tricks home
Broke and defenseless; and, ever since this
Boy been pimpin' the pen

Without my pimpin' again that's why

You was a broke bitch
You couldn't even smoke shit
Couldn't stay fo-cused
And, don't forget it, bitch

Now I'd of called the hoe a bitch before
But now I'm trying to be cash
Cause I know that the wrath of the mob

Feel the heat from the streets, I got to eat
Talk what I walk, I stalk with bronze feet
Ancient spells, yell durag sheet
Jump on the jame with with 36 peak
Beat up the beat, overload rap treat mix
Cape in the wind like the John Woo flicks
Now, take the spirit, crash more clearer
The sweat of the body, covers the man in the mirror
Kick down the door, unlease the Terror Fam
Cracklin, screamin, crime who I am *echo*
Who else could cut, well budge, eye on the tiger rap
Ruler rough mind snap, cryin, his eyes strapped
Beneath clothin, prehaps speed glowin
The golden wise domes, blizzard unknown
The unforbidden, got to live, wildstyle begun
So uplift the mind, boy I'll bring out the sun

[Hook x2: U-God]
You trapped in this rap in this world bizarre
And ya hit pretty hard in the city of frauds
But uplift the mind and I heal ya scars
Cuz rich, tall or small, we all shinin stars

[U-God]
Now, first of all, yo, we ain't no saints
Can we lay in the trench and rock the war paint?
The same villain scheme, temper made the rhythm mean
My self-esteem, my '98 blade hit 'em
Link spot blast, even though I shot last
The underdog stranger, superfreak hot blast
The hard drop rip is a hostile swing
Kiss my Redemption with a fist full of sting
Swift with the gifts, it's the God Body Squad
It's not a myth, we defy all odds
Now, reach for the stars, now top to the limit
But, all in the all be
Grateful to be livin
While we work the muscle, we meditate the hustle
Serious the world, experience this struggle
The razor voice, flavor choice steam, redeem
We feelin prominent now to dominate the scene
The grass more green, attack speed lean
The cliffhanger vaccine, man & machine *echo*
Now from round one, mayor style sum
I won't stop the war till y'all drown in my drums

[Hook x2]

[U-God]
Now, here come the rhythm, style that's moist
Now, it's up from the Hell with the olive oil voice
Now hurry my hurt, bury dirt deep within
Against sweaty rap war starvin, robbin the wind
Out the great blue skies and the bright red birds
From the pitch black city with the long link furs
Golden Arms yours truly to restore the Earth's beauty
Grant me a beast, now kill me with the jury
When I tell on a capell, Hell has no fury
A force has awakened, breath-takin vengeance
Midnight power plant, seekin the menace
My wrestler's vest, livin fresh, dry bone
My appetite distruction is official cyclones
Thai poems, my throne
One shot fill, bigger homes, bigger stones
It's on now!!!

[Hook x2]

Kung Fu movie sample:

[Man #1] We're the best, I assure you
[Man #2] That's not what I've heard
There's a lot of Shaolin men around here
[Man #3] They're not important
[Man #1] Are you trying to deceive me?
[Man #2] Those damn Shaolin students. They're just a bunch of rebels
Time and again in the past, the court has given orders
To wipe them out!

Hey yo Puff, check this out pa
I'm tired of niggas hating on a mutha fucka
Let's take it to the next millennium on these bitches
You got to keep bubblin on em
Platinum doublin on em, fuck these niggas
Hey yo, I bumped into these cat an' they was like
""Yeah, what up wit that nigga Puff he swear he nice""
I said yo, the brother dont swear he nice he knows he nice
You public enemy number one right now
But Fuck that there spit that hydro-ghetto shit

[Puff Daddy]
Let's go
That's that shit right here, whom shall I fear
Throw your guns in the air
Socialize, get down, let your ssoouull lead the way
Cause i'm that enemy that you can't see
But you wanna be  you ain't shit to me
Playa, It ain't hard for you to get to me
Playa, my real dogs  they'll spit for me
So if you want whats mine, you gots to have the heart
I've seen em come and I've seen em part
If you ain't want beef then why did you start?
Front from the light catch shots after dark
Suffer, duck or you'll catch these
On the spot, red dots make em all believe
Ain't nobody kicking the rhymes like these
See I do the things that they can't achieve
So don't start bassin' n' I'll start pacing
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
More hotter than the sun
I'm living on the run
Because i'm public enemy number one


Chorus:

One,One,One,One,One
One,One,One,One,One

[Puff Daddy]
Let me ask you, what you got against me?
Is it my girl or is it the bentley?
Is it my house or maybe its all three
I just came up and you're all against me
Now ask yourself, why is he number one?
Now ask yourself, who's done what he's done?
Then ask yourself, you're fit for the long run?
You think its a game cause you fucked the wrong one
Always with God and I don't swing solo
Never back down when I gotta throw dolo
Wanna see me out, but I just won't go though
Pretty young things wanna have my photo
One in the room hangin' on the wall
In rememberance that I rocked 'em all
Got no time for those that think small
Grill me in the club cause they can't ball
Hate shot callers
Hate them ballers
Back in control now I call orders
It's no fun fleeing under the gun
Cause they got me public enemy number one

Chorus

[Puff Daddy]
All you suckers, liars, court testifiers
Wanna infiltrate and break my empire
I spit lines, hit rhymes
Keep dimes sweating
Giving them the juice that they're not gettin'
A bona fide playa, now who got the flavor
A non stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer
I'm the life saver, the New York mayor
Before you try me, you better say your prayers
My word to the wise is: ""Do not cry""
You know that i'm gone then say don't die
I take what I find, put a beat to they rhyme
Thought it was over but I crept from behind
Wanna try to stop me from speaking my mind
Almost 2000 and running out of time
Almost to the point when I wanna bust nines
A lot of strange faces, I can only trust mine
Soldiers in position all on the front line
Don't make a move till I give them the sign
Known as the poetical, lyrical, miracle son
Because i'm public enemy number one

Chorus

[Hurricane G]
Yeah yeah, that's right Puff
That's what I'm talkin about love
Sparklin and glistenin on these motherfuckers
These niggas is walkin around like little bitches
Talkin about what you got and what they ain't got
They got a little jealous and wanna bring you down
But fuck dat, they just mad
Cause you got all the ladies
And you pushin them bentleys, not mercedes, bentleys
You know? and thats just the way the story goes
And thats just the way the story goes
Fuck you niggas and hoes

[Puff Daddy]
You think i'ma come this far and let you niggas stop me now?
Haha picture that....number one, number one, number one

[Puffy]
All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world, you feel me

[R. Kelly-Hook]
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you

[Verse 1]
When it hurt I ease the pain girl, caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl, I'm in your corner
Do what you want, it's your thing girl, I persist and try but
We one in the same girl, it ain't a game
So I can't play with you, I wanna lay with you
Stay with you, pray with you, grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times, we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true, no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you, not just appearance
Stimulate your mind, strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it, but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa, get a little closer
Touch you right, do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one, that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Your soul ain't a toy, you ain't dealin' with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any baguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt, make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile, special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met, I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you, mold you, don't know, let me show you
Ain't no tellin' what we could grow to
Let it be known, I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through, my love's true

[Hook]

[R. Kelly-Bridge]
Don't let him sing you a sad song (No baby)
Waiting for love like this too long
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on him, baby)
All that you need I can give you
(You don't have to wait, you don't have to wait on)
I do, satisfy you
(You don't have to wait on him)

[Verse 3]
I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt, some believe, some lie, cheat, and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak, I'll make you strong, here's where you belong
I ain't perfect, but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm, my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair, I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal, down for you, soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you, plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night, bending bed coils
You're a queen, therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you, cause I simply adore you

The wait is over
Look, look, look

[Verse]
My first encounter with adversity, was somewhat an emergency
I fell off the path and my mental, it needed surgery
The more I stumbled off the more my actions started irking me
I got it together and the top looked like my turf to be
They think money rules I'm rich and I'm done with school
My problems still exist so don't listen to none them fools
For currency they runnin they lives into paid in full
I took a task and made it cash now my path done became cool
My life came full circle at the park was throwing left hooks
Now I'm in the league with Steph Curry and Russell Westbrook
Took a couple bumps boy you never would see my chest shook
My heart came from a lion this path only the best took
I wanna check the critics cause all they things they nitpick
They always seem to skip where he started his ascension
Like reciprocity but that ain't what they give him
I did it from the jump but you stumble, they pay attention
Aware of my surroundings at all time, a wall fly
I spot a coward a mile off, no small mind
Put that pressure all on my shoulders, return with Hulk’s spine
A hot head when they rain on my parade, let my thoughts dry
Experience in my life prepared me for the high life
All the times I struggled just prepared me for the highlights
Used to circle shoes in East Bay, now mine on fly sites
And we can toast to that, my circle sharin' in Mai Tai
My dad been kickin' game since I was young, I've been a sponge bro
100 wads in my pocket, covered by the ones though
Never flex my muscles, don't welcome me to the gun show
Never show it's done, just take care of who it's done for, huh
The dream free, but the hustle, sold separately
Been knew I was only as solid as who was next to me
My cousins, my few good friends, the rest are x to me
Cause bad crowd is only a recipe for rest in peace
I stand out cause I'm a soldier in a sucker's game
That paparazzi tryna shine me boy, I'm duckin' fame
Some dudes call and set it up, and boy that's such a shame
The only time I really stunt is in my stunner frames
I love my life from the good to the bad
Feel good to live with riches when comin' from rags
I paint a picture boy, just give me that pen and that pad
City in pieces, motivatin' the kids with the scrabs, gone

Still doin' that shit, huh, Dre?
(Oh for sho', check me out)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's still Dre Day, nigga, AK, nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
‘Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How, nigga? My last album was The Chronic
They want to know if he still got it
They say Rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves
Still fuck with the beats, still not lovin' police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (for life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still…

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets
Signed Eminem, he's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E.

Whether you're coolin' on the corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track

Still (hittin' them corners on the lo-lo's, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name, still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

And if I drink this Hen'
Everybody will know it
Cause I ain't going for it
So pray to the Lord that I don't pull out
Cuss out and bust out

Tell your man be easy ma, he don't want no problem

Look at the way she shake that thing

My floors mostly sand so you ain't gotta bring ya shoes
My crib is half house, half beach
Sit yo booty on this king size and see the sea
I'm a lil' freaky-o, I might lick ya toes
I got more zero's on my one's than Cheerio's
See your stilleto, shoes, your mac lip gloss
And ain't a dime chick that Drag didn't floss

[Verse 1]
1991 a star was born
My soul was torn in the exact moment that they umbilical cord was gone
And honestly I still think I'd rather stay dead
Cause I'm still a monster that's rage fed in Haze head
But I was born into a ton of curses
Same blood, same genes, just a different purpose
And a different person like all around
My life was fucked up and I let it tear me down
And I always dressed in skirts-es
And I always slept in churches
Didn't believe in shit so I always felt so worthless
Molested at age 7 nobody ever noticed
So I locked myself inside myself and had to keep on growing
Of course you'd never know it
That type of pain is the [?]
In fact it's been 13 years, I still feel a strain on my shoulders

[Verse 2]
It's 2001 and I'm hoping to die
I'm writing suicide letters I mailed to the sky
My biggest question is why
That fucking question remains
But since I sound my purpose I have never felt pressure the same
All of the pressure was drained
And God was here I know it
I didn't choose where I started, but I did choose where I'm going

[Hook 2x]
Every day is hard work: struggle, pain, and dedication
I know it gets hard to end the pain for preservation
If you make it through then every day is a celebration
If you know where you're going everyday's a reservation

[Verse 3]
It's 2007 I'm still looking to heaven
But I'm thinking murder now and I'm using hate as my weapon
I'm using pain as my leverage
I want them to suffer too
Almost lost my whole mind look at what that struggle do
Insanity's blissful in silence
Almost met mental asylums
Outside I'm a quiet storm, but inside a fist full of violence
Dear Ty, I'm sorry that you're gone
I wish you could come back to life so I could kill you on my own
Fuck it all motherfuckers I've made it on my own
And I've never had shit, man I made it here alone
With my brother as my crutch and my mother as my soul
And I didn't choose where I started, but I chose where I'mma go

Body parts we baggin, we ain't comin for the crack
We come to crack backs and ? over niggas hair dew
Split waves, pop off ceasars and graze niggas fades
I creep in a Mustang, bust my heat in the rain
Till they get a rust stain
Y'all niggas heard of me, probably wanna murder me
I'll pull up on ya block and turn your white teeth burgundy
Let's see some surgery

[EVE]
Watch the first lady as she rides
Rougher than the rest of them bitches
What it take for cats to hush they mouth
This one official
Come on clown prove it's still an issue
Streets is ours, have ya homies grieving cause they miss you
Thought it was a game when I said the dogs would get you
Heard you fucked up cause E-V-E bit you
Flex knows what the real is
That's why he deal wit
Ruff Ryders baby droppin bombs nigga feel this

And I don't want the drop coupe so I'm choppin the wagon
Dark navy blue six speed, six air-bags
Even if this shit crash, feel like Six Flags
And ya'll niggas can't block my shells
When I'm in jail the C.O. don't lock my cell
Before any rap group, we was the L.O.X. crooks
I'll slap a hundred dollars on the whole blocks books
And know the block shook, when I walk by
Niggas just like you they rather not look
I inspired y'all niggas to flow
I'mma always get money so I admire ya'll niggas that blow
Ask ya self who the nicest out right now
Put your ice up lets get on the mic right now
Clown, I'm the top cat where it stops at
Where lightning and thunder at
And y'all niggas is under that

[Styles]
If you want it with the P. you gonna get your turn
Tuck my gun while its hot to feel my dick hair burn
Might come through the spot with the shottie and wop
Body the block and hop on the Ducati and rocks
I ain't never drive a bike but I ride on the back
Rob wit a gat, shit I still ride wit my craps
If you wanna go to war we can tally it up
Escalade and Denali it up, what?

Bust yo' gun leave the body where no one go
I pack some shit for any type of situation
Only time I don't pack heat is on vacation
And that's the blow dryer next to the Playstation
I'm big but I use shit to kill you quick
And I don't wrestle unless a chicks in bed on my dick
Flex know I bring somethin hot to the spot

[DMX]
What would you rather have the 10 you found or the 5 you earned
Became a man at 6 cause at 5 you learned
Don't take nothin for granted except death
Man of the house cause you the last nigga left
See how it's going dizzy with the shit so we can blast a rhyme
Hope the Lord got your soul cause your ass is mine
Every time you turn around niggas know that I be right there
East turned to West coast, cravin for the nightmare
Don't give a fuck about what you sling
Cause you ain't slingin that shit, or bringin that shit
Up the hill, but you still singin that shit
Talkin shit like you know what its like to walk this shit
Get on some stalkin shit
So you know what niggas rule New York and shit
I'm just thinkin all the business and how to handle ya'll niggas
All the families that I got lightin candles for niggas
Grieving relatives, grandmothers falling out and needing sedatives
Moms huggin the casket wishin that she raised a better kid

[Swizz Beatz]
Y'all niggas actors
I'll put your face where your muthafuckin back was
Im tired of y'all niggas actors
Y'all know what y'all gonna get

[Verse 1: Fred Durst]
Uh uh uh
Who could be the boss?
Look up to the cross
Stranded in the land of the lost
Standin up I'm sideways
I'm blazin up the path
Runnin' on the highways of rap
Choked up by the smoke and the charcoal
A lotta stamps and brands be like a bar code
I'm bashin all the media strikes
To keep the media dykes
As reinforcements for the fight
And that alone'll keep John Gotti on the phone
I'm tangled in the zone
I got the bees on the track
Where the fuck you at? (Tical!)
Let me hear you pigeons run ya mouth now
(Meth: Shut the fuck up!)
I'm pluggin in them social skills
That keep my total bills
Over a million
The last time I checked it
Thank God I'm blessed with a mind that'll wreck it
Wait until the second round and knock em out

[Verse 2: Method Man]
They call me Big John Studd
My middle name Mud
Dirty water flow
Too much for you thug
And can't stand the flood
What up Doc? Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd
The sureshot
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged (learn)
Temperatures too hot for sunblock (burn)
Playin wit minds
That get you state time
Locked behind 12 bars from a great mind
Killa bees in the club
Wit this ladybug
Brought a sword to the dance floor
To cut a rug
Love is love all day
Till they throw slugs
And take another life in cold blood
Can't feel me til its your blood
Murder rates tremendous
Crime is endless
Same shit different day
Father forgive us
They know not what they do
All praise is due
I'm big like Easy
And Big Bambu

Twelve rounds of throw down, who hold crown
Protect land wit 4 pound, Limp Bizkit
Get around like merry-go, bust a scenario
Comin through your stereo, why risk it?
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
8 essential vitamins and minerals, delicious
Word on the street is, they bit my thesis
Knocked out they front teefes, tryin to taste mine
Actin like they heard it through the grapevine
Dope fiendin for the bassline, to provide rhyme
Pharmaceuticals - hard as nails to the cuticles
Where you find that monster, she beautiful
Wu-Tang and Limp Bizkit roll on the set
Kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug and then jet

[Verse 4: Fred Durst]
Mic check
So whats it all about? (bout)
And where we gonna run? (run)
Maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised
For the blood of virgin eyes
We limpin on the track with the Method
So get the sunblock (sunblock)
You gettin one shot (haa)
Until you dissolve
I revolve
Around everything you got
From outta nowhere
Prepare
You be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare
Now you're turned into stone

[Puffy] (Mario)
I've seen a lot of things in my life
Alot of ups and downs
Made alot of mistakes
No matter what, you've always been by my side
You've always been my best friend
You're the love of my life (Oh)
You're everything to me (Oh)
You never left my side (You're my best friend)
I love you so much (Yes, you are)
You're my best friend

[Puffy]
Since the beginning of time
All you did was bless men
Too young to understand but now you my best friend
How could they doubt you, never think about you
Don't they know nothing's possible without you

Faith without fear that's how they raised me
Words of man kill but never phase me
Grateful for wisdom that you gave me
But still I'm like, dear God I wonder, could you save me?
Too much sinning, gotta be more than plush living
Gotta be more than grabbing nines to buck tin in
Gotta be more than just to lust women
Gotta be more than platinum Rolexes, 600's and crushed linen
Praise your name, I know some of them hate their due
Judgment day, don't they know they can't escape your crew
I'm just trying to live right and pray you take me through
And with this song I dedicate to you, my Lord

1 - [Mario Winans]
Lord, you mean the world to me
Before I was born you chose me
You always hear me when I'm calling
Even catch me when I'm falling
You're the closest one to me
I surrender all to thee
I want the whole wide world to see
That we've always been and we'll always be
Best friends

[Puffy]
Sometimes I reminisce and wonder how I made it this far
Because of you, I'm me, so you the real star
Your hindsight, the time's right to get my mind tight
Then give it to you and let it shine bright
My best friend, only know how to teach the truth
Plant the seeds of life and let them eat the fruit
Can't you see that He spread love for you
Shed blood for you, cry for and die for you
Willies with mac millies know how you get down
We know the drama you bring whenever you hit town
Just remember when you pray, God is love
Gracious, merciful, forgive even the hardest thugs
Life as we know it, it all begins with Him
Life as we know it, it all ends with Him
If I was you I would never try to pretend with Him
He might spaz and blow it, I'm best friends with him

Repeat 1

[Puffy]
Been two and a half years since my man Big passed
Been two and a half years since my world crashed
I needed help, God gave me the power
Gave me the strength to go face to face with my darkest hour
Looked me in the eyes and ask ""What you doing unhappy?""
""Don't you know why I'm here?"" and started shooting at me
Back to the wall, is my faith gonna play out
Never wavered once, gave me no way out
Your time to die, don't even stress the date
You're coming with me, your soul I'm next to take
I told him ""I'm too much blessed with faith""
""And living for Christ"" and then he said ""Manifest the great""
All of a sudden, what I'm remembering
Ground started to shake, everything trembling
The power of the truth was shooting through my Timberlands
Here was my Lord Jesus Christ, my best friend again, come on

Repeat 1 While:

[Puffy]
You mean everything to me
You've been with me from day one
Even when I thought nobody was there
You were there
You're my best friend
I love you like no other
There is no feeling like this in the world
If you can relate to what I'm feeling
Put your hands in the air for me
Let me see you
Naw, matter of fact clap your hands for me
Clap your hands, come on
Thank you Jesus
You always hear me when I'm calling
Always catch me when I fall, yeah
I surrender all to thee
I want the whole world to see
That you've always been, you'll always be
My best friend
I love you Jesus
Thank you, forgive me for my trespasses
As I forgive those who trespass against me
Thank you

I don't just spit, I hauck loogies on these emcee floozies
Y'all beggars can't afford to be choosy
Wanna bubble like jacuzzis, act bouigey, you watchin to many movies
These cats is fruity and got it mixed up like smoothies
Who are we? Yours truly, fist in the air like Huey
Smoke 'em one-by-one like Lucy's, then we skate like 'ooty
Just because yur rhymes is booty don't mean you ""The shit""
Yo my style is universal, I get around like orbit
I got this all up in my veins, so fuck what you sayin
Your stuck in the same frame of mind, ain't no duckin my rain
When it's times for storms to brew, I'm _Warning_ you like Notorious
Before we bust, I won't be courteous
Even if ya moms is in the audience, I'm still the goriest

Rhyme, get mine on the T-O-P
Can another emcee ever FUCK with me?
(Hell no!) ""Y'all niggas Tickle Me like Elmo""
Yo I got hip-hop on deadlock
You wanna pose like models, you catchin headshots
My roots extend to bedrock I stay grounded
The perfect balance, I found it
And I got everybody feelin it
My aura shine like ice and ain't nobody stealin it
Ain't no need to say ""Run your jewels"" when I'm revealin it (True)
And droppin it, on your stupid ass and not concealin it (Put it on 'em)
Cats want you in the dark, no switch that
In fact them cats want you in the pitch black
Where the light switch at? This shit's wack
You try to get some ""Get Back,"" that's how a bitch act
So sit back and observe these gentlemen
With that melanin, we see through the swine like gelatin
So never question my relevance, manifestin all elements
Take hip-hop and develop it, by injectin intelligence
Wackness, you don't just smell of it, you reek in it
We stay feakin it, so the title we keepin it
Hi-Tek is the best kept secret since Diamond D
Kweli consider me the opitimy of emcee

Its the Reflection Eternal ('Ternal)
To universal for rehearsal
No commercials, still we make shit pop like kernals
From Quinn Shore to Myrtle
Whether you stay sober or more pissy than a urinal
My illness is terminal, it's disgustin
The way we be, shuttin down the function
I make my name end any emcee discussion (Who?)
Outta whose whips more fatter, who rock the most ice
While my subject matter shatter your whole concept of nice
You can look throughout history books to see whose liver
I'm prehistoric, got the Eye of the Sabertooth Tiger too
Rip into the flesh of the track
Counterattack before you act with insight
I see clear you blind as a bat
Dwellin in caves, tellin the slaves what'chu think they wanna hear
I swear, my aunt told me the definition of fear is
'Fuck everything and run,' that's what you did
But the party just begun and we rockin 'til we see the sun

I dedicate this to all the pretty girls
All the pretty girls in the world
And the ugly girls too
‘Cause to me you're pretty anyway, baby

[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
You give me your number, I'll call you up
You act like your pussy on interrupt
I don't have no trouble with you fucking me
But I have a little problem with you NOT fucking me
Baby, you know I'ma take care of you
‘Cause you say you got my baby, and I know it ain't true
Is it a good thing? No it's bad, bitch
For good or worse, makes you switch

Bitch-ass niggas, put away your pist-als
Dirty won't be having it in this house
‘Cause, bitch, I'll cripple your style!
Now that you heard my charming voice
You couldn't get another nigga, coochie won't get moist
If you wanna look good and not be bummy
Girl, you better give me that money! Aow!

[Verse 2: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
So I glanced at the girls, girls glanced at me
I whispered in their ear: ""Wanna be with me?""
You wanna look pretty though, in my video
Ol' Dirty on the hat and I let you all know
Just dance if you caught up in the holy ghost trance
If you stop I'ma put the killer ants in your pants
I'm the O-D-B as you can see
F.B.I., don't you be watching me
I don't want no problems, ‘cause I'll put you down
In the ground where you can not be found
I'm just Dirt Dog trying to make some money
So give me my streaks and give me my honey!

Pumpin Mobb up in the Cadillac truck, don't give a fuck

We can fuck, but you ain't getting 10 cent, Who want it?
Lay the facts out until the cats out
Set 'cha back out, sweat 'cha tracks out, blow out your weed
You wake up in the mornin to a note, ""Nigga had to leave.""
Be easy, you shoulda teased me, instead of bein sleazy
I wouldn't do you greezy, come across more floss than gold teeth
I learned you can't eat, if ya hold beef, with niggas underneath
Still I'm a lyrically hold it down
L back in town, 'case the bell sound for second round
Some of these old ctas is funny, fuck who's legendary

Don't want no blood up on my chrome shoes
Lord have mercy, this rookies got it confused
You thought you caught me slippin, I was falsely accused
Sleepin with my eyez wide shut, like Tom Cruise
They wishin an impossible mission to see me lose
Lay up time to choose, all I hate is on the left

Blow the spot in the night for all my niggas like y'all

[Hook]
I speak the truth
Truth, nothin but the truth
Y'all know what I bring to the game I speak the truth
The truth, nothing but the truth

[Verse 1: Beanie Mac]
I hope you got an extra mic and a fire proof booth
Cuz you know I'm known to melt a wire or two
You need a fire engineer when I lay this blaze
I melt down cracks that's real to save
Hit the studio, jars of dro, bars to blow
B. Sigel with that arsenic flow
Fuck that, don't hold me back
I roll with crack, y'all cats told Mac to rap
Y'all don't realize y'all released the beast untame
Speech all flame, streets y'all blame
It should be an honor for y'all to speak my name
I could go before your honor sit and peep my game
Gotta laugh, y'all acted like it spit it the same
Why you motherfuckers can't get in the game
I come from high school, and go straight to the league
Who you know who can spit at the Sig

[Hook]
Nigga the truth, every time I step in the booth
I speak the truth, y'all know what I'm bringing to you
I bring the truth, you motherfuckers know who I be
I be the truth, what I speak shall set you free
Nigga the truth

[Verse 2: Beanie Mac]
Ain't nothin changed with Sig I'm still stuck in the kitchen
So what I'm signed, that's fine still stuck in position
You motherfuckers know me well, couple court cases from jail
Couple 4-4 shells from hell
Stuck on this mission, go home, my girl fussin and bitchin
Motherfucker won't you change your life, I'm thinkin
Motherfucker won't I change my wife
Ignorant bastard laughin like fuck the rap shit
It's just another hustle, another way for niggas to touch you
Now they know the face of Beans
Now they, see my face on screens and I ain't even chase this dream
I feel sorry for those who did
Y'all niggas can't stop the boar, whether rock or raw
I'm slingin coke in a Roc velour
You niggas know what block I'm on, Glock in palm
You wanna get shot, karate chopped or stabbed this song
Motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Beanie Mac]
Black Friday management, and Roc's the label
And I still hit you niggas with shots that's fatal
That bullshit vest can't save you
I had a doc open you up from chest to navel
See my face on cable, and have flashbacks of that cold ass table
And them hoes I gave you
I'm that nigga that'll come and pour salt in your wound
At the hospital, while the cops guardin your room
You gotta see what I've seen, look where I've looked
Touch what I've reached, and take what I've took
You gotta go where I've gone, walked where I've walked
To get where I'm at to speak what I've talked
You gotta lay where I've laid, stay where I've stayed
Play where I've played to make what I've made
You gotta move what I've moved, use what I used
Use tools how I use, use fools how I use

Ay-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day
Said we're lookin' for a brighter day

Yo, I speak in whole beat legends
Divide it up in parts and sections
Days I was ministerin' sectors
Direct from the spot, forgotten on your election
Jail laced with fragments, speech clipped with accents
Phenomenal ave and for future and the past tense
Blew up the room in my absence
Live or closed caption watch my song vibrate with passion
The response in action to light bulb irrations
I come from where anything can happen and usually does
You find tension where it used to be love
I use my words to shine light inside the dark valleys
The dark alley, U.K., U.S., New York, Cali
From this king to all counties I out loudly
The clammer ? the chain of things that surround me
And seek bounty or stay stridin' and keep strivin'
I seek guidance, like the sun at the dawn I keep risin'
Like that y'all

Brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
Packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun

Yo yo yo nobody knows what tomorrow holds, could be pot of gold
Or a mere pot on top ya stove, still ya got to roll
Climb my obstacles and honor those who paved the harder road
Blazed the trails so a brighter day wasn't far to go
So many stories aren't told, so many lights that aren't shone
Still the world remain ignorant to what the heart should know
My love is audio, transmitted, heard, and felt
My words are mirrors to nearer and observe yourself

To receive (ceive), reflect (reflect), magnify
Let a bright light heal a damaged eye
We hold fort like family ties
Shout the battle cry and what we challenged by
Make the shady stand aside so ? risers can arrive
From native to the natural lives you can't deny the natural vibe
On a Mayfield natural high, artificials can abide
I love to see my masses rise
The joy to make your banners hot
The stronger people unite the way we lookin' for a brighter day

Brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun (move on)

Begun, brighter day, brighter day
Came away, came away and I flew away, flew away high, so high
I will fly (fly, whoa) fly away, fly away, fly away
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
We are lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Lookin' for a brighter day
Said I'm lookin' for a brighter day
Ay, ay

A brighter day came my way
Had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on (move on, move on)
That was the day that it all begun (yeah)

Brighter day came my way
I had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on
That was the day that it all begun

A brighter day came my way
I had to decide was I gonna stay
I packed my things and I moved on
That was the day that it all begun

A brighter day came my way
I had to decide was I gonna stay
Packed my things and I moved on
That was the day that it all begun

Verse 1:
When I walk up in a room niggas feel a slight breeze
Stay a little while 'till they feel they might freeze
Never understood why they never liked me
'cause when I lock the door they turn into iceys
Starin' at my feet all you see is Nikes
Bet you never seen a ill pair like these
Size Ten, never find me in a tight squeeze
At the airport minutes before my flight leaves
Round trip tickets to who knows where
Stay boardin' with never atleast a day's warning
Previous plans, they spoilin'
A dollar and a dream, the theme of NewYork state drawings
Rep from Saint Johns to Wake Forest
Wait for us, straight ballers
You're hearin' it first, Nate flawless
In almost every event puttin' up points
While niggas like you stay scoreless

Chorus 2x - (Nas and Nature)
All my niggas from the Projects light one up
To my bitches from the Projects light one up
And stay high....high...
And pass me a cup of that good shit
We on some hood shit

Verse 2:
It's like hoppin' in a glass pool half full
Niggas only hit the bottom when they crash through
Mash fools out like they fast food
Bone appetite
Whether Platinum or not it ain't no match for me
I sum niggas whole careers up
Scared tough niggas, bluff niggas into thinkin' that their years up
It ain't a game, I took since months off
Then shit jumps off
Mini me's are gettin' punched in they jaw
Some call this shit animal rap, me? I call it dumbin'
My nearsighted niggas saw it comin'
More stunnin', brand new flows to toy wit'
Neck flooded on some hurricane Floyd shit
Back and forth to Saint Croix kid, same plan
Playin' Sega Dreamcast to the plain lands, a changed Man
Niggas don't know, they never will
And if they don't understand then they ain't fam
Simple as that...

My homies call me on my mobile wanna hang we still close too

I write raps, make millions like that
I like that (hey yeah) really never was a rich man
A rubber band for a wrist band
Got dough and had to switch plans
Trouble still don't stop
The freeway getting chased by some bad missies
Wanting autographed pictures (oohh)
They want my name tattooed on them
Thinkin for a minute hit that ass make a move on them
Hey!  Hennessey with the chardonnay, mix it

Two shots in the air for my true thugs out there

Dont want no problem with you homie I mean none at all (not at all)
And to my rich cats with them big faced bills in the air

Cheap watches turned to Cartiers
Locals turned to gators
Point 3's turn to 5 c's all these car keys
Jump in the benz and hit The Shark Bar
You know they love to see a hot star

Chorus: Lil' Zane w/ variations

And for my dogs I ain't seen in awhile
I still got love for y'all ain't got a chance to return your call

I'm still hearing about drama poppin in the hood
Heard everybody doing good and i like that
Irv said y'all got the block locked
He tell me K and big Chris driving drop tops
Flossing I'm getting letters hard to write back
Put a fly picture in the mail hope they like that
Prayin that the fame don't kill us all
The magazines to the big screens
He ain't easy as the shit seems
Throwin up my dueces as a pass by
Showing love to the southside all the players outside
And we gon' spend G's tonight
Hotel's on me shit's free tonight

Come on, huh
Come on, yo, yo, yo
Some people blond peeps, red banjies
Some are moving quickly, outta town
How they gonna find her moving swiftly?
Five steps ahead of the best so that's nothing
Twenty steps ahead of the rest they left stuck
And in they face not, what not?
I can't stand broads
Ridiculous niggas practice for the title ""hard""
Me pick of the litter
I was born to bubble y'all
Born to change game shit born to stand guard
Play games you left nameless, fame hard
Promise that it's never painless
Nigga be hard
Convinced that you can take over the Eve
Eat nigga let starve
Strong as a stallion maiden
You better dart
Is she feminine with pretty women friends all dimes!
Timberlands is how I like my men and all minds
Rough ryde you niggas hard head, soft spine
Pass the word
Must have the stacks to cross lines
Come on

[Eve]
Don't want your dough
I don't want your car
(Uh-uh)
Don't want your jewels

Yo a chick is a chick
A nut is a nut
And they always keep an attitude
Till you butter 'em up
Since I ain't gotta buy you stuff
Who gon' hold you down
If they try to run in here and tie you up
Now don't start flippin' it
Everybody know
We've been had dough
Y'all just start gettin' it
Money might make you grown
But you still need a dog to take you home
And make you moan
You ain't gotta see the bank for loans
All I do is party and bullshit like when Frank was home
And you got it all boo I got it all too
A four, five, and a six and they all blue
And I don't care what she think
If I offered you any ice love it'll be in the drink
And instead of talking 'bout what you got and all that
Just make sure when I hit you that you call back
Come on, uh-huh

[Eve](Jadakiss)
Don't want your dough

Yo, yo ay yo
One touch will make a nigga blush on site
Grown men create a crush, nails they bite
It's a game try to catch me but only if you can
It takes a lot to impress the bombshell to want a man
And it ain't about your dough baby Eve alright
Cause if Eve wanna fly away, Eve take a flight
Eve hungry for a meal baby Eve get a bite
You nice and you might get to see it daddy, tight

[Jadakiss]
Yo, yo, yo
I'm glad that you got it all
That's more for me
And I ain't gotta pay for the puss I score for free
And the same thing I pulled on them
I pulled on you
Come on now how you think I pulled your crew?
Got my own crib so you can't kick me out
I'll call one of your friends to come twist me out
If you know Jada then you know what Kiss be 'bout
Just for fun I hit the bank and pull fifty out, uh ah

[Eve](Jadakiss)
Don't want your dough
(Uh-huh)

Now tell me who want to fuck with us?
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I bang - and let your fuckin' brains hang, snitches
Fuck Marla Maples, bitches with riches
Who carry 22's, up in they hosiery
A black teller when my father bust and unloaded me
Think he just finished sniffin a ki, and dippin the D's
Don't hate me, hate Nicky Barnes for hittin my moms
Letting the condom pop, nigga I was born in the drop
Coke boil in the pot, shake the Feds
And bust shots at them street cops
Fuck yo' point is? My point is double fours at your fuckin jaws
Pointed, hollow point shit
Four-point-six, need I say more?
Or do you get the point bitch? C'mon

What type of nigga slang and bang in the streets? (Bad Boyz)
What type of nigga stay in the Trump for weeks? (Bad Boyz)
What type of nigga fly Bentley Coupes? (Bad Boyz)
Aim for the sky, cock the shit then shoot

Minks draggin on the floor - bangin on your whore
Suckin the croissant just examine it for flaws
Pour the Cristal on the way to trial, RICO law
Got a nigga head hurtin squirtin til they pull the curtain
Let the money drip dry, hundred dollar bills
Wipe the tears from my eyes, no love
Fuck y'all niggas, hope you die a slow death
As I coke-test and C. DeLores Tucker protest
Can't fuck with you weak rap niggas, witcha gay raps
Runnin 'round talkin this and talkin that
See me in the streets, tried to give me dap
Andrew Cunanan ass niggas
My two cannons blast niggas, ask niggas
Got me fucked up in the game, get your shirt stained
Keep your five mics nigga, give me the 'caine
Do the shit to clean my money dummies, gleamed the wrist out
Cop the pist-al, nigga, talk shit now, uh

Bling bling, it's a Bad Boy thing
Bullets heat-seekin, streep sweepin, with an evil grin
Watch you die, one love, one life, one Shyne
Y'all niggas ain't sayin nothin, like a mime
Every line, I live it, I write it with a pencil so niggas die
Of lead poison if they bite it, hate it but recite it
It's a G thang, me and Puff in St. Bart's set it off
Bitches walkin topless with G-strings, menage'
Bust shots at your crew, another charge
As the gulf stream fly through the fog
Make ya popular
Pockets filled with more high notes than the opera
Franklins on top of the - Jacksons
My nigga Ty leave you tired
Bad Boy, repsect it or die, coward

What type of nigga slang and bang in the streets? (Bad Boyz)
What type of nigga stay in the Trump for weeks? (Bad Boyz)

Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get your ass up, and let's get ill
That's right y'all, we more than rough, we callin your bluff
And when it comes to rhymes... (Brick City)

Yo, don't scandalize mine
I spent too much time
Straight talk with the catch to etch my line walk
Never fetchin for crime--Halt! Who goes there?

[Dove]
Yo, it's the squeeze of five fingers, puffin Smokey the Bear
Shinin black like Darth Vader caps, they on stare

While we rockin it, I'll rock in it (rock in it)
Like the little ball inside the spray can
Providing three coats for both child, woman and man

Yo, you got popped like a flick by that rivalry clique
It went - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!

It ain't my fault your ass is on the asphalt
Got your chin touched by my fam who though you brought harm, you see
I'm iced out like a glass of tea
Better yet, oatmeal cookies, y'all just rookies to me
Slidin' up and down the court, but I don't think you can D
Why try? Maseo be gettin high since Luke was Luke Skywalk'
Man, my topic of talk is sheddin shame all over your game
Like them shorties who claim that afrocentric lovin is the past drug
A life filled with (*GUNS*) that's what thugs love
Snatch you fast, wrap that ass in the rug of your choice
While it muffles your voice

[Dove]
Now when I'm swimmin through the joint, I put the funk on hold
Cause if you don't, you'll see the bubbles come up
We run up a tab and gladly add a little extra for miss
Flashy faces with bigger lips for that ass to kiss

[Pos]
Most crews are post-current while we're forever
Direct beats that's contagious, loved by all ages
Graduated from the you-and-I-versity
Of hard-hitters, for real

[Hook 2: Redman]

I got niggas in the streets that'll blast your ass for the shine
And get - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!
Yo, if you a fat chick gettin your fuck on tonight
Then go - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!
Yo, put your hands opposite to the ground if you're lovin our sound
Go - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!
Yo, and to my broke niggas on the corner holdin me down
Go - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!

[Dove]
Yo, I swear Tommy gonna get it, he done did me wrong
I had plans to buy more land, plant corn
Bust kernels on heat, work hard like wetbacks
Set backs is gonna get my ass to be hostile
Rockwilder the beat, top dollar defeat
Big money's make the big decisions
Keep hip-hop alive, it's just an intermission
Back to the second half of the feature flick
Dick stacks and fuck rap

[Pos]
I had a name for makin paper since paper mache
Now my dollar coins join pounds of yen for play
While you broke niggas reach drunk much quicker
You don't make enough bread to soak up all your liquor
Went from God to God damn

[Redman]
Damn God, you're killin it
Should incorporate it, invest half a mil' in it
Rap cats talk with no will in it

[Pos]
Soundin like they virtual
This joint'll hurt you, yo

[Dove]
Twas the night before Christmas and my crib got robbed
(shhh shhh shh, shhhhh) They did a job
Took all my goodies out from under the tree, except the CD's
Of shiny-suit rappers and flossin emcees
Who fail at takin it to rhyme degrees

[Pos]
Man, you know no wack poems get no play in our homes
You need to not get nappy with me
Or else we gon' ""relax your mind, let your conscious be free""

[Hook 3: Redman]

Yo, where my Wall Street niggas, if ya up in the stands
Go - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!
To my women that'll throw they hands against they punk-ass man
Go - oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh!

Ay yo I got a resolution
This year I'm playing right
No 6:15 this year, you can stay the night
We can go bowling, it ain't like before
Can't y'all see that I'm growing? I was so immature
I was young and having money
Having honeys come to the crib
Dig in their shit
And they couldn't get cab money from me
Some bad chicks didn't get past the bridge
I went to 1 Trump Plaza on their asses
No room service, just snacks and shit
Work with those Lil Debbies
And when you're done, get ready
The chicks I was fiending to smash
Let 'em lean on the cash
Will take 'em on long trips
Break 'em with long dick
There was no such thing as strong relationships
But I'm off that player shit
I need a chick that practice Tai Chi
That still can buy weed
And can give me some good head
And I'll make her a mami

They understand the dough, my ladies going

Promise you'll never let me go
Promise you'll never leave me
Promise we'll grow

The only thing Bleek spinning is
Them chrome wheels spinning on them new rims
Home, suspended from school again
I'm grown, still ill, ladies love the ve-hi-cle, like ""Bleek
Can I feel up on your wood and grill?""
It's a hood thing, wood grain, off the chain
She give me good brain
Love the way I push my slang
Calling my jack soon as they hop in my V
They catching contact, weed smoke all up in the weave
Bet your man can't do it like this, like this
I bet his wrists ain't bluish like this, like this
And I'm from Marcy, you catch me on anybody's block
Reppin' th-the Roc
Hoes, they all clock like:

I was the worst, I used to switch chicks every day
Had niggas mad, for real, like, ""I wish he was gay""
Cause they knew sooner or later hun was getting with Jay
Just a matter of time: she was getting with Jay
I'll have your chick in the summer tropics sipping on 'zae
Spitting up in the Pacifics, smoking spliffs in the shade
She used to love you, but she feeling different today
You used to smother her. Look at your honey slipping away
Consorting with hustlers, niggas that be giving her space
She said she feel free when she's around me
I'm letting her do her and, in turn, she's doing me
She on the phone with her friends like, ""How cool is he?""

I'm into bigger and better things Mr. Fiend
You want a hit? Give me a guitar and a drum machine
And the crowd will scream loud when the bass thump
I can smell it in the air, the smell is funk
{*cough cough*} Excuse me I gotta cough
Girl you wearing so much ice you could freeze New York
You're man must really love you, what does he do for a living?
(He works on Wall Street he's only home two nights a week)
That's when she said a little too much conversation
Think she want to indulge in lyrical masturbation
So I proceeded with the conversation, I said
Can I offer you a glass of Merlot Mrs. No Name?
(Let's get it straight huh, my name's Veronica)
She had the ass the size of South America
She said ain't you that kid that sing Guantanamera
Way before Ricky Martin sung ""Livin' La Vida Loca""
What hood you come from?
I was raised in Brooklyn, but did my studies in Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem?
Yup, that's short for New Jersey
Checked my watch it was a quarter to three
Slid to her crib when we opened the door
Her man was on the bottle waiting for her with the 44

[Wyclef](The Rock)
Now what it look like, it ain't really that
(It doesn't matter!)
So he cocked the gat at my top hat
(It doesn't matter!)
Are you crazy? You was married!
(It doesn't matter!)
Cause if you ain't sharin, people ain't carin
Come up in your hood and they take everything you wearin

Yeah that's when shorty walked up to her man
And she said I gotta go I can't be here no more
And she said this

[Melky Sedeck]
Take me home, to the place
I belong at the Refugee Camp
And the Booga Basement
That's where I live, oh

Come on
Yo Rock I sold like seventeen million records
(It doesn't matter how many records you've sold!)
Alright I'm with you, yo check it out
You wanna go get diamond rings?
(It doesn't matter if the Rock wants to go get diamond rings or not!)
Man listen, listen

Travel in a dark road

I need a chick when I come on late
She don't sweat it
Life in money is the answer
No more ?? expect it
So why you broke
And spend your plan I just deflect it
I'm like the crack in the 80s fullest the streets at least expected
Would like to stay hollow but I got a baby at home naked

Now every little thing that we do (that we do)

The freaky things that we do (that we do)
Let's keep between me and you (me and you)
Cause every little thing that we do (that we do)
Should be between me and you (me and you)
The freaky things that we do (that we do)
Let's keep between me and you, ba-byyy

Yo...
Now when I first met her all I thought was ""Thong thong-thong""
Like, ""Lose the lame, we can get our freakin on""
Baby know the game, slip away, and slide me yo' number
It's the last day of spring, see you first day this summer
I'm a bad motha; shut yo' mouth! Pull the drop out and
Creep at a low speed, cause homey probably know me
I push the pedal, thoughts of your stilleto
Way up in the air like I think he's here
Cause see, every time that I'm alone with you (with you)
Homey be checkin up on you (on you)
But if that nigga only knew (only knew)
You've got a lot of freak in you, ba-byyy
Well now it's startin to rain, I pop the roof and the champagne
How Jay said? ""Money Ain't a Thing""
It's been close a few, at times even impossible
But, it's been between me and you, ba-byyy

Girl it's on again, every year - we hummer 'em in
Beaches, houses, hoes, foes, friends
And when the, day ends - that's when it all begins
You wit him? Here's my room key; holla at me
While you thinka-think I'mma hit it up
Then look at the nigga you thinkin you love? C'mon love
We could go there, me and you, creep off all night
If you love it, in the mornin, awake with new light
If you lookin like I ain't gonna handle his
Let me handle my bizzz, it is what it is
Nigga livin his liiiife, and that's my bitch
You know I gotta wiiiife, let's keep this thing tight, ba-byyy

Chorus

[Ja Rule]
Don't let the word get out (shhh), ba-byyy
This is - strictly between me and you, ba-byyy
If they - knew we were doin what we were doin it'd probably ruin
Our creep away summer in Cancun'n-and I, love
The way we get away, throw away a whole day
Turn off the pagers and phones, we in the zone like
""Fuck liife, we live liife
This is our liife, live your liife""

Shit ain't the same no more, turned for the worst
Streets got deeper, fuck my cell phone and beeper
Keep away from the limelight, get a grip
Get mind right, the Fed's trying to indict

From here to Pluto, we like Popeye and Bluto

I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the - down to the, to the flo'
Then I wanna, ""ahh ahh"" - you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know: what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?

[Verse 1 - Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the 50 yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree
And if you like in the club, we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked, don't knock while the boat rock
We go-bots and robots, so they got to wait til the show stop
Or how about on the beach with black sand?
Lick up your thigh then call me the Pac Man
Table top or just give me a lap dance
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
That man Ludacris (woo!) in the public bathroom
Or in back of the classroom
How ever you want it, lover-lover gonna tap that ass soon
See I cast em and I passed em
Get a tight grip and I grasp em
I flash em and outlast em
And if ain't good then I trash em
While you stash em, I'll let em free
And they tell me what they fantasy
Like up on the roof, roof
Tell your boyfriend not to be mad at me!

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit; you give it up till they go out
Or we can do it on stage at the Ludacris concert
Cause you know it got sold out!
A red carpet dick it just roll out
Go ahead and scream, you can't hold out
We can do it in the pouring rain
Running the train, when it's hot or when it's cold out
How about in the library on top of books?
But you can't be too loud!
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Try to make them turn the lights out
Champagne with my campaign
Let me do the damn thing
What's my name, what's my name, what's my name?
A sauna, jacuzzi, in the back row at the movie
You can scratch my back and rule me
You can push me and just pull me
On hay in middle of the barn
Rose petals on the silk sheets
Eating fresh fruits, sweep your woman right off her feet

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ludacris]
I wanna get you in the back seat, windows up
That's the way you like to fuck
Clogged up, fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Rough sex: make it hurt
In the garden all in the dirt
Roll around Georgia Brown: that's the way I like it, twerk
Legs jerk, overworked
Underpaid, but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Maybe your girl and my friend can trade
Tag team, off the ropes!
On the ocean or in the boat!
Factories or one hundred spokes!
What about up in the candy store?
That chocolate, chocolate make it melt
Whips and chains, handcuffs
Smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream ""help!"" Play my game!
Dracula, man, I'll get my fangs
Horseback and I'll get my reins
School teacher, let me get my brains

Blaze up, hate to ball and bail
Got some late cut, she sure now how to shake her tail
The way I hit it, make her wanna break up
And leave her man, make up
And cheat again, caked up
Lay low, Comfort Inn, tucked her in
Next week she said she'll bring a friend
Come on

She said I love my man, man man man
We got our ups and downs and I'll get lonely and, and and and
Wanna move move to someone who might understand, stand stand stand
How to make a girl feel like Alice in Wonderland...wonderland...wandered in
Wonderin'...if she can home with guilt on her mind
Really all she truly wants to know is that she still fine
After day you met her, better tell her, 'fore another feller

Khaki's, french braids wrapped up, all keepin' it true
In the G-yes when you see us
We won't dub any BS that wanna see us, get dommed up
A-team's on the hang like you bang for years
Main bitch and I ain't switch, bring 'em to tears
High pitch, like Eddie Kendricks when you hit an appendix
His and her's semi's regulate the problems we finish
Taught me how to grind, separate my nickles from dubs
G wit' it when you winning, so I'm showing you love
Had to check a broad yesterday for grilling you down
Shut it down quick cuz me still wanna see these rounds
Any beef you got, trust we gon' eat it together
Hold it down in the hood while I get this chedder
Whether it's all grits or gravey, are we ready to tangle

We gon' look up at the stars, notice those stars
They moving inside us, to get us it's gotta meant war
And as for them broads, you know the rules
It ain't a chicken alive that can walk in my shoes

Spinning the bottle, quarter mill', want a meal

You gon' ruin your rep
Trippin' while we pimpin' these hefers
Playa lectures got me shining like a new Gator stepper
Must have been mad
When your ho put my stuff in the dash
Bust in her ass
To climax I come up with a nab
The game don't stop
Legit ballers bending up the block
Niggas rushing, coming at us cause of status and props
Sucking and fucking, loving it when I put tha dick up inside her
Can't help it if she in love with a ridah

[Hook: Missy]

[Jay-Z]
Yo, yo
Why you home alone, why she out with me?
Room 112, hotel balcony
How she say Jay you can call the house for me?
There's no respect at all
You betta check her dawg
She keep beggin' me to hit it raw
So she can have my kids and say it was yours
How foul is she? And you wifed her
Shit, I put the rubber on tighter
Sent her home, when she entered home
You hugged her up
What the fuck is up?
She got you whipped, got your kids
Got your home, but that's not your bitch
You share that girl, don't let 'em hear daddy Earl
It'll make 'em sick that his favorite chick
Ain't saving it, unfaithful bitch

[Hook: Missy]

[Memphis Bleek]
Yo how dumb the pimp?
I heard he trick
Bought a new five, maybe a six
Copped that for his new down bitch
And I was digging that down since '96 shit
Memph man I'll take your bitch
Let her do her thing, give brain in the whip
And you know how it go when it come to the hoes
She can do the same thing to the clique you know
Your ho chose, don't get mad at me
Got your wife callin' me daddy
Put her out on the street let her get that cheese
My bad is that your freak
But you know how a thug do
When a nigga hit that, it's fuck you
Keep it snug, tre deuce in the boot
Niggas wanna act, get a motherfuckin' slug too

[Hook: Missy]

[Jay-Z]
Cool out homie
You betta keep her away from my balling clique
Keep her out of nightclubs all in the mix
From hanging out with chicks who be swallowing dicks
From catz who order Cris play the floor with the Knicks
That can only lead to something unfortunate
Hot boy like Jigga man scorch your bitch
Play the floor dot Jigga man go first
Then we all rock cause we all hot
You know the boys from the Roc got them whores on lock
Got them bitches in the smash
Make their drawers drop fast
Cause we get more cash than the average nigga
All dem hoes like damn I gotta have this nigga
Cause I'mma hot black, how in the hell can you stop that
You would fuck mine
How the hell can you knock that?
I'm just playing the cards chosen me
Jigga man who ya supposed to be?

[Intro: Rikrok (Shaggy)]
Yo, man
(Yo)
Open up, man
(Yeah, what do you want, man?)
My girl just caught me
(You let her catch you?)
I don't know how all of this happened
(With who?)
The girl next door, ya know?
Man, I don't know what to do
(Say it wasn't you)
Alright...

[Hook 1: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me redhanded
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key?
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

[Verse 1: Shaggy]
How ya fi give ya woman access to your villa?
Trespass and a witness all the hackling on the pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best review the situation that you caught up inna'
To be a true player you've to know how to play
If she say a night, convince her say a day
Never admit to a word what she say
And if she claim a yuh, tell her, baby no way

[Bridge: Rikrok (Shaggy)]
But she caught me on the counter (Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa (Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (Wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (Wasn't me)
Hears the words that I told her (Wasn't me)
As the screams get louder (Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

[Hook 2: Rikrok]
Honey came in and she caught me redhanded
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Banging on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

[Verse 2: Shaggy]
Makes you know say that she really no right for vex
A never you she see a make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else a favor you inna di complex
Seeing is believing so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the little evident you betta know fe mask
Quick pon yuh hansa, know how fe talk
But if she pack a gun, you know you betta run fast

Wanna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listening to your reason
It makes no sense at all
People tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost

Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh
Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh!
Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh
Oooh noo-ohhh, noo-ohhh!

Chorus: Chaka Khan (repeat 2X)

It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin like you think they should - it's all on you

[Chaka Khan]
I don't care about what you think you see
The things you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, cause it's - all on you-whoahhha-ohhh-yeah

[Dove]
I wish that, you could be a little bit more upfront
Weigh the situation how you want (right)
The loving that you claim is just a four letter word
The third letter's inviting so visualize the verb
You curve thought waves when you're handling the candelabra
So you sitting on the baby grand
Transmitting like you're made of man
But you paint a funny face like a chick
When I see you I'mma tell you quick that uhh..

Chorus 1/2

[Dove]
I can't believe we built this large pizza pie together
No pepperoni
Yeah you wanted extra cheese, sometimes I gave you extras
How we divided slices like the Red Sea theory
I was Moses hopelessly scorned by your thorn zapora
Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror
But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that
I had to bolt from that, and left you dead in the sea
It's better for me, I'm satisfied with repping for D

[Posdnuos]
We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm
Now we back up in the spot, claiming never been gone
Niggas who cut us off, wanna reattach us now
(Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some #'s to dial)
Yeah I give that ass a number, and some lumber to pile
Now catch a curve from my kick (or show me loving by brick)
So stick to the same plan, don't come shaking my hand
Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand
Between us, it ain't all..

Chorus

[Posdnuos] You see them kids be scheming on what we done copped
[Chaka Khan] Always out there scheming!
[Posdnuos] They steady fiending for the moment they can get us off the block
[Chaka Khan] Why they always fiending?

[Posdnuos]
Your people might have your back, but you need to watch your front
Indeed, ain't nothing guaranteed

[Chaka Khan]
That's the truth! Things ain't goin like you think they should

[Posdnuos]
A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's
Alright then; here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here; keep a clear head
Trying to keep my pockets on stuffed - like deer heads
Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all DON'T FAZE
So mind your biz and walk away
Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

[Chaka Khan]
I don't care about what you think you see
The thangs you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been there and paid my dues
I can't change how you feel, cause it's all, on you-whoahhha-ohhhhh

Go tell the DJ to put my shit on
I'm keeping you niggas and bitches in jump from the minute I get on
Taking they shirt off, showing they tattoos
Screaming and hollering and all
Got the gift to come up with it
Put it together, deliver it, make them feel it, bitch I been on
Sharp like you pulled me out the pencil sharpener
Bad like that student in the principal office
Put rappers in coffins, they dive like dolphins
I'm the damnedest lyrical marvel you come across often
So watch yourself
Or fuck around and get beside yourself, I know
Go head though, bounce them titties
Shake that ass, drop that pussy but stay in line ho
Fuck I can't, cause you can can
Cocked up, head down, pussy popping on a handstand
Leave that pussy smoking
If you gon' do something then bend over, and bust that pussy open

Inside packed from the floor to the ceiling up
The building ain't big enough
I'm backstage bouncing, adrenaline building up
The pussy cutter, did I stutter
The heart flutter, make your woman drawers melt like butter
Down like Nelly, I'm hype like Belly
The rhyme seller, kick ass like Jim Kelly
Stand up, round out, boot up and frown
Tell a nigga if he wanna try it then bitch come on down
No sweat, no blood, no tears
And if I tell you it's the shit then, bitch that's what it is

Gimme my room, you grabbed my space
Look out you all in my life, watch out man
I'm ripping a solo, I jump in the show, the rest are no more
Threw lyrical bolos, head butts and rhyme elbows
Get off me; tip-toe, wild slow, wild softly
Hurry up, you might not be able to do that shortly

Where would I be without my baby
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
But every thug needs a lady

(Ja Rule)
Girl it feel like you and I been mourning together
Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a, part of me
Mind body and soul ain't no I in we (baby)
When you cry who wipes your tears
When you scared, who's telling you there's nothin to fear
Girl I'll always be there
When you need a shoulder to lean on
Never hesitate knowing you can call on, your soul-mate
And vice versa, that's why I be the first to
See Jacob's and frost your wrist up
Now you owe me, I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me

Where would I be without you (uh)
I only think about you (yeah)
I know you're tired of being lonely (lonely)
So baby girl put it on me (put it on me)

Yo, and I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me baby
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in July it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely
So baby boy put it on me

[Hook]

(Ja Rule)
Since we met it's been you and I
A tear for a tear, baby eye for an eye
And you know that my heart gon cry
If you leave me lonely
Cuz you not just my love you my homie
Who's gonna console me, my love
I'm outta control hold me, my love
Cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin to hurt my baby girl
If this was our world it'd be all yours, baby
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
Cause every thug needs a lady (yeah, yeah)
I feel you baby cause them eyes ain't lying
Wash away all the tears there be no more crying (baby)
And you complete me, and I would die if you ain't wit me
So baby girl put it on me

Bank shot top of the key
Hit you in the gut with this he-re

And smoke one four the broke one
Blow one for the poor one
Grab your cups pour the potion

Been a long time coming
In the cut long time gunning
Heat keep humming
Pass it to the point guard rookie
Out to stash chips last cookies
Then mash to the backyard boogie
Spending hunds' on my loved ones
Give a dose back
With the haterism hold that
You can find me in the back
Where they blows at
Off the yack and the Prozac
Where the homies and the hoes at

Now go and give her two thumbs up
For this little one cunt

And give me two more for the funk
Bang in the trunk out the window halfway
Roll em up hot-box

Feeling old school, steady bobbin'
Mouth full of cotton
So gone and bend a corner with me

Me young bandit, if you ain't know

Even before Cube scooped a nigga
Way back had the hay-sack
And had a pocket full of loot
Bump with the douche
Work in the hood
Heata' in the bush
And I used to hold a sack
Till a nigga got rich like Quarterbacks
Now I throw the sack

Still keep in tact
And in the coldasac

I thought this was America people!
Uhh, yeah, guilty until proven innocent huh?
That's how we workin huh? Okay
Before me there was many; after me there will be none
I am the one
Uh-huh, okay, I see how we playin

Yeah, I get it down - anxiously the public can't wait
Niggas had to have it way before it's release date
Jigga get irate, press get it fucked up
Took me one point eight but I had to get it straight
Get the CD, twelve inch vinyl, get the tape
Jigga give out food for thought dog, get a plate
I get it down, get it crunk when I get in the state of mind
That what's mine is mine, nobody get to take
I don't bend, break, fold, scratch, go down
My mental rolodex see these words? I just don't know
I know stress, drama, niggas upsettin my mama
Arrested, put in the lineup, tryin to put dents in my armor
But I'm a survivor, plus I'm liver than most
Out on bail, fifty thou', still ridin with toast
I ain't tryin to collide with folk
But I don't want folk takin Jigga for joke
I guess you niggas just woke - good morning!

[Hook - R. Kelly]
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me.. what y'all want from me?
I'm not guilty

[Jay-Z]
I see how you comin at me now, I'm cool

I'm not the snitch I don't go to the cops to get rich
.. I go to the block and pitch
I go with the Glock and click, I go with the pop I'm sick
I go with you hard; I ain't gon' stop for shit
Look in my eyes dog, right in my pupils
If I'm your rival, why would I have to do you?
Press try to throw dirt on my name, disturbin my game
Seemed happy when they heard he was arraigned, glad he's indichted
Got big money, big lawyers to fight it
Just like Cochran, cocksuckers you never see me boxed in
Y'all all knnow it, Jigga's a fighter
Plus I'm claustaphobic, back on the streets before you know it
And my word niggas, I heard you niggas
I'm address each and every one of you cocksuckers
Fuck the white press, the block love us, hip-hop forever
B.I.G. is here, the soul of 2Pac hovers - above us

You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
Try to charge me but I'm not guilty
I got, all, my mamis
I've got all of my mamis
Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me.. (I am the one)
What you want from me? Not guilty

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, okay, you on my radar, I got you too bitch

Got lame bitches tryin to fuck with my case
Same lame bitch I bust in her face
Honey just mad I got her fuckin replaced
Plus a birthday pass without me even touchin my safe
But I ain't gon' lie, the head was sick
But what we need to do, is put that mouth on a betta bitch
You heard the rhetoric: ""Jigga hit me over the head
With a champagne bottle at the bar, can he buy me a car?""
Naw, how do y'all equate your pain
Would it all go away if I bought you a Range?
I got one or two of those, nothin gon' change
For nothin else, you gotta live with yourself
Try and lie on Hov' cause I ride on the road
In what, most would describe as a Rolls
NO, that's that Continental T
The only car that fit intercontinental me, not guilty

[Hook - R. Kelly]
You can't touch me, no you can't touch me
Jigga, Kelly, not guilty
And you wanna charge me, when I'm not guilty

Tell me, what you, want from me
Tell me.. what you want from me?

Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it

I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talkin shit
Best move cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

Where that nigga who be talking shit
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped her off and seen you fishing on your raggedy Brougham
Coulda thumped you in your dome (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya

As we leavin' the spot I'm still drinking
Gotta' leave cause the cops are still waiting
So we circle the block, as we workin' to blot
Then purposely watch - we so blingin'
And the truck is bright, light up the night
Blinking, as we stuck in the chair feel like we sinking
That sound still drowned the air waves
The echo in my head feel like a bear cave
So I sit back to the sound of this track
Playin' on my way home - I can't forget that
That beat when you hear from the street
Make you wanna get on the floor and don't even speak
Cause it don't even matter who be around
Get.. and that's DJ Keith - playin' that sound (I need that)

Knowing my baby loves me
Home wit tears in her eyes
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin her lies
She ain't surprised at me
She just surprised that we
Been together for this long
And I can be
The one to mistreat her
Thought it last forever
Cuz if I cry, you cry
We cry together

[Hook]

[Ja Rule]
From, what I recall we was little niggas
Cuttin school gettin high wit da hottest bitches
Livin, life so free, that we ain't fearin
The, ills of the world, in heat of drug dealin
You and I then made a killin, and stuck together
In this land of forbidden treasure
Love is the only evil seed that could sever
A tie this close
Not the love between us but your love for the dough
You went O.T. started makin M-O-N-E-Why
All my good niggas gotta die
But shit could last forever, I wish death was pleasure
Cause when you died, I cried, we cried together

[Hook]

[Ja Rule]
Wash away your tears (my love)
You ain't gotta cry no more (my love)
I put it on everything that I love
And my pain it's my love
And I want, this world to smile for me
Don't shed a tear cause the nigga died happily
My momma warned me life was a motherfucker
But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin
And every night she just looked at me
Tears in her eyes and they be saying shit like
""I don't want me baby to die""
Brought so much pain to her life
Gotta make it better
Cuz when ma cried I cried
We cried together

[Hook]

[Lil' Mo]
Oooooohhhh
You cry, then I cry
Then we cry
When he cries
I cry together, together
When I cry, then you cry
Then we'll cry, together
Baby, cuz when
Ja cries, Mo cries
We'll cry, together
If he cry, I'll cry
Then we'll cry, together

He really really really got to gut me
He really really made me scream and shout
He really taught me how to work my body
He really taught me how to go down south
He really really tried to hurt me hurt me
I really love his thug and gangsta style

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo we got chicks in the living room getting it on and
They ain't leaving till 6 in the morning
""O"" is for oochie
Oh you ain't know how many O's in the bankroll
Sort of like the game show, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
But my name ain't Regis
Nas the one they call when they want their thing beat up
Honeys with bodies with Bravehearts, guns in the party
Waves, braids, and baldies, trademark's the army
Is that Horse? It must be, I heard he husky
Yeah, there go Jungle, eyes red looking for trouble
And that's Nas dancing with dimes but who his man is?
The imperial thug, it's cold D Grand Wiz
We taking honeys to the crib tonight
Guarantee we gon' get up in they rib tonight
Check the new slang, it's changed, the Braveheart gang, man
When you see me pass then holler oochie bang bang

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz]
Yeah what up ma
Take a look, you hypnotized
On how my long dick stretch your insides
For real ma, with your thick lips and thick thighs
Stroke both holes, pass it to Nas
Or pass it to Naish, or pass it to Jung
Or pass it to Horse, then that ass getting tossed
Fuck a Hustler book, Penthouse or Black Tail
I got bitches sending my niggas flicks in jail
I fuck a bitch face more than her waist for real
And ain't no pussy like new pussy that's how a nigga feel
Bust three times, throw her the peace sign, she sleep
Then my dick sleep and I ain't gotta call her for weeks
Long leg hoes, mo'head hoes, married bitches
Me and my dog fucking them both they got us switching
Is the nigga gangsta? Yeah, that's how I'm living
That's how I'm playing - I got these freak fucking hoes singing

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jungle]
Little young thing go around my dick with your tongue ring
Deep throat my nine inch, gut from the front and
Grind from the side and fuck from behind and
Grab her hair slap her ass, she screaming like she dying
Make her cum four times without even trying
I'll beat that pussy up there's no denying
Hit her where she doodie at, make the booty fat
Little cutie rat walking by with the doobie wrap
Tight blue jeans, Air Max, small Gucci bag
No loot and no job, stay home giving blow jobs
Like no prob, it's simple
Holla out the window it's the project nympho
Fuck my whole crew, you know how we do
You got that good pussy I can share with my people
Be a brave girl, do your thang
Let them titties hang, I'll have all the bitches saying

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Horse]
When it comes to sex I'm similar to the Thriller in Manilla
Bitches call me Horse the pussy filler
I'll fuck a big boned or slim chick
Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
Ain't no sleeping in my bedroom when Henny's in my dick
When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch
Deep throat, ceaser gold or pun wicked hoes
Who like the way I thug and the way I flow
I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
Like Nia Long in a cherry thong with the lights on
Sipping Perignon with Kelly Price on
I pull out my python, I hit it while my wife's gone
Long dick the bitch all night, I'll make her pussy sing the song

No need for cappin this
Brave boys, I break your back with this
Practice, math this, lyrical theatrics
You'll never, ever, brave the weather, I'm too clever
Conjurin Sandstorms, I'll freeze ya, then I'll melt ya
You know I dealt the, on impact, shots hit the ceiling
These lyrics, I'm wieldin, straight echoes through the building
Enemies efforts are foreseen in the mental
I make steel wrinkle at the blink of an eye
Terminate unrighteous conscious states
Imitate the stars, while they constelate
The heart rate, of my social eloquence, makes sense
Intense, with the roughage, you couldn't budge this
Mountainous, type of figure
So check it out, now you know
When you lookin at a real nigga

[Hook]
You know we rip it up, hit the mic like a virus
We never hide this, unique rhymes styles is righteous
Who wanna battle, which rapper thinkin they the nicest
Straight up and down, these rhyme styles is priceless

[GZA]
You eggshell niggas get cracked in half
My armed force throw a road block in your path
Beats smash, from True Mast, my shots blast
Shatter glass, crowd watch the sound sets clash
Quick fast, I let the darts off, with no doubt
Your bitch ass, you head north and break out
Snakes out, hissin, shots missin
Observe, and respect and listen
And if you get stung twice, that means he's rollin wit loaded dice
It's like gettin stabbed with ice, and watch the evidence melt
Immediately the blow is felt
Commissioner revoke the belt, the microphone
Microphone flow-er, fresh show-er
Of the rugged garments, break the bread like Noah
I'm holdin, ride the 808 Roland
Write til my hand's swollen, your no comp ya
Huh, I stomp ya, the monster
Worldwide record launcher, multiply and conquer

[Hook 2X]

[Afu-Ra]
Nemesis, bringer of disaster
With more moves then the Tai Chi Master
Killa and I get illa, cerebral warlord
My name's Afu-Ra, step too quick, and your thought's floored
Fury portrayed, sharper than a fuckin cactus
Conquerin globes, and universes with Galactus
Tongue lashes, it rattles, never sliver
Optimus Prime, fatal bites as I deliver
Lyrically deadly, mic flow heavenly
In dwellin intelligence, choose my weaponry
Battle strategy, bishop cover angles
Knights move next, L shapes the vortex
Forces break down, now I got the nitty gritty
You think it's a stalemate, but now I'm yellin checkmate
Ultra rhymer, stop breaths like anacondas

No, it can't be! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Yo.. yo, gimme some room I'm throwin elbows
Timberland boots, Air Force and shell-toes, who the fuck is them?
If I gotta pay to get in the club
I'ma go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten
I ain't on the guest list, I ain't V.I.P
I snuck in the exit, learned to D-I-P
My dress code is all black when I'm makin the moves
Similar to the new Playstation 2
I can't help it if the club only packin a G
And the fire marshal wanna shut it down in 3
And you ballin ass niggas, whose dressed to kill
For the hoes showin the toes with extra heels (man!)
I gotta get in, I drove here
With a carLOAD of bitches charged on Belvedere
My niggas hit the cells if the line is thick
So I drive the 500, through the door of the bitch

We gonna bumrush The Tunnel, with a pound of weed
Cut the light on, you see it's Brick City in here
Blazin like Biggie passed us a semi in here
Don't sleep, stay wide awoke
You dialed Doc, not dial-a-joke
Crawl or you'll die in smoke
I keep it heated when the hawk is out
Seated low Tahoe, beat it when the dark is out
I'm outside of the line and I'm actin a fool
Like a three o'clock bully, waitin after school
(Punks!) I've been in this line for hours
I even killed the time by helpin my man pass out fliers
Now all I wanna do is get in where I fit in
Shake my ass with the baddest pidgeon with her wig in
JUMP, MOVE, CRASH, SMOKE, DRINK
Shake that ass stank, the fuck you think?
Poppa Bear at the table, and the porridge is pourin
Since +Def+ is the label I belong in a morgue!
I'm walkin half-dead, actin senile
With bigga niggas from jail than the one on ""Green Mile""
I'll huff and puff, blow the club down
I'll snuff a duck, I'm headed Uptown

And I was already on fish and spaghetti

Attack like a vulture, see what I told ya?
Said I'd get'cha, wear it if it fit ya
Y'all thirteen inches, I see the big picture
If it's to get richer, I'd probably get wit ya
If not burn it, get hot like a furnace
Shoot the video, motherfuck city permits
We own the city, on the phone with Diddy (*phone sounds*)
Red bone pretty, when she get aroused
Like to suck her own titty; put it in the video

Creep with your people
Though my shit is Sweet and Low it's no Equal
Front but you lookin
Once I throw the hook in proceed to get cookin
With the game when I sewed it
Since you came thought I owed you one
Wide big Lincoln, why's this guy on the side for the stinking?
Watch task force dash forward lookin marveled
It's a big chance, big pants, might guard him
With my man's type proper
Better learn quick, cause my clique don't argue
You ain't my crew, who are you? Beat it
'fore we take off make sure you all seated

Put the high score up
Then tear the floor up
On the world tour with your whore out in Europe

Tired of putting broke niggas under the wing
If I go to jail again I'm goin under the bing

Least God and the sun love us, it's the Sun God

[Verse Two]
Everywhere is broken glass
Nephews smokin squares, nieces smokin grass
Try not to say shoot around my daughter, she already know the blast
Catchin the future, don't know who threw the past
It's the, year of the snake and the hidden dragon
Niggas is fake like bitches braggin
Listen to the ocean and the stars, keep my vision in motion
In motion like cars
I'm down to Earth, at times I feel closer to Mars
The world is yours, I'm hopin it's ours
Some say the Gods is crazy, I see God in our babies
Child of the sun, I allowed it to raise me
(.. from a distance) niggas tried to appraise me
I'm hard to read like graffiti so it don't phase me
My days be spent, behind dream's tent
Through the sun the divine being is sent
It's the Sun God

[Verse Three]
Letters from prison sayin we need a better religion
I'm a rebel that listens from a eighty-seven position
I can't crystalize the mission lies within
Born to die even in death we begin
It's heavy 'jo learnin what we already know
And carry low swing on a chariot slow
Brothers stick though remindin me of revolution
If the drama comes I'mma have to uhh pop his gun
It's the Sun God, yeah

Hung your shoes from a telephone wire

Yo, let me tell you how I pursue
Spit game in they ear, and it's proper too

Hit the beach, forget the sheets

Y'all think y'all know my aim
That's a joke like Marlon Wayans, lame
And it ain't got no change

If you a flea be a flea
Uh swimming in the sea
You talkin' about my bag of forty back to eternity
Drinkin' my drink in the morning like Mo, Hen, and Chiney
Fast to understand a lyrical blast, can you see me

[Verse 1: Freddie Foxxx]
Somebody better call security it's 'bout to be on
I'm in the streets, midnight, 'bout to bust 'til dawn
Niggas are dead wrong, if they think I'm soft in my song
You wanna die? Hah, I can help your coffin me on
I'm the reason that some rap niggas, may spit a name
I'm the reason that some niggas, still in the game
I'm the reason that rock died, some proclaim
Rich underground street nigga, Bumpy came
They wonderin, how the hell he just won't stop and
They wonderin, how this nigga stays so hot
Well it's a combination of five things I live by
I don't speak to none of these bitc -ass niggas, just give eye
Always aim for the sky, unless I'm aiming at an A&R from the majors
Then I aim for the eye, and you never seen me cry
These emotional ass industry rap motherfuckers
Nigga just push double Y
And I always spit fly, and never be afraid
Cause Bumpy ain't leavin, 'til Bumpy get paid
You niggas is like little AIDS
Infecting the sound that the real niggas started
So we keep it underground, yeah

Got me clouded brains in motion

[Verse 2: Freddie Foxxx]
Niggas know I ain't play around when it comes to the rhyme to the sound
From the sky to the ground, I gun your ass down, like I'm aged rap round
I got a little game for the kiddies and I call it ""Ain't that clown!""
It's Bumpy Knux, hotter than grits on Al Green
Gonna make Allen Iverson stick with his team
Basketball was your dream, so live ya other life
Don't go broke tryna flow, be you ain't that nice
What's with these basketball niggas, I'm screamin' double dribble
How you nine foot tall, and rhymin just a little?
I police the underground, and I'm thug appointed
Got a problem with that speech get your mug annointed
By reverend Glock, niggas got they' game all twisted
It's a lot of niggas I'mma bring it too and it's listed
I hope he try to stand up and show me you live
That makes my dick hard, and I get all sweaty inside
Cause I know this little nigga wanna prove he ain't a sucker
But he fucking with a bad motherfucker, it's Bumpy Knux

[Hook] [2x]

[Verse 3: Freddie Foxxx]
The magazines - I like to meet my reviewer
Take his ass to the sewer, and show him what it's like
Tryna come up on this mic, how to struggle, how to fight
It's like tryna find an ass on a Chinese woman
In the dark, black night I got the double Tech
As if I was in the cigarette smoke
And skinny white women they play my record
I been +Hot+ since +97+, way before that
Now I come back, and niggas still bitchin
You can't even snatch a chain no more, niggas snitchin
A lot of niggas is just pots in the kitchen like congresman Wrangle
Mister Bo Jangle with fucked up ankles
The blacks start suffer while the white start spangled
Banner and we don't play on MTV
The fuckin record company is ownin all the MP3
And the bootleg factory, I got niggas saying ""Bumpy too black for me!""
It's the truth nigga, I see, but you blinded by glitter
And you got a little cheddar what's made your pussy game better
While you need mic nice lessons nursery rhymin
When all a nigga want is a car and a hurt me diamond
He'll do anything for anybody
And suck a dick like he MC Lewinsky
I'm the nigga that you can't see, don't ever get it fucked up
All you sucka ass niggas will get Bump knucked up

Verse 1 :
Like when Janet was Justice that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
A shorty that can tell you when the J's come out
Get creative with they haircuts like T-boz
Fav'rite rappers is Bow Wow, Snoop, JD, & Nas
Always up in they sombodys face tryin to fuss
And to get where she goin she can take the bus
Like when Jada was Peaches in the movie Shame
Or the type you can find sitting at a Ruckers game
Only like dealing with cats that love to floss
Only like rocking the stuff that really costs
Lip gloss shinnis' tattoos on her back
Attitude like Mary J. Mixed with Brat
You can find a man at a beauty shop, mall, or church
Name brand head to toe with the matching purse
So all that siddity stuff, ya'll can keep
Cuz only girls that keep it ghetto get to ride with me (fo' sho)

(Chorus)
Ghetto Girls
That like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball wit the best of them
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixen up the bomb Kool-aid
Ghetto girls that think they can hang
And talk more slang
Than I do
Ghetto girls that's all I like so tell me baby is that you

Verse 2 :
When they ride with they man like you won't believe
Switch the color on there hair like Eve
When they talk like I talk but walk like a lady
Snap lile I snap and get a little crazy
I love that especially when they bout the cheese
Type that won't front for some Mickey D's
Bandanas to barrets daisy dukes to spandex all thats good with me
I like em' G-H-E-T-T-O now believe me she gots to go
At the corner store buying up all the sweets
From Choo Choo's to Rice Krispy Treats on my street
That's all I see like everday
And they do what they do in a crazy way
Hang with the ballers so they never pay
And they usually got a name that's hard to say (ya heard)

(Chorus)
Ghetto Girls
That like hot boys that push hot toys
And ball wit the best of them
Ghetto girls that rock braids in different shades
And in the kitchen fixen up the bomb Kool-aid
Ghetto girls that think they can hang
And talk more slang

Ghetto girls that's all I like so tell me baby is that you

Probably treat this chick, mo' betta

Poppin' my collar, patnah - who in the spot?
Baby, Rule in the spot; and the mug and the watch ugly
Half the hoes hate me, half them love me
The ones that hate me only hate me cause they don't trust me

Bigger dick, I don't know, must have been the best flow

But fuck that, I put alotta money up, I'm hatin!

Aiyyo you killed me with that
""Who bought this?"" I bought that
Knowin damn well in reality you bought jack
You ain't lift one finger, but you claimin what's yours
Runnin all through the house, bugged out, slammin doors
We used to dress like twins - sweats, baby blue Timbs
You even scratched my Benz, let the pigs in
You think that I'm the biggest bird in America?
Catch me on TV, I'm come back, never the...

The sun that didn't shine
I'll blame it on the wind
The sun that didn't shine (This is one of the strongest countries in the world)
I'll blame it on the wind (We gotta come together)
The sun that didn't shine (In the time of this tragedy)
I'll blame it on the wind
The sun that didn't shine (This is real y'all)
I'll blame it on the wind

(Verse 1: Cash)
Hey yo, just the other day
I turned on the tube
I couldn't believe what I seen on the news
What was on the mind of these ignorant fools?
The cold blooded massacre, innocent people
All the fireworkers from Battallion Nine
The EMS unit cops lost in the line
My duty, my heart goes out, yours truly
This is like something you see in a movie
But it's real
The pain us Americans feel
A girl worked just a few blocks from down here
She made it home safe, thank God she still here
Get on your knees, close your eyes and prayer
We over here carin'
They over there scarin'
I hope that you're listenin', more that you're hearin'
Shoulda saved the price for squad's to unite
For the Afro-American, Latino, and white
If it was all wrong, I guess now we right
There's no time to run, now it's time to fight
Instead of the Twin Towers we gonna build triplets
And show asperity to them evil ass snipples
It's on

(Chorus) x2
The sun that didn't shine
Don't blame it on the rain
To all those that lost their lives
In our hearts you will remain

(Computa)
No way, you ain't comin' in here
It's America jerk
We make you disappear
Throw your flags in the air
Salute, put your guns up, retaliation
Show the world we form as a nation
No hesitation
We bomb first
Make you eat dirt
How that taste
When you wake up with guns in your face
Now you singing the same song we sung
Too late, the bell rung
Now you can't stop the land of the free
Home of the prophet
Never lay down for no one
Represent the warriors
We are as people
Show 'em the flag, flash 'em the eagle
That's the stamp we all carry
Black, white, Puerto Rican
Son whatever it be
We all married
Send the ships and the planes in
Bomb if we must
And remember, we doing this for the lives they touched
And ruined
Families left, empty spaces
Daddy's gone now
You motherfucker's got balls
And we love to break them
You cowards fucked with the wrong country
You brought the smoke, now it's time for munchies
Uh, What!

(Chorus) x2

(Cash)
How could you think murder is the will of Allah?
Jesus Christ, Jehovah
Man I gotta say nah
While I'm at it Rest In Peace Aaliyah
Dame dash, hold your head I feel your pain bay prah
Gotta, live every day like there's no tomorrow
This terrorist attack was a hard pill to swallow
This will change our thinking for rough times to follow
Dupe

(Computa)
Just to think about the nights my neighbor lost sleep
His brother gone to a tragic defeat
It's all about your heart now
Get your weight up
Form as a team
Be straight up
Fight for yours
Never down on your cause
Surrender
We here to twist apart the terrorists
Show 'em who's boss
Come here swallow this bomb
Cool off
Can't control your own people
After we rock there's no sequel
U.S. of A nobody's equal

(Females singing)
Oh it hurts so bad
Your love will be right here with me
Time is also sad
I know your shedding tears with me
Keep your prayer close
To God and He
He will understand
All your hurt and suffering

[Intro: Ashanti]
Always there when you call (Buckshots, ha), always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby

[Hook: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
Cause I can't wait no more
Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Hook: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparantly fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Hook: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

[Hook: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Outro: Ashanti]
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine

Do ya wanna roll, in my six fo'?
Let's have some fun baby, let's have some fun
Oh we'll get low (we'll get low) and dats for sho'!
And hop on dubs baby and have some fun, now check us out!

[Verse One: R.L.]
From when I met you at the roller rink
Cotton candy with her Shasta drink
Braced with caress that were white and pink
All the kissing we did, was on the cheek
Remember, like yesterday
We'd hop on our bikes and just ride away
Knew you'd be mine some how, some day
And I'ma say I do

Three, bottles of Moe', doe, models fa sho'
We havin a good time avoidin one time
Layin in the sunshine its all gravy!
Dipped it, hit a switch, what's crackin' baby?
Ride with me slide with a double-oh, sip on this moe'moe
Get your bubble on, bring your girlfriends
All y'all can come along

In the Cadillac beatin' up some Battlecat
Dogg youse a fool baby lemme handle that
Oh you don't drink so you don't think
You ain't gon' win you don't speak, you ain't no freak
Cause I can turn you, learn you and burn you up
Gimme the cup sit down and shut up!

Here we, here we go again!

I gotta Chevrolet, white walls and them
Twenty inch thangs in the coupe with Snoop
Gettin juiced orange juice top down
And feel the sun rays feelin kinda good right know
Right around my hood right now
Lookin for somethin to do like a barbecue
It's too hot to be in the house
A little bit of music and a couple of babes
A little bit of drank and a game of spades
Take your kids to your mama's house
Sure know what I'm talkin bout, it's about to go down!

Aight aight, I admit I'm type picky
Take trips to Cali, strictly for the sticky
I'ma get get it crunk anywhere I go
Why you smooth haters actin' like y'all don't know
From barbecue's to barmitzvah's

Come on pass that shit like that's that shit

Give you somethin you can feel, real recognize the real...

High is how I stay all the time

[Verse 1]
Welcome back, Based God; massive attack
Thank you for
Blessin' me with the present, in fact
Actually
How you rap makes the people react
I ain't seen it in a while, you a legend in flesh
Even to how you dress makes the silents guess
I ain't never wore a Guess, bitch I know what I want
Five-somethin' short dude with the presence of Dr. King
Ask about the boss from the summer to spring
They'll tell you that my name mean more than the phrase
I'm more than a game
And I kept on the fame
And I really been true, shit, like a counsellor
That's how I used to be, with the devilish stares
Quickly; that turned to the moment I'm in
Because I can't sit in jail, that was never my friend
Ask if I go back? I say ""never again""
Lil B in handcuffs, livin' life is a sin
I'm Black Ken

Shit, my life is a dream
I'm still a king

[Verse 2]
Most of it's bullshit
I don't relate to your foolishness
I'd rather deal with trendsetters
Man, I'm lookin' at my rap; now I'm proactive
Started writin' on a paper, changed my whole status
Bad bitches suck my dick now; no askin'
So fresh, goddamn I'm a closed casket
Anybody wanna know how I got it?
Switched my game up from a legend to a prophet
Stepped my guns up from a 40 to a rocket
The type of ammo that blow the cords out your socket
The type of new money you ain't puttin' in your wallet
I done seen the kind of cash you can't put it in your pocket
And I ain't with the secrets man, I let you know your option, man
Here's a guess: eighty percent of these bitches boppin', and
About twenty percent of 'em is your partners
The other half of 'em is imposters

Will you please show mercy on the child that's being abused?

But when I wanna go outside

Cause it ain't safe for the kids to play no mo

My relationship with them is not good
It's da dilemma
Momma's broke and she need some change
Or should I go to school or stay in
I don't know
Help the physician within me
Heal myself
For the sake of my family don't let me kill myself
I know that it's something that we all gotta suffer
But why you had to take my grandmother
I'm trying to keep my head screwed
In a bad mood

Can you please take time out to help ya boy
Cause they down hear trying to steal my joy
Was AIDS really a ploy, to destroy out of pope
That's what they saying
It's hard to phantom
Tell me they plan
Cause my friends in the hospital sick as can be
Fighting for his life against HIV
Now tell me how much longer can he last with his heart
Beating off life support
Can I please touch the hem of your garment?
Get on my knees and be cleanst of the torment
My heart is pure
But I think I'm at my limit
Cause every time I turn my back
I'm getting stabbed in it
Wait a minute before I end
Dear God will you tell me why I'm judged by the color of my skin
If you can please respond, a.s.a.p

For you to ever sweat the next bitch - with speed
I make the next bitch see the exit - indeed
Gotta know you're thoroughly respected - by me
You get the keys to the Lexus - but no drive
You get your own 2002, she through ridin
Keep yo' ass tighter than Versace
That's why you gotta watch yo' friends
You gotta watch me, they connivin shit
See I just wanna freak your body-adi-adi
I know you don't do this for everybody-adi
But everybody ain't as horny as me
And your body's - callin, me...

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, yeah
Mami shot through the pad with the Mark Jacobs bag
The thick stitched seam and her favorite ass jeans
Y'all know the first date wearers
To make objects bigger than they appear like a rearview mirror
Oh her shoe game is real
She gave 'em the Christian Louboutin's with the four inch heels
But honestly my favorite type of gear
Is a scrungy for her hair and LaPearla underwear, clear?

I got one question
Ya'll know me
Or ya'll been living in God realities
Or Gods with men mentalities
But uh..

Royalties from the kounty of kingz
Mama spoiled me, the neighborhood express loyalty
Raised all quarters, we go to the store for ya
My house, your house, we open the door for ya
See the pumas all white outside
Our playstation was right outside
I love the block, I couldn't fight outside
(?) the huffy with the puffy seat Calvin coolers
Parties in the basement, s-love
Hey what's up with the bad blood
Nearly is that us, it couldn't be the cars I lent you
You was locked down, was it dough I sent you
Outside now, do you have my pockets
Be friends with my foes
Wanna see me decompose in a six foot ho
Keep my eye on the (?)
But we grub from the same plate
Put five thorugh your clothes
But we come from the same place
That ain't gangsta, that ain't hood
That ain't street, that ain't good
It used to be picture perfect
Now my Canon can't even take snapshots at your frame
Which one of us is to blame when the ""Love is Gone""

[Hook]
Love changes (scratches)
Yo, respect game (scratches)
When the ""Love is Gone"" (scratches)
Love changes (scratches)
Yo, respect game (scratches)

I drop jewels for your DNA
I threw tools to you even to subdue your own DNA
A team around the way, but who will be the day
The rhyme or the grind, we always see stacks
But you be in my big ass cap, I'm see sack
Yeah, this song to the real, but it's real you feel
Still spinning, got them sea sick with the c-6
Problems, revolve 'em, eyes shut when i can see six
A sad sad song, people, no remix
Never again, forever my friends
Aiiyo, nothin out here greater than being calling daddy
But years later, women were bringing the law at me
Relationships thought i be spending them all happy
I'm rising, but you were sending the (?) at me
Every morning, nearly on beat the cops
Franklin and Myrtle, the crib over the pizza shop
Why you was missin, best believe I slept with rats

Okay, here we go

[Intro - Andre 3000 (singing)]
Yeah I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song, and I want y'all to sing along
Sing along
See this is the way that we walk on a sunny day
When it's rainin' inside and you're, all alone
All alone, yeah!

[Hook - (singing)]
Cause the whole, world, loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole, world, loves it when you make that sound
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole, world, loves it when you're in the news
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the whole, world, loves it when you sing the blues
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)

[Verse 1 - Andre 3000]
Take a little trip, hater, pack up yo' mind
Look forward not behind, then you'll see what you find
I caught a sucker dyin' cause he thought could rhyme
Now if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime
I gotta meet her, don't take no shorts I don't use abbrevi-
-ation, I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
I'm a cool type of brother but yep, your head I'll sever
From the neck - see ain't nothing changed, hit the stage
Set a date sucker, in battle we can engage
I'll slice you, wife you, marry you, divorce you
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
With my back against the wall, crack his back y'all
Naw, it ain't went nowhere like havin' hair with stylin' gel in it
Throw a curl in it
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
And this for them niggas workin' at the airpo't
Who got laid off, I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Because the whole, whole, world, world

[Hook] (overlaps with Andre's last line)

[Verse 2 - Killer Mike]
Player I grind, my focus is crime
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
My words are diamonds dug out a mine
Spit 'em, polish, look how they shine
Glitter, glisten, gloss, floss
I catch a beat runnin' like Randy Moss
Ride that bitch off like a brand new horse
I'm rollin' my stone, gather no moss
Mami I'm comin' I hope you get off
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Rap, roll, utterly rocked
With my mouth to the mic and my hand on my cock
Cadillac OutKast just won't stop

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Big Boi]
Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?
Debate, now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
Hate, extreme prejudice, let's dismiss this
If you want to you can dub it to your hit list
I know you goin' to, we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
When it come to this music we stay relentless
Pursuing all that's pursuable
Doing God-willing all things that are doable
The only liable limitation is yourself, Dre
Set it on the right and I'll set it on the left, cause

They was told not to ride in Patty's Hearse
And stay out of Charles' Manson
Took Abraham's Lincoln through the Todd Bridges expansion
Willis Reeds a map that marks the spot showin
On his left George Burns a blunt William's Holdin
Tyra Banked the money that Chaka Khaned the poor
Alicia Keyed his car for givin Melba Moore
For the Redd Foxx who bought off the block, but though twice
As Debora Cox the gun cuz she beat Kelly's Price
When Rosa Parked the truck on the farm that Kim Fields
Linda Tripped for tryna to walk in Lauryn's Hills
Water dripped outta Farrah's Fawcett in the glass
She was ""Superfly"", Curtis Mayfield her ass
Chris Tucker to a show, Ted Turner to a ho
Robert Diggs the beat, but ain't feelin the flow
But he signed it fast, for half of Johnny's Cash
Nia Longed for the album to drop, cameras flashed
Tom Sawyer at the Lucielle Ball up at the foyer
He confronted Richard Pryor to hiring his lawyer
Suge's Knight removed the rook off the board
Donna King was checked and Al Sharpton the sword

""Wettin cream, I ain't wettin fame""
""(Fame is the measure)
""Rap celebs""
""The place where stars are born""

[Verse 2]
The saints marched in, Kurtis Blowing his horn
Tom Cruised the boulevard, Chris Rocked the song
For the hundredth time, they pressed rewind to the beginning
They toast to the rhyme, the juice spilt from John's Lennon
They took her to Elizabeth Taylor to dry clean
The lone seamstress, who was schemin on Al's Green
You know they shoot for the stars and buckwild
Like the kids in the yard who play with Jane's Child
A beautician laced Erykah's Badu
Sean Combed through the evidence, just to get a clue
The needle in the haystack, from outta Eartha's Kitt
The Tiger would kill him once thrown in Brad's Pitt
Jesse Owen the money from the weed Bubba Sparxxx'd
They was journeys seen far as he walked in Dick's Clarks
Jeffery Lyons stuck with a thorn from George's Bush
Paul Pierced in the heart as the crowd pushed
Acting alone... Drew Barrymore bones
Of the victims, three blocks from Jim's Brownstone
They shared the same bowl, he caught Natalie's Coled
The producer, threw the butter on Esther's Rolle
Nipsey Russeled him down, got his jaw wide
In a instant, Brooke Shields him from the gunfire
Angie Stoned him to death, with those vocals
Keith Sweat from the workout, just from runnin local

"" Wettin cream, I ain't wettin fame ""
""Fame is the measure""
""Rap celebs""
""The place where stars are born""

[Verse 3]
Larry's Bird flew outta Nicolas Cage
Joe Tex messages from Satchel's Paige
Betty Wright letters with ink from Sean's Penn
Infinite bars, you couldn't tell where the song end
Glenn Close enough to quickly duck the tapes
Richard Gere ripped while he was climbin Bill Gates
He was a southerner, posing as a, native New Yorker
The Jason Kidd took his first steps in Jimmy's Walker
He stayed on line chattin with rap celebs
Used Bernie's Mack to search Veronica's Webb
It cost them their life for the advice you gave
Now Pete Rose lay on Vanessa's Redgrave

"" Wettin cream, I ain't wettin fame ""
""Fame is the measure""

Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxing them roads
When I was huggin' it, niggas couldn't do nuttin' with it
Straight from the oven with it, came from the dirt
I emerged from it all without a stain on my shirt
You can blame my old earth, for the shit she instilled in me
Still with me, pain plus work
Shit she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm calling guts every time, drag my nuts every time
Homey, we make a great combination don't we
Me and the Face Mob, every time we face-off
Face it y'all, y'all niggas playing basic-ball
I'm on the block like I'm eight feet tall
Homey, I'm in the drop with the AC on
That's why the streets embrace me dawg, I'm so cool

Face Mob, Mack Mittens and Hov'
Don't make me relapse
Back to the block with the four
Cause this street shit is all I know

From the womb to the tomb, a hot pot a jar and a spoon
Trying to make me forty thousand and move
Motels, star-studded, rock stars and goons
Plain clothes wanna run in my room
But nigga guess who's bizack, it's ya boy Face Mob
Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake dawg
Give niggas a break, nah; you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang for, to go against the grain, no
I'm out here in grind mode, wrapped up in the paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine ho and candy paint the 88
Don't got no wholesale, cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here take these five stones and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta see my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets fool
Money is an issue and that's on the fo' shizzle my nizzle
Ya block warm, and I come by with the fizzle
And make fo' sho' I get to work mines, a car at a time
We go to war and you ain't making a dime
Cause I got, shit to lose; a nigga out here paying his dues
My baby walking gotta get him some shoes
It's a new game brewin', lemme give ya the rules
Get outta line and I'mma give ya the blues
It's a new game doin', lemme give ya the rules
Get outta line and I'mma give ya the blues, whoa

Guess who's bizack
The boy B. Mizack, a.k.a. Mr. Crack-A-Brick
Turn a whole one from a half a brick, look I mastered this
You can smell it once the plastic rips
A hot plate'll make ya swell up if ya gas get clipped
You can make ya chips swell up, ya don't hafta pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watch the traffic switch
Young'n never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz
And keep ya whole hood on flip, like old box-spring
Pissy mattress shit, low old box of things
Strictly glassy shit, I hug the block like quarter water
Shit I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
Till like deuce in the morning, with the old heads
Slangin' loose quarters, this Philly cat back at it
Still fuckin' with them crack addicts
Still bustin' with that black-matic

[Intro: Jermaine Dupri + Ludacris
After the party it's the Waffle House
If you ever been here you know what I'm talkin about
Where people don't dance all they do is this
And after the original you know what it is
Welcome to Atlanta

[Verse 1: Jermaine Dupri]
Remix, it had to go down
I got somethin' else to tell you 'bout the new Motown
Where people don't visit, they move out here
And ain't no tellin' who you might see up in Lenox Square
I don't know about you but I miss the Freaknik
Cause that's where my city use to be real slick
People from other cities used to drive for miles
Just to come to get a taste of this A.T.L style
I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballinest Player
Make my own moves, call me the mayor
Monday night you know things change with time
Magic sittin' back lookin' like 89
All the homies on the southside up in the Ritz
Tuesday night, the Velvet Room same shit
Wednesday Strokers I don't go no mo'
Cause they don't know how to treat you when you come through the do'
Thursday night, was Plush but we moved the fuel
And I be up in the booth drunk actin a fool
Friday night, at Kaya they still got love
And the Sharkbar we poppin' like it's a night club
Saturday still off the heezy fo' sheezy
You can find me up in One Tweezy
Sunday gettin' me some sleep, please
I'm on my way to the deck then hittin' Jazzy Tee's, holla

[Interlude: P. Diddy]
Ayo, I'm from New York man!
Representin' N.Y.C. to the fullest
I pull it, Heads be duckin in New York be bussin
Take that

[Verse 2: P. Diddy]
Welcome To New York motherfuckers, where we don't play
And out of towners get got like everyday
And a gangstas a gangsta in every way
Sittin' low on 22's; this what long money do
Now the don's on it, Diddy shine on it
Tell Flex to run it back and drop a bomb on it
Sunday we layin' low at Halo, sippin' Cris and we straight
Monday we go to Bungalow 8
Tuesday I'm in spa drunk doin' the shake
And for the rest of the week we just follow the freaks
You can spot us out of town by the way that we walk
The way that we talk, cocky the state of New York
Hot now top down at the Rucker's game
New coupe, no roof playa, what's my name?
Now Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten
Uptown what now?! let's make it happen

[Interlude 2: P. Diddy]
New York, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere
We still here! And we buildin' four more new towers!

[Verse 3: Murphy Lee]
Who say St. Louis ain't hip hop? Dirty we hop to what's hip
I'm a lunatic with too much grip to let a slip
I'm so St. Louis, ask my tatooist
I was like ""The Waterboy,"" now they sayin, ""YOU CAN DO IT!""
I'm Baby Huey one of the best in the Louie
Sip Louie smoke louie, dressed in Louis
Home of back porches, Chucks, and air forces
Old school cars be trailblazin' like Portland
The girls are the best like Travis with fat asses
I call 'em gimme girls they always tell me I can have it
All got habits, marijuana to static
By two cats and coats with automatics
St. Louis, the truth like Sojourner
Don't need a burner we learn from Ike Turner
I tried to told ya don't cross that bridge
Without permission from the St. Lunatics

[Interlude 3: Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Ladies and gentlemen, we got the big Snoop Dogg in the house tonight
He just came from off tour
And he wanna tell y'all little bit where he come from

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg + Jermaine Dupri]
Palm trees, bad bitches and wannabees
O.G.'s like me eatin on pollaseeds
Now & Laters, jellybeans, and Wallabees
Real niggas from the set I hardly ever seen
Mostly heard, sell a bird off the cizzurb
And when we dip, we hop and then we swizzerve
A lot of homies like to wear the pizzerm
Hair longer than hers, sharp with the fizzur
Doggy Dizzogg, you know I like to bizzall
Like Kobe to Shaq now take that
Take that, take that
Long Beach is on the mother fuckin map
The city by the sea, R.I.P
JD, you know about the L.B.C
My niggas love the Steelers, cold hearted killas
Real cap peelas, real niggas feel us
Ain't no squeelas, a lot of dope dealers
Bang diggy dang dang Dogg Pound Gangsta Crip Gang
Yeah we do the damn thang
Go to Pomona, scoop up Kokane
Head to the church house to get a little workout
Smoke out, drink up, now put ya bank up
It's all on me I got a scenery to stank up
Crank up the beat, raise up the heat
I'm throwin' a block party on 2-1 Street, fo' sho'

[Outro: Jermaine Dupri + Ludacris]
Welcome to Atlanta remix, hey
And we ride on them things like every day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin'
And parties don't stop 'til eight in the morning
Welcome to Atlanta where the players play
And we ride on them things like every day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin'
And parties don't stop 'til eight in the morning

Somewhere outside the states, where tommorow's like today
And I'm out in a space where nobody else can stay
And, if I can go, with you
Then I'll go get the ticket right now if that's cool
Have you ever been close to feelin like leavin the coast too
Feelin like leavin with somebody who
Hold you the right way while watchin the night fade
Make you feel like you right back in the ninth grade
When you know what he likes and what he might say
And you try to be calm and answer in nice ways
And, if I can go, with you
Way out the states no 2-ways and no page
No cells and no trace, and you just a phone call away
So all I got to say is

If I can go, contigo, I'll pack my things, soon as you say
Baby vamos, we'll fly away, like there is no, no tomorrow

In Croix, you better know I know how to sneak with them toys
Employed, with the block since around 94 boy
And, if I can flow, with you
Holdin dat dough after the studio I roll with you
I send Dutch and three other goons to go get you
Sacario the name awaits the whole issue
Grown men keep on cryin get mo' tissue
The way me and this girl be rhymin it's so official
Them I'm takin a trip too with no pistols
Cause everything peace only sand no streets
Little Miami Heat, that's the plan we'll see
Two cups, one in Senado one in Sand Beach
And, I'll think I'll go, with you
So tell the station you need a week - back to you

Soon as you say the word, we'll be on our way
To a foreign place, you got to tell me

Yo, uh, so now that we got a plan are you comin? We could plan a week
The only question now is LaGuardia or Kennedy?

Ok, that little place it's a great move
But ain't no problems, unless the water don't stay blue

[Sacario] And the shop's there?

[Angie Martinez]
If they don't got em, they don't make em (Sacario: True!)
No concrete just sand, throw away your shoes
Now, that we are on, our way
And our bags is packed and the car service is not late
Everything's ok, so I guess I catch you on the next track
Now I don't gotta ask

Look now beyond the rims and all the 'dro
The 'dro and all the smoke, my throat, it makes me choke
Like a serial killer was squeezin on my throat box
In the clutches of danger but not a stranger on the block
Is it the cheeferry reefer be blowin my chest up
Be riding from the club trying my best not to mess up
A professor of this lyrical thang, I'll take the purist strain
Of this slang and inject it into your veins
Did your heart stop man? Drop-top fade
Aviator shades with a mirror front face
Movin through the dirty at a slow pimps pace
Kinda like the turtle and the rabbit in the race
To the finish line, I jumped a pair of Reeboks
So bright, so fresh, snow white but no socks
Then I slip on some of that O with the wings
I bust it straight out the pack like a three piece
Prophylactic, before you splack it
You gotta prepare it and mack it, wear your jacket or it's tragic
Not intended for any illegal purposes
It's like anthrax and small pox in surplus to murderous

It's so good girl, real love
True love, it's alright baby tainted love, real love, true love
Tainted love

Think of her think of me
Think about us, it's a intimacy
I'm trying to strum like guitars in this beat
And consider riding she'll kick the blahzay spleen
Plus you got a man, but he ain't quite me
The type of man that try to give you what you need
And he wanna know where you are, where you be
Where you going, where you today, where you started to be, damn
If I was him I wouldn't even leave
I would trust you what you say that you are where you been
Say he the type of nigga that's still cheap
Take his girl on a date and they go to Mickey D's
See, I'm the type that try to stab in a jeep
Try to take you out to see things and occasionally creep
Yeah, your man is doing things I can't really see
Don't sound too good, it sound tainted to me

How many years does it take for a record to blow?
I'm doing exactly how many licks it took for my hoes
Spending your cash flow cause she was so out ho
Scandal love, cause love full of scandal
Too much chick for that ass she couldn't handle that
Well it's the same tainted love in the music business
People they lose their brain just to get up in this
Let's be a star for a day, everything in life is just okay
People say things they don't really wanna say
Hey but it's okay, cause you're a star for the day
People a smile at you when they really wanna frown
Well a that's just the way tainted folk get down
Just keep it real and, we'll see
When the situation is tainted love is always free

Love is always free

True love, tainted love, real love, true love, real

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
You say you love me, but is it really real?
Would you, fix me green tea if I'm feeling ill
Could you, give me a back rub to sooth after a long day?
Dinner by candlelight but you're the main entree
And if so, I do the same with other treats to give you
Trailing rose pedals from your door to beneath your pillow
With a bucket of champagne on your night stand
Experience with someone who want in they lifespan
The same...

[Outro: Dwele]
Real love, real, real, everybody knows that love's real love
Someone to trust in you for real
Everybody need love; that's real
I would never want nothing tainted
Wait a minute, what you feel?
Faded if your loving was tainted
True, oh, I know true love is hard to find
Just let it find you; for real
If you found love to keep it real
Keep love from being tainted, being tainted
Oooh then you'll, be, alright

I assume I'm so into you
Cause even before we hit the bedroom I was friends wit you
If they ask, I ain't got to say ""whom?"" in them interviews
My sweet thing never believe the rumors, that been ain't true
The fact I had numerous friends is true
But you was wifey, could change me to a groom in a minute boo
Maybe, my sense of humor gets into you
But girl, they could make a perfume from the scent of you
I wanna take you where it feel like June in December too
So what you think about Cancun 'til the winter through?
I don't know what the other consumers you been with do
I put a day aside, to go to Bloomy's and spend with you
Like any other man, I wanna zoom to the clinic too
But I wanna see if me and my junior's identical
A dude put a wound on the skin of you
I swear to everything, that same afternoon, I'll be in the news
Feel me?

All I'm askin, is let me cash in
Cause I'd give all the passion, all of the Sean John fashion
In orderly fashion, perhaps when
You figure out, exactly what Diddy 'bout
Cause we could take this whole city out
Now who gon' stop us, who gon' knock us?

Couple winter lodges, few summer homes
I'm there for every ""ooh"", ""um"", and moan
And make sure when the new Hummer roams, the shoes come in chrome
I ain't new at buying white, yellow, and cucumber stones
That send chills through a woman bones, but life gets gruesome alone
Even though I got the kinda bread that won't matter if a few crumbs are blown
Flights, I done flew some alone
Now I wanna wake up everyday with you in a new number zone
Mama mia, it's you I'mma phone
Just to erase all the negative views from your dome
And I promise this fellas G, it's so gangsta it'll calm all that jealousy
And drama you tellin me, so mama come yell at me

I'm like Darius cause I can shoot two miles

Shake the checks off your Nikes

And it look like a free throw when I be shooting from half
The first step like Iverson - blow past you
Usually nothing but net, but I can go glass too
When I'm in the paint the defense so shook
They dont know if I'mma put up a slow hook, or dish off a no-look

Plus I'll tell you what the 80's like

Need a man that's polite, listens and takes advice

Man that shit ain't cool man
(Okay order in the court)

Woman: The people versus Bone Thugs N Harmony
Case number C601999
Judge: Will The defendant please stand
Is there anything you wish to say on this matter
Before sentencing Bizzy Bone?
Bizzy: No man
[You know the muthafucka did it]

Judge: Well the court sentences you to death by electric chair

(Some guy laughs)

Verse 1: Bizzy Bone

We had to get 'em up wid two thugs
Runnin' side by side wid number one
Murda mo drop my guage on 'em
When the po-po chase
If they catch me barehanded I'm done
Rip's gripping the six shot pump, so spill it
Copper lettin' the lead off
Copper thought that he had me caught
Little Layzie blew his head off (AAwwwwwww)
Get him up, and get up
The bullets they start to get lit up
Number one best start duckin' wid ah gun already buckin'
Bust me lead on the double Glock 'n
Where the fiends roll up for rocks 'n
This perfect getaway
]From the pigs when I peel and I hit the fences
Rippin' up the trench and
I'm bailing while they trailing
Better in hell than in the cell
And it ain't no telling where the coppers be dwelling
One had spotted me, picked up a piece and shot at me
But I practice what I preach
And see that these slugs up in his body got him
Run, wid smoke coming from the barrel ah me gun
Hit the bend, oh what the dum dum I got yum yummed on the dead end
They set in, then they lead in
They wanting me off in the coffin
Cops from everywhere was yellin' and wailin' I went unconscious
From the stompin' taking ah loss, and waking up in the coffin
And without no stallin'
Cell I was tossed in to be arraigned at dawn and
Looking in the eyes of a judge
He knew right where to put that thug
Made to be so, wid no parole
In the hole but I won't budge
Sent me to deathrow
Watchin' the time by fly past
But Rip'll be sittin' mindless never spineless, in silence
Hoping I die fast, but chill
Never do, sleepa, gotta get put that on all me reefer
Somehow must beat ya, so peep out the creep or the reaper will meet ya

Verse 2: Layzie Bone

Bailin' on ah mission, flippin' the script
Betta check what the wind just blew in
Betta think again, it's a preacher wid ah grin
On ah mission for revenge, wid that Mack-10
Little nigga Rip, had to empty the clip
Gotta pump them slugs up in them cops
Steady made 'em drop Glock went pop pop
Goin' out like a thug on the double Glock
Back from hell and ready to bail
Time to hit they trail cause they wanted my nigga fried
Holdin' the Bible when I got a grenade I'mma go inside the squad
Gettin' ready for the rumble
When I heard them mumbles, pullin' me guage in laughter
Keep buckin 'em faster all I was thinkin'
When I see them bustas scatter
Betta watch out for them buckshots
Cause them can't fade me gauge
Gotta bust them souls in the grave
So I'm buckin' them straight to the pave, can't be saved
I'm bucking, little Ripster reinforcements comin' in faster
Blast give my nigga Double Zs the MAC-10
Lettin' the gun gun blaze on they ass
Gotta rip in them chests through vests
Mac-10s, sawed off eruptions, got plenty ammunition
No missing listen destruction I'm bustin'
Cause I'm making that getaway, bound to getaway
Niggas got to escape and it's never to late
When you dash and tryna' break
Nigga just can't test the Bone fate
We steadily runnin' duckin'
Comin' up to the front door barri-caded
And I pulled a grenade, tossed to the door, let it explode
And we made it, creepin' in the courtyard
So Krayzie feelin' safety coming
Hittin' the fence and jump in it quick
]From Krayzie's tech-9 bullets humming

Bridge: [Two guys talking]

Well it seems as if them two boys Bizzy and Layzie
Done got theyselves into another jam
[Well I'd love to see them boys get theyself outta this one]

Verse 3: Krayzie Bone

Soon as I went in the smoke, rollin' real fast like a dog
And began wid a rage and the guage can't let go
They done labelled my nigga psychotic
Bitches is got him sittin' on deathrow
Scoping out the tower peeping the scene
So when my niggas trail
Screaming out one eighty seven and bail
Gotta get my nigga Rip out that cell, it's all over now
How my nigga number one disguised as the preacher
Won't be pullin' ah Bible mission for survival nigga so I creep the
Tech millimetre, somebody done pull the alarm now it's on
Slaughterin' Bone, sprayed off the tech
Gotta let 'em know which way was on
We got gone but them police was pullin' up quick nigga what's up
Quick bust in first when he hit that fence niggas got cut the fuck up
We steady bucking, steady duckin' buckin' while I was jumpin'
All we was thinking is don't get caught
Nigga like me get the gun running
Gunning fronting wid thugs gotta get to the smug
Turn around and we pump slugs, put 'em in the mud
And all across my face was the red that lay in blood
Dodging the who, make the gun flip wid ah swoo
Bailing back on wid my troops
I'm runnin' wid 4 crazy niggas
That's down wid they niggas they ain't scared to shoot
Now I'm rolling, no more than ah half ah mile we get stopped
Cops surround Bone, we load Glocks
And squeeze say fuck all these road blocks
Busted ah U, then put that bitch in reverse
And I get the swish and I push the button
That boy came out the trunk and
Put it in drive see that Souljah boy bucking
Back in the other direction
Po-po came quick then heat up
Niggas blast at each other
Open up they doors and they get they feet up
I jumped outta the car, had to jump over the hood
Cause I'm headin' straight for the woods
So the niggas they follow behind me
We getaway smooth, ah nigga made good
Came up quick to the hideout
Wait until midnight till we ride out
Hit ah car so we can drive out
While we waited we all got fried out, fool
If youse a thuggish ruggish thug nigga scream mo
Took one ah my niggas off deathrow now we got one mo to go

Tim took you from ghetto to class, how to hold your glass
To Fendi's to bags, for holdin' your cash
People was seein' you pass, like right through the drapes
I bought you the private, house wit the gates
Thinkin' that stuff make me faint, just whistle real fast
Cougars roll in the grass, same cat on your Jag
Why your keepin' them tabs, and callin' me for
It cost every minute, and you know I'm on tour
And I'm deeply committed, although I'm forgettin'
Sometimes while hittin' it, different names would slip
If I been wit a chick, check me miss
Your complexion switched, honey you been on trips
But you don't appreciate this, till your back in the Jetta
No iceberg you own, just Angelica's sweaters
If the steaks ain't T-Bone, you ain't properly fed
Hun tonight is bet burgers, no cheese on the bread
And I say

600 drops, Hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end; just me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end; just me and my boyfriend

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Hook]
(I said) give me two pairs
(Cause) I need two pairs
(So I) can get to stompin' in my Air Force Ones
Big boys stompin' in my Air Force Ones

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I like the all-white, high-top strap with the gum bottom
There's somethin' bout 'em, now dirty that's why I got 'em
I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em
The last person that touched 'em I been shot 'em

[Verse 2: Kyjuan]
Now if you look, and see lime-green Forces; it's Kiwi
You couldn't get this color if you had a personal genie
You know I keeps it hip-hop; my niggas flip-flop
Yeah, my Force Ones in tip-top (me) now form a flip flops

[Verse 3: Ali]
Me? I like the limited edition, and khaki, and army green
Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings
Size twelve with the strap, red and white with a Cardinal cap
All flavors but it just depend on when and where I'm at

[Verse 4: Murphy Lee]
Don't get me wrong, man
And Murphy Lee ain't dumb, man
Cause if the shoe is on the shelf
You should have some, man
You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man
You may not have three or four
But you got one, man (big boy)

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Murphy Lee]
We up in Foot Locker; I'm lookin' like I need those
Ten in a half and if you got 'em give me two of those
I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo'
Cause she's just standin there as if I'm shootin free throws
I said, ""Excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes""
She said, ""I love you Murph especially in the white 'n blue""
I said, The white 'n blue sound nice make it twice""
And I signed an (yo) autograph (yo), ""Thanks for the advice""

[Verse 6: Ali]
I keep it real dirty, dirty you know how I do
Purple in gold with the Lakers the Broncos the orange and blue
I like 'em floppy with ankle socks
Lows mids and high tops,  which are clear so
But this tims and fat laces with it is cold
But when the winter go (burrr) and the hot summer flow
Then it's back to the all purpose wit them lil' dots in the toe
Then I'm stopping this dough that I'm spending fa sho
On dem Nike Air Force, ""NE"" behind the ""O""

[Verse 7: Kyjuan]
O-kay Lee, I treat my shoe like my ride
Chrome on the fat laces at what wood on the inside
Spray candy on the swoosh, with the electric roof
Since I put a kit on the sole, I got a wider shoe
You see that low-mid Skittle purple coupe I'm drivin in
(Kyjuan, were you getting dem colors, are you dyin them)
Ten is my size in dem, no point in tyin dem
Ain't no point in tryin these on, you know I'm buyin dem

[Verse 8: Nelly]
Now don't nothing get the hype on first site like, white on whites
Them three quarters, them lows, they all tight
The only problem they only good for one night
Cause once you scuff 'em you fucked up your whole night
What's my basis? The look on store owner's faces
This kid's outrageous, he's buyin them by the cases
Cause once I cop 'em gut 'em and switch the laces
They all purpose ya heard me kinda like my daytons

[Hook]

[Verse 9: Kyjuan]
I wore spurs at first now theres tape on dem
Damn, when those came out? So I write the date on them
These Louis Vuitton ones, you gotta wait on dem
I had to get em early so I spent more cake on dem

[Verse 10: Murphy Lee]
Look I'm tryin to keep it up like a one minute man
While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands
Jewelry and all (wow) fish bowlin 'em all
(I got some fifteens) security buyin shoes and all

[Verse 11: Nelly]
Now some time I get em free some time I gotta pay
Walk in the mall and they now what I'm bout to say
Gimme the black and platinum, and leather gray
Ones in the back and (yo) the pair you got on display (check)

[Verse 12: Ali]
Now where da boxes where I keep mine (keep mine)
You should peep mine , (beep mine)
Maybe once or twice but never three times
I'm just a sneaker pro, I love pumas and shell toes
But can't nothin compare to a fresh crispy white pearl

Dealing with him

[Ja Rule]
I know you're living your life faithfully, safely, away from me
But you miss being next to me, don't you?
Don't let her love haunt you, lust for what you wanted
Go for your guns and back out on anyone who tries to interfere
Or intervene on me
Peeling your wide body out of them tight jeans
Wrist on freeze, see it's on me
Shoes 19, coming through in that new Bentley thing
From town to town and city to city
You and I make headlines like Lo and Diddy and Bob and Whitney
I'm here cause the Lord sent me to pound puss like a pugilist
But real devilish and freak bad bitches
Forget the story, I know you're getting bored
And that boy ain't getting you horny no more, is he??
Cause when it's all said and done, it's me
Loving, thugging and I know you...

[Hook]

[Ja Rule]
Sweet thing living it
Won't you let me let you live it a little bit
I know a stressful relationship is hard to deal with
But here's how to deal with it
On your weekly visits
Use a code name to protect the innocent
Maybe I'm true generous
Generally believing that all women want me
They don't wanna get even
But who do you believe in
Is it money or God
Betrayal or trust, sustain your vows
Secretly or sacred
Cause I love it when you rock your body-body
Move your body-body
Drink up on the Bacardi
And roll up along side me
I love to see you wild and free
But occasionally you get cold wet feet
And all that it means to me is that you need my heat(Ja!)
Cause when it's said and done you're gonna want me
Loving, thugging and I know you...

[Hook]

[Ja Rule]
Baby, here I'm holding your love hostage
The ransom for you, sugar, be priceless
Cause you been getting at me in many a ways
Now tell your man to watch his back and duck them strays
Cause I been in a rage lately
Hoping God will forgive me for all the sin and all the woman
All the drama I been in and it's just the beginning
I hope your watching so you could see that nigga ain't built
Like me!! Black Sheep of the family
But we one in the same, that's why we get along
Freak off and get it on
When we make love looking something like soft porn
Tell me, baby, do you really wanna go home to him??
But the brightest of your days just going look dim
Cause you fucking with a loser, baby, you can't win
When it's said and done you're gonna need me
Loving, thugging and I know you....

Though this love may hurt a bit

Thug holiday, go ahead you can cry this up right baby
Everything gone be gravy later, that's right
This the time when we take time to remember
All the loved ones we lost in the struggle you know
I dedicate this to my brother Hollywood, Toby, Bam
My dog Itchy and Lil Trav, I dedicate this to the struggle
Everybody in the county jail, state penn, check it out

[Trick Daddy]
Here go one for bad luck, hell against that a nigga wouldn't have none
But when I think about it, what would I be without my gun
How could I, get away from the po-po's, if a, nigga couldn't run
And how was I given a daughter when I always prayed for a son
Life is crazy ain't it, sometimes I even think the same thing
I've been waiting on freeing the ring hell but ain't a thang changed
And I lost my brother in the struggle, Taterhead done lost his mother
And I'm thinking about it who's mine's who gone raise my brother
Not to be a thug, stay in school, don't use drugs
Who'll teach him right from wrong and show them boys, true love
So I pray for the better days, face the bomb had a run-a-ways
And, I put my guns away and I pray for peace on Sundays, it's crazy ain't it

Just like the fellas, in prison, we miss you so much for real
What about the children, who ran away, that ain't coming home today

Cause when them thugs really need it the most a thug holiday

Just like 'em, just like 'em, just like 'em, a thug holiday - 2x

Here go one for, all these killings and all these conflicts in religion
See the Muslims, Jews and Christians but know they are all God's children
There's only, one him, plus ain't none of y'all confronting him
So blind in our own minds we wouldn't even know God if we was in front of him
And, I read your books know all your remixes to the bible
What about a, verse for the thugs curled with drugs and survival
That's asking chapels naming Martin, Malcolm and Farrakhan
In all my history books, only one died was the Americans
And, that's point of my, who's responsible for Vietnam
And, hold on there's more, we had two World Wars
And, how come the judges make more than the teachers is making
When they the ones raising all the taxes and got us fighting for education
Life is crazy ain't it

[Hook]
So many tears, through out the years
Somebody tell me what's going on
And so many liiives, but only God knows
About the pain deep inside
It gets so hard, you got to keep your head up
I know you're fed up, but stay strong
Here's a message from coast to coast
Cause when them thugs really need it the most, thug holiday

But them boys want the money man)
Hooooouuuuuu
Hooooouuuuuu
Hooooouuuuuu
What you say, what you say
Hot damn!

[Verse 1 - Malice]
My, how the boy's grown
From roaming low-income homes
To homes of his own
No catching up, he's in a whole another zone
Still true to his roots, stay close to the chrome
Haters stay clear of 'em, y'all stand cheer for him
Got up out the game and overcame, let's hear it for him
Keep a new toy, so I wonder how could
I not enjoy life, I'm reliving my childhood
Big chain monster, whip game bonkers
Monster truck, remind him of Tonka
Diamond F color, plush gold still gutter
My deal is in the mils, motherfucker
And I ain't stutter
Bittersweet, my life's a musical
From holding nose to rose gold, the Lord's beautiful
Before him I'm too shamed to show my face
But shit's so mean
Can't help but to fall from grace, motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Ab Liva]
Hot damn, when the white hit the pan it
Twists and it tumbles it, flips and it fumbles
I mix it like gumbo, I pitch it so subtle
I keep hustlers puzzled
Feds, I got 'em wondering
Wondering, what happened to that boy
Six maneuver, how'd I slip into that toy
Is it the pimp, the crook, the hustlin' thing
The man, the music they're making a king
I'm simply building my mink
A million men marching like Martin Luther King
The King Kong of verse, making the world sing
My heart's on the sleeve for dark faces just like mine
Peeking through bars, hoping the sun shines on 'em
But you still got to watch the phonies
Watch your homies, we got you homie

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Pusha T]
Yuugh
Handled the rock like none other
Wrist over the stove, head under the cupboard
In the kitchen 'til the fume make me feel smothered
The way it melt, fiends can't believe it's not butter
The way it melt, he won't cop from none other
Then he who holds Os like Krispy Kreme's oven
Or Easy Bake, pink divies make
The Presidential look like strawberry shortcake, P

Imagine that Rolls Royce crashed and me unscratched
In that Billionaire Boy's Club fashion
Uh, you niggas is clones
I hand out styles like ice cream cones\
The fuck outta here

[Verse 4 - Rosco P. Coldchain]
Neither the sun or death can be looked at
That's what an OG told me
That was the exact moment I decided to take a pact
And if you owe me and if I decided to take it back
It wasn't nicely, expect Rosco to put you back, in place
On you call a destructive warpath
It'll be shell showers in today's forecast
You a gangsta, I can't tell
Your diamonds don't glimmer when the light hit it
Those jewels aren't genuine, because if they was
I'm nice with it, I woulda' been took that
That skinny stack in your pocket, I woulda been shook that
In this world you gotta watch it, I'm hear to warn you
Cats turned informant, over snow wrapped in wax
My son's home cryin', don't give me no slack
Just put the motherfucking money in the bag
These words are being said as I hide behind glove and mask
Coldchain's not your typical crook
I'm being watched look at the camera lens in the bush

All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you
All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jacking off cause you ain't there

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
'65 Chevrolet Impala peachy cream
Cruising down the street like two fingers
Cause the ivory is clean
Talking bout meeting at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Cause she mobile than a grip
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Tell em a good game, juju pimping
Give em to my nigga Dime Legit
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hip dips, hair net, mo' stretch
It's a camel toe and thats fo' sho
My brain is on one track
Like Mary Mary toss for crackle like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genatalia's where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a WO-man for that act
Personal preference cause I use the law of nature as a reference
No I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me
From them female fantasies frolic freely
In my cock pit, every 30 some seconds I can't stop it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Killer Kill from Adamsville and in a Bonneville I chill
Heffers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' cute lil' coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra

Grandaddy, grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up, what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I don't need that A.I.D.S
A D. and an A. missin' out my Adidas
PLUS, We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but there's no jumping brooms

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom, boom

[Verse 1: Spliff Star]
We been together for a few years, shared a few tears
Called each other nicknames like Sugar Plum and Poo Bear
I'm always on the road, hardly ever home
Always busy this busy that can't talk on the phone

Listen ma I'm just motivated, I do this for us
Step on the grind tryin' to elevate it now

[Verse 4: Rah Digga]
We started out broke
Constantly on a roll
Cuttin' up in the streets like we would never get old
Went from looseys and buses to fifty cent sodas
And Novas to Hondas to Lexus to Rovers
Mad years passed
Still got each other back (oh yeah)
Word is bond never screw none of these industry cats (boy)
We like Scull and Mulder
Walkin' shoulder to shoulder
Milkin' this game watchin' our seeds gettin' older

But you don't put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litagations
And I respect you gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank you
She's my pinch hitter
When the startin lineup ain't playin right
I come off the bench with her
It might sound like I'm gassin you
But it take time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creepin and sneakin
Just to keep it from leakin
We so deep in our freakin
That we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey's a little bit uptight
Wonderin why I keep coming home in the middle of the night

I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So I cop her one and cop you one too
You always get a daily page weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry about you tellin the whole world I'm your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin I denied
Something I would slide
Just to do somethin in the ride
But shorty, there's something you provide
Cause the entree ain't as good without somethin' on the side you know?

I just want to chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ‘cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we can have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me, or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile

[Intro: 2Pac]
Straight motherfuckin' ballin', part 2
Still ballin', Westside!

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now, ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary
Still ballin', ridin' on these niggas ‘cause they lame
In a '61 Chevy, still heavy in this game
Can you feel me? Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga
Up before the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up, Westside!
Ain't nobody loved me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger, Lord forgive me if I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, then fuck her from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California is where I'm at ridin'
Passed by while these niggas wondered why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry? Hell nah, nigga, tears shed, for all my homies in the pen, many peers dead; a nigga still ballin'

[Hook: 2Pac & (Trick Daddy)]
Still ballin' until I die (until I die)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin' (I be ballin')
Niggas wonder why (they wonder why)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin'

[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
Now, as I kneel and pray I hope the Lord understand
When he's gone, devolve, I become a dangerous man
Ain't crazy or deranged, I'm sayin'
But when these kids go to spray 'em, boy, won't be playin'
With clientele, any rhyme sales
Question is: Will you fuck-niggas ride for real, huh?
Bitch nigga, this is G-rated
Plus your homeboy won't make it, street game Fugazi
I'm elevated to the top of this shit
Done fucked around and put me and 2Pac on the bitch
And you can tell 'em ""Thug Life"" was the reason for this
And I ride for any nigga who believe in the shit; still ballin'

[Hook: 2Pac]
Until the day I die
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin'
Niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin'

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now everybody wanna see us dead
Two murdered on the front page
Shot to death, bullets to the head
Niggas holla out my name and it's similar to rape
Motherfuckers know I'm comin', so they runnin' to they graves
Watch! Swoop down with my nigga from the Pound
‘Cause Trick don't give a fuck
Where you coward niggas now?
Blast, keep pumpin', ain't worried about nothin'
Busters thought we was frontin'
So reload and keep dumpin'; still ballin'

[Hook: 2Pac & (Trick Daddy)]
(I'm still ballin') 'til the day I die ('til I die)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin' (I be ballin')
Niggas wonder why (they wonder why)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin'
'Til the day I die (still ballin')
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin'
Niggas wonder why (tell 'em!)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true
Motherfucker, still ballin', until the day I die
(Thug life), still ballin'
Motherfucker, still ballin'

Yea, you could trust me, haha

La la la la la

[Hook: Tony Sunshine]
I don't care about nothing else my baby (Baby I don't care)
All I care is bout being here for you (Oooh)
And I won't stare at nobody else my baby (Promise I won't stare)
Cuz all I need is you (All I need, all I need baby)

[Talking: Fat Joe]
To all the ladies in our lives, you heard
Strong independent women, come on
Yea, huh

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
What you think gangstas don't cry get hurt by lies
Times you embarrassed me I swallowed my pride
I'm tired of telling you I got nothing to hide
I'm in the studio at night you think I'm out with the guys
Every time I speak to you you got something to say
According to you I'mma speed crushing all day
All I'm askin you for is to be more trusting
I'm outta town all the time and don't accuse you of nothing
Picture me creepin with a chick on tour
When you love my son as if it was yours
I know at times you feel alone cuz I'm not at home
That's why every few hours I pick up the phone
To reassure you my love is more then a scene
I adore you my wife my Colombian queen
I promise to never stray I'm on it everyday
To have a woman like you in the life of Jose (Hey)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Armageddon]
Yea how I'm supposed to start this
First and first you my queen goddess
My moon my earth the wisdom to a nigga's knowledge
I swear to god it amazes me how you stay in college
And still manage to raise my baby boy when I'm gone and
Touring making dollars assuming that I love you or regardless
I feel its time I showed you bless you with this ring, now that's
Something to hold you down till a nigga come back
Me and my lady got history this worth she deserves
More then this cold world is giving me to share with her word
And I don't care about nothing else except my girl (my girl)
Not myself no one else just my girl (my girl)
You bring life to my world you give me strength to go on
And face life even when it seems all holes gone
Labeled my wife but you truly exceed the title
You my future my happiness my heart my idol
I promise girl, that

[Hook]

[Talking: Fat Joe]
Haha
This is going out to you, you and you and you

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
To all the ladies out there if you love your man
You need to hold your man embrace your man
And just grab his hand repeat after me
I promise to stay true and give you all of me
Whether he's locked down or on the grind
Or whether is out of work or at work on time
You need to trust that man and respect that man
And you get what you feel you deserve from that man, and

[Tony Sunshine]
Cuz I need somebody who will stand by me
Through the good times and bad times who will always...
Always be my girl

I tried to told ya
That most girls really freaks
And this is how they got to
Make their money every week

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - David Banner]
Step into club looking just like a pimp
We got cash, so we screaming out ""shake something bitch!""
This is the song, tell the DJ put it on
Micheal Tyler made you shake
Sisqo made you show your thong
Bitch I'm dead wrong!
The playa from the crib
So get out on the floor
And girl, get it how you live
And since you so hot
Fuck it, show your pussy lips
You go to Tougaloo, but I know you still flip
Bitch, don't trip! Ain't a damn thing changed
I still love my queen
But bitches keep me to the game
So if you gotta ho, shake em up and let em go
And let them girls get down on the floor
Like a pimp!

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Lil Flip]
Now don't you hate them old
Lying ass hoes?
Smiling in your face
Wearing her best friend's clothes
I suppose they like the way me and Banner pimp
You can catch us at Pappadeaux
Eating steak and shrimp

[David Banner]
Or you can catch us at E&J's pouring it up
Flip whipping Cali trucks
Girls licking my nuts
We some Southside pimps
And we ain't giving a fuck
Poke your girl up in the throat
And make her swallow the nut

[Lil' Flip]
We make em swallow the nut, so
Follow the truck: Lil Flip and David Banner
We got all of the bucks, and
All of they sluts and all of the hoes
So drop it like it's hot, girl
Touch your fucking toes

[David Banner]
Go on, touch your toes, and
Make me a roll and go on - hit the mall
And buy me some clothes, mane
And if your boy trip, I'mma bust a clip
Y'all bitches can't fuck with me and Lil Flip!

It's your turn now kid
Show em what you got

[Verse: Loon]
I be that young handsome cat
Same color chocolate
Same nigga pop shit, same nigga got shit
Loon ain't no lame, Loon never gossip
Nigga Loon in the game cause Loon got some hot shit
Sick of you cats screaming out block shit
I done sold numerous drugs and drew the block sick
Look at me now, pull up in the drop six
Bitch in your block looked at my watch and she got sick
Look at her now, all up in the cock pit
Rolling my windows up to get a kid top quick
Loon is a pimp, trick ain't the topic?
Nigga you do the shrimp, trip to the tropics
That's not my steez, not like me
It's not the way I wanna blow my cheese, like I blow my trees
The whole world know I need, a girl that'll curl my toes for me

[Hook: Kelis] (2x)
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
Daddy how you want to give it to me
A Bad Boy is what I need

[Verse: Loon]
Less confusion, party with Puff last conclusion
Grab shorty there wit the hair, ass is huge and
Lips is juicy, way she move her hips so loosely
Critical curves see it through furs
Curious so I want to see if it's hers
Delirious so I had to see if it's her (it wasn't me)
I ain't touch you that's on me and my words
You ain't gotta flip the script, kick me to the curb
Cause I was, just checking you wasn't disrespecting you
Lips so sexual while your friend's protecting you
Baby girl I know you're far from a slut
I know the difference between a car and a truck
I'm not a dumb nigga
You had these young niggas scarring you up
You know the difference between a scar and a cut
You're not a dumb nigga
So let's take it from the car to the club
And hit the bar and get a bottle of bub, and have fun nigga

[Hook]

[Verse: Loon]
Baby all bubble, have a lil chat a small huddle
Time to make money and more trouble
And we all hungry and all hustle
And we all humble, but together we got more muscle
And we got dough, nigga me and P we hot yo
Make a hip hop show look like a rock show
Ooh Jesus Christ! look the way that the rocks glow
Want the world to see so we keeping them tops low
Rascal, keep it on my lap for Broscoe
One shot your blood drip thicker than Basco
Drop though, keep the illest cat wit the hot flow
Watch your pro turn grown men to a snot nose
I pity a fool, never touch titties in schools
Son you can't hang wit Diddy and Loon
We allstars, nigga playing bet he was cool
Got more broads than you and any nigga in your crew, Bad Boy

I think you're truly something special (Ooooh)
Just what my dream are really made of (Dreams are really made of)
Let's stay together you and me boy (Ooo-ooo-ooh)
There's no one like you 'round, oh baby
Oh, I wanna love you, yeah yeah

Uh, uh huh, uh, uh huh, uh (Ooo-ooh)
Yeah, yeah, oh, uh

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
I can't really explain it
I'm so into you now, I want to be more than a friend of you now
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now
And I don't bring the problems from the 90's into 2 thou'
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vow's
Maybe, I'm speaking general now
But girl I'mma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikini's in the winter too now
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On 5th Ave. shopping spree's, and them dinners to Chow's
I ain't concerned what other men would do now
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now
And I ain't jealous it's the principle now, I'm so into you

[Hook x2 - Tamia]
I, really like
What you've, done to me
I can't really explain it
I'm, so into you

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
Come on ma, it's more than a flashin'
I woulda traded it all, in orderly fashion
My villa in Florida we crashin'
Just off the shore, so you can hear when water be splashin'
The drop top three and a quarter we dashin'
The flawless diamonds, and the border we flashin'
The money, we oughta be stashin'
I make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it
My friend be thinkin' I'm slippin', these girls be thinkin' I'm trippin'
What kinda weed he be smokin', what type of drinks he be sippin'
Sweet thing, just to think of you dippin'
Would have me with the blue's so hard, you would think I was crippin'
Now, you relaxin' in the Benz, credit cards with no limits
So you don't worry about maxin' when you spend
Ever since you've been askin' 'bout the friends
How'd you like it if, both our name's had Jackson on the ends, uh

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
I don't wanna trip, but truth is
Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus'
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becoming too stressful
But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St. Bart, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted
But I can't really explain it, uh, yeah

[Hook] x2

[Outro - Tamia]
I, really like (Ooo-ooo-ooh)
What I feel, when I'm with you (With you)
You're a dream come true (You're, oh yeah, yeah)
Don't you ever leave my side (Ever leave my side, oh no)

She fly like the planes in the air
That's right, she full grown, settin' the wrong tone
I'm diggin' the energy and I'm lovin' her ozone
So fly, like a dove, fly, like a raven
Quick, to politic with some fly, conversation
In a natural mood, then I'm a natural dude
And we some natural fools, blowin' out by the pool
She like my sexy cool mama, we'll blaze on the Barada
Rockin' Dolce & Gabbana, with hydro in a Cubana

[Hook]
Got me lifted, shifted higher than the ceilin'
And ooohwee, it's the ultimate feelin'
You got me lifted, feeling so gifted
Sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly
Sugar, sugar, how you get so fly

[Bridge]
You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watchin' screens gettin' high
Girl, you keep it so fly, with your sweet honey buns
You was there when the money was gone
You'll be there when the money comes
You know it's leather when we ride
Wood grain and raw hide
Doing what we do, watchin' screens gettin' high
Girl, you keep it so fly, with your sweet honey buns
You was there when the money was gone
You'll be there when the money comes

[Verse 1: Chingy]
Peeps call me up [phone ring] said it's a ho-tel party
Just bring the liquor, there's already eight shawties
I'm on my way, let me stop by the store
Get a 12-pack of Corona - plus an ounce of 'dro, ya know?
Now I'm on Highway 270 to Natural Bridge Rd
I'm already blowed, hit third I'mma be be blowed some mo'
Pulled up, stop parked, rims still spinning
Valet looking like he in the game and must be winning
To room 490 I'm headed, on my way up
It's three girls on the elevator like: ""wassup?""
I told em: ""follow me"". they knew I had it cracking B
One said ""ain't you that boy that be on BET?""
""Ya that's me, Ching-a-ling equipped with much ding-a-ling""
Knock on the door, I'm on the scene of things
Busted in, Henny bottle to the face
Fuck it then, feel like my head is toxic waste
It's some pretty girls in hurr, I heard em whispering
Talking bout ""that's that dude that sing ""Right Thurr"" - he glistening""
I ain't come to talk, I ain't come to sit
What I came for was to find out who I'm gonna hit, aww shit

Ma showed up like ""what's the hold up?""
Man know what, get them wraps and roll up
I took a chick in the bathroom seeing what's poppin
You know what's on my mind, shirts off and panties dropping
Niggas knocking on the door drunk, acting silly
The girl said ""can I be in yo video"" I'm like ""yeah!"", ""oh really?""
Now she naked strip teasing, me I'm just cheesing
She gave me a reason to be a damn heathen
Handled that, told ol' G, bring tha camera
Then I thought about, no footage as I ram her
Walked out the bathroom smiling, cats still wilding
Sharing the next room with some girls looking like they from an island

Stop, drop, KABOOM!, baby rub on your nipples
Some call me Ludacris, some call me Mr. Wiggles
Far from little, make ya mammary glands jiggle
Got 'em under control, with a bowl of Tender Vittles
Doc-tor giggles, I can't stop until it tickles
Just play a little ""D"" and I'll make ya mouth dribble
Bits and Kibbles, got 'em all after the pickle
I swing it like a bat, but these balls are not Wiffle
Hit 'em in triples, with no strikes, stripes, or whistles
I ain't felt this good, since my wood lived off a thistle
Sippin' some ripple, I got quarters, dimes, and nickels
For shizzle dizzle, I'm on a track with the Big Snoop Dizzle
Let the Henny trickle, down the beat, with a ghetto tempo
I done blazed the instrumental, laid it plain and simple
Getting brain in the rental, I done did it again
My eyes chinky, I'm with Chingy, at the Holiday Inn

Sing about how she got her heart broke
She was reaching for stars
I just want me something natural
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know

But won't you talk to a player
Let me help out your pride?

A shrink or a freak
Peep (my) my technique
I wear minks, gator boots
And I'm the the one that gets the loot
And I ain't afraid to shoot
And I love to toot toot
Beep beep as I slide up the street
I'm from the LBC
And I don't know what y'all done heard about me
But I'm a C-R-I-P with some P-I-M-P too

Pockets pad up, they come from Brinks
So what the ladies wink
You the one in the Mercedes
Shotgun with the thing
Coat chillin', watching ""The Lion King""
Crying and thangs
Cause I'm with Snoop and Nate - singing, rhyming and things
I'm out late cause I'm rhyming for change
I ain't with dime for dames
Hop back and I'm trying to aim
At everything, that be hating my fame
Since regulating, been lacing the game
Ain't no mistake in the game
Two-one mother f'in dwizzle sippin on the sizzle
And that's for shizzle
Four times for the riddles
You know these bars
Everywhere we go
You know who us are
You could tell by the car
Champagn, caviar
Bubble bath, I say I love you...
And I laugh

Everything that you want I got it don't worry
And I know it ain't about the chips
Just my way of sayin thanks for the years you put up with my shit
I had to change like the chorus said
And I'm reminded why everytime we do our thing in the waterbed
To me this is more than head

Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them
Something to remember, yell out
Timber when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale

But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail, on the low ho

Come on lady, dance all around me

Now what goes up, must come down (shiiett)
But we ain't coming down, it be them same ol' clowns
Aiming your pound, pretending they proud
But when you leave town they go around they running they mouth (maaann)
They something like a hater, man
Talking bad about a playa as if I'm not gon' see ya later, man
You constantly frontin' until you confronted on
If you don't like whats going on goin' to another song
'Cause I keep a hater guilty
My cars and my money all alike man, both them filthy (get it?)
From skimpy and empty to fuel on full
See I be high when my 'Ca-go Bulls
Obey no rules to school you fools

And the Young Dude done paid young dudes' dues dude

And I will never have to borrow
Got my first car when I turned sixteen
Only drove it home outta town limousines
Plus we was broke wit a deal but nobody could tell
So we did what we had to do for ""Country Grammar"" to sell
Haha, I stay on my own melodies
Plus I like my booties and my boobs like a capital letter 'B'
That's how it is, how it better be
I preferably rather have two or three girls in the bed wit' me
Close your ears, ma, you ain't heard nothing (what?)
I always pay ma, let a brother hold something
I'm basically coming from nothing to something
When I say nothing meaning pocket full of lint and buttons

Stop a hotter teen went from nada to a lot of things

People always saying man it must be nice
No hi, no nothing, not a simple house life
Understand the money's good but I'm still from the hood
So don't be asking for no ""inch"" and be expecting the ""foot""
Unless you want a foot (whoo!)
I know a few crooks that can place you where you need to be put
And it might not cost me playa
Got a Benz pepper interior, paint salty playa
And we all push it, but me I push it real good
Brains blown out, chromed out, wheel real wood
Catch me on your local derrty
Or in the studio doing vocals derrty
I'm the same dude that came through wit my crew

And um, all I need is JD beat to be banging
And I'll come up wit these verses that I'm usually slanging

The way niggas act, you would think j.lo in the lobby
Or, maybe beyonce maybe ashanti
The way i feel ma i need a fiance
The type of love that will last foreva

Wanna play wanna laugh together

Tryna get lil' mami, in that thang of reese

Oh the sentence on my necklace seem invisible too
When we do what we do, we can't be visible boo

While I'm laying back, smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther

From the Chi, and I be sipping Hennessy
Play some R&B while I smoke a B
You can't fuck with me, put that on a G
And all is (Well well well well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers?
Hit the stop light, get into some Isley's
The rims still moving so I'm bumping a little Spinners
While I'm smoking on a B, dipping through the streets
Bumping R&B, and I got the heat on them 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
Put my Earth in the Wind smokin' Fire
Let me get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze with Maze
Fulfilling our every temptation, slow-jamming, having deep sex
You Ready for the World, girl? Come on over
Make me touch you all over your body, baby don't say no to me
And every moment you controlling me
I'm loving the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back to the melody of ""Roll It Slow""
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last

Last time I saw you
You was brewed up, booed up, ready for a new fuck
Last time you saw me
I was P.I. to the mothafuckin' M.P., what?
And lately I heard you's a broke bitch
Livin in the lower class suburb
And lately the word is I live in a suburb
And I don't fuck with birds
She used to pump on the block
Sell a nigga rocks, bail a nigga out, but
She tried to plot on a nigga
Vacant lot one shot bitch died go figure
He used to pay this bitch
Gave her lots of shit, fuck's wrong with this nigga, man?
He used to bring her through the hood
Treat the bitch too fuckin good, my opinion
We used to blaze with the bitch
Faded off the lick she x-rated the clip
This nigga bought braids for the bitch
Louis Vuitton kicks and tricked on some sucka shit
Meanwhile in the hood she drivin around good
This bitch thinks she's in Hollywood
Meantime she settin the nigga up
Telling us what his stuff she's ready to get him stuck, what?

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Thick thighs but she full of surprises
I swear this bitch is Shady (That's what I know)
Sex on her mind all the time
And you think that that's your baby (You don't know)
You a good guy that's living a lie
But she told 'em where your safe be (It's what I know)
If you cool and she satisfied
How come that bitch just paged me? (You don't know)

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
We had to ride on a nigga, watch him
For the right time to get richer
We decided when the hit was
Run up on him, 45 in the ribs, what?
This nigga screamed like a bitch
Showed us where his shit, hit a hell of a lick
But the bitch, who told us 'bout the bricks
Exposed us to the nigga, he knew that we'd come
But meanwhile in his hood
His niggas is suiting up and Timbed, looted up
Rims and new trucks your man livin' it up
Then a van with no hubs suddenly pulled up and erupt
Shot a nigga the fuck up, just my luck
The bitch got us both touched, it's like a rush
The bitch who blushed and smoked blunts with us
Turned out to be nuts, switched up
Mixed up with the wrong slut
Got my frame zipped up in the bag, it's all bad
My niggas got my back, in fact
They caught on her Ave, flossin in another nigga cab

Thick thighs but she full of surprises

Come put it in my life

[Verse 1: Juvenile]
Its that nigga Juve, from the Magnolia, still loc'in
You hoes know what's happenin' with me, bust that pussy open
Loose titty, loose booty, round down and up
If a gangsta can't touch it, what you bouncin it fu'
Now give me leadway, watch how a G play
Watch how my name get caught up in he and she say
It's UTP day, we what the streets made,
They represent us when they hear us at the DJs!
Break bread with me, nigga, is you mad with me?
Thought we was people, y'all supposed to spend ya cash with me
I mean ya last with me, hold me down
Give me a whip, give me a bitch, and let her blow me down!
I'm so gutta, I'm so slick, I'm so grimy
I promise you something, and I bet you ya don't find me,
Look, I'mma eat, purchase whatever I please
CO, give me the ki's or a brick, I need two of these!

[Hook] (2x)

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
I'mma be so courageous, and so contagious
'Til my fuckin rap sheets gonna receive mo' pages

Don't you see the soldiers and vogues when I appear mon (appear mon)
About bein written on my face cause I don't fear none (don't fear none)
Me and my team got a scheme to go light the block up
Skip's movin' the work, and Wacko poppin' the chopper
I scream the ""U"" cause I mean it
The difference is you be throwin yo' shit up when you scream it - I seen it!
Shit all the obstacles that I been through
What made you think, I'mma be scared of a bitch like you?
I'm ya dawg, let me get it on consignment
You ain't paid them last people yet, dawg, don't even remind me
I gained knowledge, my game polished and it's obvious
You can't block it, you can't knock it, this is profit!

[Hook] (2x)

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
Can I untape the clips and chill?
Show my niggas it's real?
Can my people shop in Beverly Hills?
I got a lot of work I know that's gonna be ahead of me still
But my beast mentality gon' keep me ahead of the field!
Pardon me, but I got paper to chase
Now cut through the talking and bring me straight to the safe
I know where the cameras at and I'm destroying the tape
I'm not leaving no evidence for the forensic to trace,
I got a problem on my hand, a few bills I ain't been payin'
I figured about a lil' less than 75 grand
And my dog Rocky caught a nickel for a pistol
Its serious when the federales comin' to get you!
Life is at a standstill out here in this damn field
What you say can get you and ya mans killed
It's my last chance to come up, its gotta be it
Juvi comin' out, the first-round lottery pick!

With my son cashin a check so I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world of I we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye Moma looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about his girls style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual walks threw the park
Candle light dinners by dark, I'm thinking smart
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, clutch and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff Dropped her off and told her call me up (ring noise)
We could talk, conversate about the lyric  subject whatevers starts

I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my lovin
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm lovin' how you look in my eyes, swangin' them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tattooed on that ass baby
Jump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple, but you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number
She got me feelin' like, maybe she the wrong woman
Think I'm a be chasin' the chickenhead, you're on somethin'
Your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I'll have you doin' what you said that you won't do
Make a decision shorty, good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keeps showing me that thong
Before I head home I'm a stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on, holla at your boy

[Hook: Joe]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Bitches be frustrated with a baller, wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her
It gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know that we friends and nuttin more
She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hittin the ground, just enough to hold us down
I'm stickin and movin, cruisin after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special I let her call my by my government name
Her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?
Surroundin me, houndin me, tryin to be my only
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your homey

[Hook: Joe]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Yeah
Don't know what fuck me up more: watchin her lick her lips
Or watchin' her walk; she hypnotized me with her hips man
I sweet talk her if she like
Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right?
Look, I'm legit now; I used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefits of world tours
Big house, big Benz - girl it's yours
Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws
You ain't got to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't indulge in my past; fuck what happened before you
Cause it means somebody's gonna hate you that never saw you
Come here- let me touch on you; I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you; you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you, and you can ride on
We can do it all tonight, we can have a ball tonight

Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair.""
‘Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
‘Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve

Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy

Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this.""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us

We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause, fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it

Don't matter if I'm behind her, as long as I'm inside her
She be wit it and I don't wanna be commited
As long as I don't forget it, the night after I hit it
She cool mayn, neva disrespectin' me
As long as I can help her wit a few Bill Belamys
And she ain't even tellin' me I'm the only dertty she dig
And if she do I'mma tell em how we better off bein friends

Slow down for me, you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm trying to grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and Ima make you get of me

So stop stunting slow motion for a real nigga

Would I be violating if I grab me a handfull
I know what's happening all I want is a sample
Who you with, I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on hoes, dawg the more for the weed
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me

Now turn it up, turn it up, a little louder
Turn it up, turn it up, little louder
Now turn it up, can't live my, I, I can't live my
I can't live my, I, I can't live
Now turn it up, turn it up

[Verse 1: Evidence]
Yeah, yo I can't live my I, I can't live my
Life this way, continually get high
Instead of running 'round, lock one bird down
It's a new day, gotta do it big just to get right
Show no respect can't live that way
You hold my check, can't live that way
Without my chick on deck, can't live that way
They say what they like, but I've been that way
Our moves calculated through the lens, almost here
Success will be the best revenge
Man, from Clint East' to Kanye West
The sun can't chill but everyday it sets (Evidence!)

[Hook: Choir + (Female Choir)]
This time I made up my mind
This time I'm back on my grind
I know there's things in my life
That I'mma let go starting tonight
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
(I can't live my, I, I can't live my)
I can't live my, I, I can't live my

I can't live my life this way

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
My favorite girl wanna leave me just because I got a girlfriend
My freak girl told me now, she a Christian
My White girl wanna move back to Michigan
I'm pulling girls off the bench like a sixth man
I'm in the club doing the same ol' two step
While Omegas doing the same ol' ""Q"" step
I have my money on my mind, I was thinking green
She a pledge A.K.A., she was pink and green
I want a good girl, she want a gentleman
We saying the same thing like a synonym
I wasn't really spitting game I was scrimmaging
My penmanship so hard it needs censorship
I'm a Chicagoan till Chicago ends
Till we blow like Chicago wind
I don't know what's better, getting laid or getting paid
I just know when I'm getting one, the other's getting away
This way

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rakaa Iriscience]
Go 'head, flip a coin so the game can start
Believe I know the drama, kid name the part
I learned before the hot flame came the spark
It's like before the pop fame came to 'Pac
But this industry'll play with your life man
They playing with your rent, food, water and lights man
That's why Rakaa brings it like that ol' Toddy Tee jam
The Batterram then I'm off to Amsterdam
To rest up for strength to deal with this weight
To deal with these deals, to deal with this hate
I dedicate this Jam Master Jay
Run-D.M.C. showed me how to walk, this way

Up in here, it's burning hot

Shorty take it off if it get to hot, up in this spot

We get loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire fire fire

[Verse 1]
Now I ain't putting nothing out, I smoke when I wanna
26-inch chrome spokes on the Hummer
This heat gon last for the whole summer
Running your bitch faster then the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
Im buying diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinning is your ear
Yeah, im riding with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
Im 80s man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists getting raw deals
Im only 21, sitting on mills

[Verse 2]
If you know anything about me, then you know im a baller
If I ain't hit the first night, I ain't gon call her
Im trying to play, you trying to have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care bout what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't putting no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't spend quarters
So cut the games ma, lets go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when im riding through the town
Like em small, like em tall, like em black, like em brown
She gotta be able to come when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&B diva
Bitch say something, I ain't a mind reader

Mother of pearl delivery, voice of God
And it's hard just being the boss
Being I can't go to jail cause them years will cost me
Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
Rather just sit back and roll a dutch
Think about how I'mma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'mma get the 'caine over Customs
Never underestimate niggas or over trust them
Uh yeah them M's is right in my face
I just got to throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the Tech will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
And I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't shake the devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what

All you shooting is the breeze, a bootleg uzi
I'm just waiting on a q like Suzie, don't lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else that'll make something melt
You just got to feel the kid
If not rap for the fact of how real he is, what up

Aiyo, niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just want to rock for a century

Life's a bitch like the mother from Blow, let's go
Don't make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck riding the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track
Hop out looking crispy, fresh and new
In the six, but it's a BM, and it's Pepsi blue
And, I don't know you
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through

Of how I'm gonna change the game, so don't get out of line

And Hot Atlanta y'all is one of the best
Where they speak Southern slang and smoke la cess
And New York women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine it's so selfish

Seperate the great, from the weak freaks

Shorty, where you been?
Feels like a long time
Long, long time since I seen you
Yes it has, girl
And I know I said some fucked-up things to you before
But girl you know I didn't mean it
I never meant one single word
If I could take back every word I would and more for sure
If I thought that you would believe it
Hey, girl, cause you make my life so convenient for me

Maannn, these bitches is awfully nasty
And these bitches keep walking past me
Either way, I'm a pimp for today
Put your bootie in the way and shake that shit!
(Now these niggas is bout they bank)
(And these niggas keep buying dranks)
(Lips creep from my body on your lips)
(Get it closer to the tip and shake that shit!)

[Verse 1 - Shawnna]
S-H-A to the W double N-A
Real bitch don't play
Your eyes can't hide what your lips won't say
You're acting like the Dukes of the Fifth won't spray
It's okay, they gon learn
Chi's most wanted bitch wait your turn!
Sac full of yum I'm a make that burn
Y'all can't smoke none anyway
Wild ones, walk wit a bitch through wild slums
Trying to figure out if they're scared of the hips or the chips
Or they really can't talk to a bitch wit wild guns
No games, hat to the side wit low frame
Now I came in this industry killin em
Now they all feeling me, sipping on Henny wit an O and a gram!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Shawnna]
C-H-I to the C-A, G-O
If you ain't been, don't go
My city's so fast, you react so slow
Your heart might stop and your blood won't flow
(That ain't right) I stomp through the hood
Wit a grand on my feet like that ain't tight
Diamonds on my neck like that ain't bright
I come through and shut down the Saturday Night!
(Hell yeah) You can kiss that and
(Feel there) bring it right back
Don't mess wit the frame if you don't know a thing
Six years in the game, I'm still here
Hold up! They mad cause the streets is sold up!
I'm back on my feet, so watch for the cops, we'll never stop
Just rep for ya block and throw it up!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Shawnna]
M-I-D to the W-E-S-T
Better yet that's me
Most of y'all chicks gotta impress me
You say you got skills, put 'em up let's see
Show and prove, I hate to really see
What y'all goin through, put on any beat
We could spit it in the street
From the West to the East, or South to the house
Just showing love, go home
The body on the flo' is so grown
What cha gon' do, when you call to ya label
And ya gotta shed a tear, cause you hear ya career's
Been post-poned, back up
Smart mouth bitches, get slapped up
Take it to the trap, get clapped up
Put it in ya brain that the female game, been wrapped up

[Chorus x2]

[Outro - Shawnna]
Shorty said, shorty said

Wait a minute, hold up

Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up, now wait a minute

Fuck around and knock the hair up off your chest (Beeyaa!)
My shocks from your brain, threw a fucked up mess
Unless, I put the potato on the end of the barrel
And watch your soul fly with the sparrow (Baaahh!)
Call me Pharoah Guerilla, my parcels is sleek
And sometimes I wear Chinchillas (Zo)

The start of the destruction
Assisted by trombones and percussions
Their ushering, a new millennium
My mind process raps like a Pentium (Blaahh!)
Anyone, anyhow, and anyway
Niggas get fucked up when the mini sprays
Yes he ran away with shells stuck up in his back
He fucked up with Black
Got hit up with the Mack
Best to stick to act, don't act nauseous

Hello, five for ten?
Jim? Great news great news great news, I just saved a bunch of money on wardrobe by switching to White Tee's

Yep in my white tee, yup in my white tee

[Hook]
I slang in my white tee, I bang in my white tee
All in the club spittin game in my white tee
I bling in my white tee, serve fiends in my white tee
Fuck a throwback I look clean in my white tee
I slang in my white tee, I bang in my white tee
All in the club spittin game in my white tee
I bling in my white tee, serve fiends in my white tee
Fuck a throwback I look clean in my white tee

[Verse 1]
Step on the scene with some green and some hard white work
Real clean fresh jeans and a all white shirt
We all get money and we all smoke purp'
Hit the dirt, one squirt'll leave all ya'll murk
Cause I'm fresh in my white tee, they glance at my white tee
And I got that hat that match my pants and my white tee
Whoever that you might see, I know they got a white tee
Homeboy, brother, sister, mother, daddy or your wifey
Hanes or Fruit of Loom be the name of my white tee
I gotta change mane it's a stain on my white tee
Lames in a white tee, I bring the pain in my white tee
Hispanic, white, niggas even yangs wearing white tees
Hit the club deep and we all got a white tees
A throwback, no gat, hell naw that don't excite me
You don't need no throwback cause you will be set on your white tee
You can get a circle or a v neck on your white tee

[Hook]
I slang in my white tee, I bang in my white tee
All in the club spittin game in my white tee
I bling in my white tee, serve fiends in my white tee
Fuck a throwback I look clean in my white tee

[Verse 2]
Well I hit the mall in my white tee, ohh I think they like me
Or they like them diamonds cause they shine so brightly
Yeah you know how I be up under my tee it's that wifey
Fo'fo' tucked tightly for them niggas who think I'm soft
Nigga come and try me, they gon' find yo' body
White tees in the club and while we drinking on Bacardi
Fuck throwbacks, white tees in party
Now don't get me started, gotta try record it
Bullshit we avoid it
Everyone wear white tees, cause they can afford it
Girls wear white tees, boys wear white tees
Niggas in the trap nigga bet they got a white tee
I wear a white tee, you wear a white tee
The next day catch me with a brand new white tee
Ohh that boy there clean, white shoes fresh jeans
But on that boy shirt what it say? Not a thing

[Hook]
I slang in my white tee, I bang in my white tee
All in the club spittin game in my white tee
I bling in my white tee, serve fiends in my white tee
Fuck a throwback I look clean in my white tee

[Verse 3]
I gotta couple throwbacks, it's just I choose not to wear 'em
White tee extravaganza nigga like a Foot Locker sale
Niggas think I done failed, but my paper stackin a lot
Or you can throw-back this, but partner check my knot
And all my ghetto gangstas white tee, laws gone hate ya
With street game and a little fame them hoes gonna chase ya
Can't escape bro, this white done covered the map
Like crack did in the eighties, it took over the trap
Come to the hood you can find me trapping in my white tee
Standing with a full grill niggas might try me
So high, I bem still in my white tee
Rock jeans tiger green yeah hoes like me
Haters try to bite me, some try to dislike me
Became a rich nigga and the feds try to indict me

You feel so good
Rest of my life I wish I could
Hold you tight and take a flight out the hood
Was I foul or just misunderstood?
Mild-mannered or up to no-good
It really doesn't matter, either way I should
Maximize the moment and hold ya close
Jump in the drop spider and cruise down the coast
Who loved you the most?
I was never ghost
When lives was on the line
Confusion in ya mind
Runnin outta time
Drama of all kind
But there's faith in our mind
We're spiritually inclined
Sometimes I flip
Sometimes you flip
Sometimes we wild out and act like lunatics
We movin too fast, the whole world's in a rush
Everybody just hush..

Its all a test; the pain, the drama
The villa in the bahamas
The highs, the lows
The hooptie, the Rolls
The money flowin
Certain doors that we go in
The people we meet, the hands that we shake
Whether its Morton's or Sizzler steak
But everything will be okay
[W/ 7 Aurelius] if we do it my way
Cuz I believe in romance
Kissin while ya slow dance
Me bouncin baby? no chance
No matter the circumstance
Whatever it takes gurl, ill swim to France
Cuz ya beauty's unmatched
Such a great catch
Unconditional love, forever we are attatched
Deal with the drama, we can find our way back
With or without the Maybach..

Walkin thru the desert in the ice cold rain
Want you in my life and nothing's gonna change

But thats many years from now so don't rush

[Intro: Akon]
1, 2, 3 - ooh yea
Ooh oh-oh...
I hope you don’t mind, I hope you don’t mind
That I put down in words... how won-der-ful life is

[Verse 1]
Hey Tip, lemme holla at ya...
Making yo momma proud, looking in yo daughter’s eyes
Kickin it with your sons, trippin, never realize
How good you got it, been so wrapped up in yo losses
You couldn’t see the profits, could still be in the projects
Instead releasing projects just poppin when niggas floppin
So you went back to prison TIP, it could've been a coffin
Now since we talkin, you been trippin ever since I died
Appreciate you missin me but G, you still alive
I’m lookin down at you, and sendin smiles to you
I checked the wedding out, oh tell Tamika hi would you?
Told you she would get you, that’s good cuz shawty ride with you
Kids getting big, seen King riding a bicycle
See Niq Niq drive a car, see Bubba big as you
I see Domani rappin, and he’s spittin too
Little Deyjah beautiful, and Major supercool
My life is over with dawg, your life is good to you

[Hook: Akon]
And you can tell everybody, this is your song
And you can tell everybody, this is your song
I hope you don’t mind, I hope you don’t mind
That I put down in words... how won-der-ful life is

[Verse 2]
Sit down, son...
And listen to me son, and pay attention to me
Seems like I’m the only one that you would listen to
I never knew the time that I ain’t get to spend with you
Would ever result in you making yourself miserable
You gotta let it go, it’s painful, I already know
The past is the past, just learn from the grown
So you got crystal wit you? And your sister Precious too
I’m proud of you, did better than I expected you to
Although I knew you was special when you was smaller
That’s why I was so much harder on you, knew you were smarter
Not much convo to offer, I wasn’t much of a talker
Great to see you doin better than me, even as a father
Taking care of yo mama, overcoming the drama
Your life is wonderful son, don’t let em take it from you
Keep living it to the fullest, treasure it, it’s a blessing
Be thankful for all this beauty, when it’s over with forget it

[Hook: Akon]

[Verse 3]
Damn...
What up, Phil? So good to hear from you, we missing you (f'real)
Remembering all of our conversations, daily reminiscing you
The hood, today they lost, can tell they don't know who to listen to
Today I watch over Jeanette like she was my own and that could missing you
I swear it’s so unfair that I’m right here and you up there
I miss you so much now to the point I call your name but you not there
Now I can’t rest and I can’t do shit off my mind, I’m so upset
It wasn’t your time to beat me there, broke my heart to see you dead
Shot with bullets that were meant for me, familiy's never forgiving me
I know, but all I could do was follow your memory
But pops I thank you so much for leaving, I had to grow up
Slanging crack on the corner ain’t quite the future you wanted for me
Was it? And this pain I feel it never goes away
Does it? This load I carry get no lighter
I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home
Taught me everything I’ve known, owe you everything I own
I must admit you raised a warrior, my life could be a story book
Hope you proud of me, didn’t graduate from college but
Thanks for listening to me, so long, had this bottled up
Til we meet in person let’s keep speaking through my verses for life

[Hook: Akon]

Big chips! (Woo!) We off in Vegas drinkin and partyin
We got chicks in swimsuits modelin
We in the twin stretch Maybachs dippin low
The way the wrist shine it's so magical
You know them boys got the clubs out of control (Ho!)
Nigga what ya heard it's Kells and Hov
With the second comin of Best Of Both
In the first week I predict a million sold, we talkin...

[Verse 1: Jay-Z] (R. Kelly)
Big chips! Big trips to Vegas nigga
Big cribs and the whips is spacious (Uh huh)
Any day they could dig your grave
Shit, So Big is my inspiration, dig
No reward that's the risk is taken
In which case you niggas wouldn't wanna switch places
I on the other hand relish the situation
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet
I overhauled it you wouldn't recognize it
From the time that I bought it I just replaced it
I risk cases for shit like this, nigga I pray for some shit like this
Word to my Uncle Ray, who gave us life for some shit like this
Ma you rollin I'm as real as it gets

[Hook: R. Kelly]

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Big chips! I can't take this
The way you move your ass slow like Matrix
You make me wanna toss chips in Vegas
Before I toss chips first, get naked
I can't fake it, girl you got the club shut down when you freak it
Superstar honey, so mean and vicious
Got a lot and comin, I'm so mean and vicious
Bark bark farmer, this chicken layin platinum ex-farmer (preach!)
So go low mama, give it a go
As I punch 170 on stretch roads, must turn up the radio!
Girl you so good I'm swervin like whoa! whoa!
Uh oh! Uh uh oh! from the club to the stretch
Out the stretch to the Hotel, into the hotel suite!

[Hook: R. Kelly]

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Big chips! I'm a boss I said
Tilt my hat and I cross my legs
Like old ladies at the park, I toss my bread
And the pigeons start flockin, ballin' like Bishop Loughlin
And stick Cochran on any DA, to try to stop him
So any gunplay that is an option
I been doin this since niggas was woppin
Rockin Izods with the matchin socks, and
Slap boxin in the back park and when the girls start watchin
Try to get real, you had to drop 'em
See I ain't never been a fronter
Or fake it till I make it tight nigga ma I don't want ya number
Either you're comin or I one ya
Either you know what you want ma, I don't even want ya
You play pretty if you wanna

[Hook: R. Kelly]

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
All around the world, stop where the sun sets
Spendin big chips you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)
You wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)
Say we goin around the world, stop where the sun sets
Spendin big chips you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)
Do you wanna go (Uh oh, uh uh oh!)

[Outro: R. Kelly]
Uh, come on, Tone, I see ya, Jigga, Kells, uh, yeah, Track Masters

Yeah, yeah

And that's why I can offer, similarities in our characters
Haven't you heard the word 'round town? How I get down
They gon' whistle, everybody part is official
And that ass wit' you, got my dick as hard as a missile
Don't hop on top, cause I ride around with a pistol
If they pull us over, I'll be out of town with an issue
If you was mine, I'd introduce you to mama girl
You're stylin' in your boots and Gabbana, I'm so used to your Prada
I take trips cause out in Houston it's hotter
Throw in that Al Green and juice the Impala
Make my jewels and my collar
You had me feelin' like a fool when I hollered

I could tell you feel the same cause when I asked you laughed
So I'mma leave it at that, take a hint and put in my math
I imagine, you probably look twice as good in the bath
And I'm buggin' cause I can see you right in the hood when I pass
I'm never stable cause business is on my ass
But you could be the one that I visit before I dash
And I admit, I've been the type to hit and split
But you can't blame me for the females that I been gettin' with

Brushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright

I'll accept it any way that I can, cause I ain't your man
I'll try for whatever it's worth
Just remember who played who first

[Verse 3]
It seems like your attitude, only appears when I'm mad at you
When several situations occur and that includes
When I'm gone too long, ridin' through them avenues
As soon as I get home there's rumors and scattered news
You know my fantasies, am I feelin' things or can this be
Your girlfriend tryin' to sandwich me
My heart's colder than sandwich meat
Cause I, come from the hood where the hammers be
I move fast with a switch pace
And pop a Listerine strip in, before you get all up in a bitch face
Movin' your body like this
Gon' make me blow like a bottle of Crist'
Man I don't know no one hotter than Twist
You got my temperature risin'
From your hips and your thighs and
And that glare in your eyes'll brighten up a horizon
It comes naturally, I don't bribe 'em
It's as easy as one, two, three and I slide in

Brushed off every time I tried, but I'm alright

You was there when I was on the bench hurtin'
Now that I own my team
Its only right that I condone my queen
Try to show her my dream
And I can't let her get lost now
She carries the money, the hammer, and material across town
And understand she fine
Understand she mine
She understand the grind
Cooks, clean, and irons
And whatever shes wanna push I'mma cosign
And if I ain't got it already than I'mma go find it
I guess I'mma lucky don, and shes a lucky queen
Cause her jewelry box look likes Lucky Charms
All color stones
And she know that I'm in the hood, but she also knows that I'm coming home
Mr. Raspy, thought I was in love with money
'Til the first time we getting nasty

Uh yo, Whatever the road to paradise is we on it

Those were the days, these are the times
You held me down with nearly damn near everything, even my rhymes
I will play a song for you
And you will let me know exactly how the ladies will respond from a womens
Point of view
And that's why my girl is with me
I love it when she layin' in the bed with a Pearl Long Vickie
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she's real
Just imagine the way she smell and the way she feel
The sex was crazy then and crazy still
And you know I'm from the streets so its crazy ill
And we waiting on the new island
We been to all them 4, 5 times come on mommy you whilin

We got the four letters when it comes from the heart its more pleasure
And for the fact that you trust me still
Thus far I appreciate what we build
All the minks that I bought you that dragged the floor
And all the nights you sat up and bagged the roar
Damn I'm thinking that you gotta hate it
But yet and still you tolerate it
That's why ma we gotta make it

So take off them silly chains, put back on your wire

Let East Coast bang, let West Coast bang
And Rule gonna bring the ghetto gospel
To every hood possible, pushin' through in the sky blue
Back with the gods, you now, preferably the 4 pound
Slugs flying at the speed of sound
Tryin to catch the ears of niggas that's running their mouths
I might get my Brooklyn niggas to run in your house
I don't really understand what the runnin's about
But we're hunters, we take pride in airin' our prey out

And everybody talkin' crazy how their AK spit
But we done did some investigating, and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth, homie. Got the industry shook like, ""Naw, nigga, Joe gonna let 'em loose on me""
True story, I'm bringing the team back
Even Roy Jones was forced to Lean Back
My nigga Dre said grind cook. Now we killin them hard, niggas said I must've found Pun's rhyme book

I swear it couldn't be sweeter, life's a bitch
Depending on how you treat her, you might get rich
It's guaranteed you gonna die, you might get missed
For maybe two or three hours, 'til they light their spliffs
And that coke will get you a long time, but when I let 'em know the dope is out, it's like America Online
Wise has awoken, and you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open
I still hold the title
Because I'm in the hood like them little motorcycles
Stick up kids hoppin' out with them old rifles, just doing shit for nothing, it's so spiteful, ha, I'm just like you

And I'm not cocky, I'm confident

This your boy Mr. Funkadelic, what's the business baby
I've been eyeing you all day in the mall miss lady

But anyway, gone and drop a number or something
So I can call you later on,on your phone or something
Take you home, and maybe we could bone or something
It's no limits to what we do, cause tonight we cutting, gut busting
I'm digging in your walls something viscious
With your legs to the ceiling, catch a nut someting serious

With your pretty brown skin, like almond joys and kisses

The first time I called, you were juggling on my balls
In and out of your jaws, I was beating down your walls
Had your ass breaking laws for a player was the cause
And every time you seen a G you was slipping off your drawers, I recall
I met your ass at the mall, in the fall
You the one with the dress on, let me take you home
Show your ass how to buss a nut, up in the guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut

135 petite, and your smell is unique
Maybe we can exchange numbers and hook up in the week
Oh, You a freak, I knew it from the first time I saw you
The way you played with your tongue, I knew right then I would call you
So what it is, they call me Super Don from the ville
And I'mma tell you like this, cause a nigga so real, and stay trill
Cause all I wanna do is just drill, with that ass in the air, and the pussy I kill
And I feel, you love to fuck up on a hill

I almost crashed my truck, and spilled my Hen' dawg
Yes you, God blessed you, I was trying to get next to you
Your homegirls was hating, but I didn't care
You said you had a man, I was like ""where?""
It was something so different about you
I felt so gifted around you
Even though you had a man and all
I took the chance to call, we held hands at the mall
That day was so special to me
Your man left you at Mickey D's
You called me, I scooped you up
I seen fear in your eyes, the tears in your eyes
He can't hug you like I hug you
Better yet love you like this thug do

I'm having the time of my life
Felt the world on wheels, you and your homegirl got some skills
Nobody make me feel like you do
Or better yet real like you, I messed around and killed dude
I seen home-girly just flossin, we made eye contact
Dude always is flossin, me never
You and B-l-a-c-k forever, tattered on my neck in green letters
Late night eating Haagen-Dazs, watching Uncut
And me sitting there, playing wit your butt
Took off your clothes, I hit it on the counch
Even though mom's in the house
Nothing could replace this feeling
It's like winning 2 million, our bond closer than Cicilians
I know old boy won't leave you alone
I know you love him, but our love is strong

I couldn't leave well enough alone
Hell I had to hit ya cell phone
I left you a message, it went like this, ""I love you, mmmuah!""
I guess it's my luck, I goes to the Magic
Damn, ain't that his truck?
I guess you wit him, screw him
If it wasn't for you, I'd have to do him
You seen 'em at Jack In The Box
He was mackin a lot, to some rats in a drop
Now you call The Beat and The Power, dedicate songs every hour
All hell done broke loose

Likes to have a good time and
Try new things

Yippie Yippie, Yum Yum
Goodie goodie gum drop
Put me in a tongue lock
Did it till my body went numb, numb
Laid her on her back, back
Turned her round, gave her bottom a smack, smack
She's a woman from the block with the best of weed
But I won't stop till I'm pullin out tracks, tracks
It was lust at first sight
And she couldn't help sayin that she wanted to get with me
And my size was just right
Cuz she wanted a man with a little sec-ur-ity
Said I been around the world twice
And my name ring bells from Atlanta to Sic-i-ly
Said she wanted it all night
So put the bubbles in the tub and Ludacris and me

[Hook] - 2X

Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeeeah Yeeeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah

[Trick Daddy]
Sweetie you look so incredible
So delicious and so damn edible
All I need is some honey or syrup
With a lil' butter to rub down all your curves
And no need for the lemonade
Just a twist of lime and some grape Kool-Aid
Can I call you Caramel?
Cuz I'm bout to go coo-coo to taste your Coco Puffs
One bowl ought to fill me up
But that milk gotta be cold enough
So supper time that'll hold me up
I might choke myself if I don't slow it up, but
Honey, you look like a honeydew melon
Or strawberry with the whipped cream filling
Of the top part of the peach cobbler
But uh, the fruit platter ought to do me better

[Intro]
Killa! Baby!
Kanye this that 1970s Heron flow huh?
Yeah let's speed it up

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Ayo street mergers I legislated
The nerve I never hated
On murders pre-meditated
Absurd! I hesitated
Observe: cock and spray
Hit you from a block away
Drinking sake on a Suzuki we in Osaka Bay
Playing soccer, stupid, stay in a sucker's place
Pluck ya ace, take ya girl, fuck her face
She dealing with Killa so you love her taste
She swallowing Killa cause she love the taste
I got brought up with crooking
Kitchen orders that I'm cooking
But got caught up with the jooks you woulda thought I was from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
Did like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding
Now the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar
Interior, inferior, star-spangled banner
Car game bananas
My man Santana
Guns everywhere, like the car came with hammers

[Hook: Kanye West]
They trying to say he (down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest
The games in the nooses
Our girls is the models
They coochies the juiciest

Yeah, they say he (down, down)
Yeah, they say he (down, but not out)
Cause I’m back on my grind
Money back on my mind
Ye' and Killa Cam', the world is mine

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I treat bitches straight up, like Simon Says
Open vagina: put ya legs behind ya head
Cop me Air Ones, hon, lime and red
You got pets? Me too: mine are dead
Fox, minks, gators that's necessary
Accessories, my closet's a ""Pet Sematary""
I get approached by animal activists
I live in a zoo
I run scandals with savages
All my niggas get together to gather loot
Bodyguard for what? Dog, I'd rather shoot
I go to war, old Timbs, battered boots
Hand grenade, goggles and a parachute
Ya'll don't even know the name of my flip
It was ""Touch Me, Tease Me"" when Case was the shit
You don't know bout the cases I get:
Court case, briefcase, suitcase, cases of Cris

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Ayo you dealing with some sure shit
My bitches pure thick
Play razor tag, slice ya face, you're it!
It's I who come by drive-thru
Gator-toed Mauri, three quarters, sky blue
Look at mami: eyes blue, 5'2''
I approached her ""Hi boo, how you?
Pony skin Louis? Oh, you fly too
You a stewardess? Good ma, I fly too""
Now a nigga got baking to bake
Harlem Shake? Nah, I'm in Harlem shaking awake
Shaking to bake, shaking the Jakes
Kill you, shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake
Just ya picture though, you still taped in a lake
I'm laughing; you couldn't wait to escape
For anyone who owed the dough, I had to load the fo
I hoped a nigga heard when I said ""I told you so""

[Outro]
Mine
Killa you already know Harlem
Whole Midwest, Detroit, Nap town, St. Louis
Chicago of course
Westside, holla at me
Southside wild hundreds
You know what it is Ohio
Columbus, holla at ya boy
You know what else I do:
Dayton, Youngstown, Cleveland, Cincinnati

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Hook: 50 Cent + (The Game)]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[Verse 2: The Game]
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
Ten G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe you me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped, like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's ten years, I told Pooh in ninety-five
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

[Hook: 50 Cent + (The Game)]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
(Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me)

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

[Verse 3: The Game]
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My moms happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on, like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think: What if Marie Baker got that abortion? I love you, ma

[Hook: 50 Cent + (The Game)]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top

Can we please have a moment of silence
That's for my niggas doing years in confinement
And for my soldiers who passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get em
Can we please pour out some liquor
Symobolizing let's take in time to consider that
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep til slugs kill us here
This for my dawgs stuck in the struggle trying to gain
Smoking trauma, sniffing Ra while selling cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowing how to stop and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Blooding and thugging, folking and loking
Cryping and creeping, Latin and Kinging
Or just for poor righteous teaching

[Hook: Quan]
As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home

[Verse 2: Nas]
Yeah and can we have another moment of silence
For brothers who died from Black-on-Black violence
From here to the Dark Continent where rebels sell diamonds
To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dying
And can we please pour some more liquors
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy my niggas
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhyming Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hoping that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishing I was there with you
Let's take em home

[Verse 3: Quan]
And can we please have a moment to mourn
For Pac, Biggie and Pun, cause through us they live on
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah and Aaliyah
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we hope to see ya
Can we please have a moment for children
Who got raped or murdered or trapped in the system
Who never knew their father, never learned to dream
But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends
For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad
Busting her ass to give her kids shit she never had
For my niggas in the pen hoping rhymes'll get em signed
So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime
For every mother that held a son in the street bleeding
Crying a song of sorrow to dark and deep for speaking
Just a moment outside the day to day struggle
To let the ones we really care about know that we love em

And I brought, and I brought
And I brought dreams, dreams, dream
And I brought you all my dreams
It's 'cause I love you
I love you, I love you
Aah

[Verse 1]
I woke up out that coma 2001
'bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin, wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (dream)
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmaking and rapping
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
And it's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

[Hook]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

[Verse 2]
I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mya
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

[Hook]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

[Verse 3]
The dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece, like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun

[Hook]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (dream)
Aaliyah had a (dream), Left Eye had a (dream)
So I reached out to Kanye and (I brought you all my dreams)
(Cause I love you, I love you, I love you)

[Outro: The Game + Jerry Butler]
This song is dedicated to Yetunde Price
The sister of Venus and Serena Williams
Who was slain during a gang shootout in Compton
Sunday, September 14th, 2003: rest in peace

Hey girl how you doin'?
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
And I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name?
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange (heyy)
See I'm the man of this town
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me
We got, people to meet and many places to see (heyy)
Mm, I'm really diggin' ya lips
But be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips
Cause I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin' a crash
With your traffc jam booty heads pausin' so fast (heyy)
I would'nt trade you for the world I swear it

And how the colors cordinate with your clothes
From your manicured nails to your pedicured toes

Yeah, you hear the song so dance
Don't always think I'm tryna get in your pants
Cause see me my pimpin's in 3D

Tryna show ya how you livin' is trife
How many guys you know can bring the travel channel to life
One day we on the Autobahn, swervin drivin
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands
If you with me ain't no time to sleep
Especially at Wet Willies on Miami Beach
But I drive you off and pay you no attention
If make it to Atlantas Brina Brothers convention
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours
Makin' sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard
Hawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see
So if yo ass don't show up it's more women for me (heyy)

I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican Day Parade
Then at night I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest
In Mardi Gras all the women tryna show me they chest (heyy)
I'm in Jamaica spendin massive bucks
While the ladies all beggin' me to mashatuck
I had, sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans
Now it's all happy endings on my lap in Japan (heyy)
I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago (ugh)
Oh yet and still
You wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil
(But where the best at?) Ain't no need of even askin' brah
The best women all reside in Africa, and that's real

Ladies and gentlemen as we ride out
Could we have all the real pimps
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air?
Now ladies look around with me
Let's see if we can weed some of these niggas out
Cause it's no way that all these niggas could be pimpin'
Now if you happen to see a nigga
With two sweat patches up under his arms
Look like he been swimmin' in shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga ""put your hands down""
If you smell like you been at work all day and your car
Please ""put your hands down""
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body
Please say ""put your hands down""
If your spinnin' rims spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin'
If you are dancin' on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And you do not see a woman in sight
Guess what? You guessed it - you are not pimpin
If your Vodka and Cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass
""Put your hands down""
Now look down, look down
I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time
Okay, you see the nigga with the white socks

And they can't take off they drawers
Ain't standin' now, nigga naw!

Freaky ways, she can shake ass for days
Getting kinky in 69 different ways
Jump on stage she gets paid, so hold off

Look at that: I tought I taw a puttycat

Like
Bam, bam, bam, bam
Wham, wham

Shorty gettin' crunk, love gettin' low
Love it when she take it to the toe
Make that booty roll
Take her clothes off for cheese, love smokin' weed
And she getting hella freaky on the ecstacy
Do her dance for me, song after song
Shorty won't stop, she goin' all night long
Now that's a girl who know what she want and like
She a schoolgirl by day and a stripper by night

When they hear the kid in the house they're like, ""Oh no""

Got 'em sipping on that juice and gin
You could find me in the background burning that Backwood
Styling and stunting, doing my two step fronting
Now I'mma tell you what Em told me, homey
Just lose the parental discretion's advised, this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumping, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumping, cause I'm sick with flow
You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's for sure
I got the info you already know
Man I get it popping in the club, everybody show me love, let's go

I need that, grind in my system P, on my side twisting
In the club today for the chick to go both
Ways, let me see that ID just for proof
With the drink til the burn is gone
Hit the dancefloor like a scene from soft porn
Before it pop, make em sign a disclaimer
Try to get me on some pop shit these tricks will frame ya
But, in any event, keep fucking with 50 it makes sense
Cents, into them dollars, the hoes wanna holler
But you lookin at a nigga that done came from the squalor
Now my buddy so gone I can pop your collar
Now If I don’t say nothin, let me see you swallow
In my crib got the co-ed back the new problem
In the club feed them liquor of the wise I'm starving
So much green gettin twisted like Botanical Garden, let's go

On a Sunday night I might bring me some haze

[Intro]
Swisha House, Big Pokey and Paul Wall, baby

[Verse 1]
It's the People's Champ, I'm something like a baller
The candy paint dripping off of the old school Impala
I'm with that Big Bank Hank, that Poppa Joe and Box
Trunk bump like chicken pox, turn the bass up just a notch
You see them blades choppin', you see that trunk poppin'
Hoes that diss me in the club, the same hoes in the parking lot boppin'
They see me in the Jag, acting bad with T. Farris
Open mouth and showcase ice, and you gon' see about 20 karats
I'm with that Gu U on 5-9-double-O
In the Tahoe on 24's I'm the truth, I got that glow
I'm out that Swisha House with Archie Lee and Coota Bang
Sittin' sideways on swang, the candy paint dripping off the frame
You see me acting bad, I'm showing out and pulling stunts
Say ""cheese"" and show my fronts, it's more karats than Bugs Bunny's lunch
It's Paul Wall baby, I got it made
I got a cup full of that oil and I'm paid plus I'm...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
What it do, I'm on the block posted up like a mailbox
Slanging licks on the grind, putting money in my socks
A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals
A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills
I'm in the club posted up with some gangbangers
Still flipping the old school candy Cadillac on swangers
I got a styrofoam white cup full of that drank
Looking for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank
Big bank take little bank, 84's and candy paint
Tryna find some Honey Love, my macking game is top rank
These hoes peeping me, ear hustling on the side
Eavesdropping my conversation, tryna figure which car I drive
I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumping
Hit the corner you hear me bumping, look at that cold grill and woman
The trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped
I'm the undisputed king of the parking lot, I'm...

[Verse 3: Big Pokey]
Maybe O'Jays, hoes be going crazy when they see me
Sittin' sideways on them 24's, watch ya ho
Bunch of money, bunch of clothes, Cigarillos, Optimos
Glidin' like a ice skater, motor like a snot nose
Suicide drop doors, mono blocks, chop mold
Customized deck, cause the mono block stock lows
Sensei, Don 'Ke, Paul Wall in the place
Heads up when you see us, we gon' put it in ya face
Raised on Scott in the Yella
When I blaze, boys smell lemon haze, I ain't the nigga to settle
I'm that dude with the metal, that get hot as a kettle
From messing 'round with some cat that ain't got it together
Flossing, breaking off intersection, crossing
Three-wheelin' acting a iz-ass on them Bosses

Pull up in the driveway leanin' and I'm...

Well, you kinda heard me speaking
""You ain't a crisp like Snoop, you ain't a blood like Game""
And I was speaking on Game without knowing him
But now, you know a lot of these dudes jump in the game
And they rap artists and that's exactly what they is
But they not what they say they are when they rap it
[Incomprehensible]
Everybody wanna be the king of the south when
They ain't runnin' the damn thing with they mouth
No doubt, it's all good, y'all just stay in y'all opinions
But in the South and in the hood it's understood without saying
It's a given and it ain't 'cause what I'm doin' for a livin'
It's more because of what I'm doin' how I'm livin'
Not to mention when I'm rappin', I'm just hurtin' niggas feelings
And still chillin' on somethin' that's into healing
Man, permissions from the Click to continue to keep it pimpin'
But while the crack was in the house
The record sale went through the ceiling
So say what you want and do what you please
But for fun I shoot 22's from your shoes to your knees
I run a record label and a crew of G's
So niggas will come and look for you if you sneeze
Or even breathe the wrong way
You better do what the song say and be easy
Else it'll be a long day

I'm a king, you pussy niggas couldn't see me in your dreams

I'm a king, remember I can get your block knocked off
I'm a king, a Bentley coupe with the top chopped off
I'm a king, I'm connectin' nationwide but in the South
I'm a king, just respect it and keep my name out 'cha mouth
Everybody wanna be the King of the West
But, they ain't runnin' the damn thing in the West
That's to bad, it's all good, they just speakin' they minds
Stand on top of the Hollywood sign, you can see that it's mine
I'd rather die, motherfucker, than give up my throne
My crown is a Dodger fitted, California's my home
And it's known when the drama pop off, I bring the chrome
So nigga leave me alone, 'fore I start living my songs
I made a killin' drug dealin', some people say I'm a villain
Went from choppin' in the house, to the top of rap gettin' millions
So watch your mouth, unless you ready to bleed
'Cause to me, murderin' wack mc's is somethin' like a disease
Top down in the Impala, so I can ride in the breeze
And where I'm from, niggas throwin' up B's and C's
So make a turn the wrong way, think about what the song say

Riding through the hood, got me gripping the grain
And I'm sipping the same, while I'm changing the lane
Eyes real tight cause I'm choking the green
Vision messed up, cause I'm drinking the lean
Messing with a D-Boy, riding them big toys
Make your main gal wanna get on my team
She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel, but I know I'm a star
Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part and be buying the bar

When I want nothing less then the best of the trees

I'm so emotional! I love my Glock
Cash rules everything around me, so what's realer?
About the scrilla, call me a Ghostface Killa

Switched hustles, been killin' em ever since
It pays to tell the truth, dog, it only makes sense

Clear my mind from the shit I see
In a world full of smoke, contact from the weed
That's when it really dawned on me
That I'mma be here for life, ain't never gon' leave
The ghetto's all that I know
It's just another day in the hood my nigga
Layin back trying get this dough
Yellin out ohhh-ohhhh
All up in the club and you know how we roll
Squad deep like ohhh-ohhhh
Bad little bitches with they booty on swoll

Big-ass truck, brand new rims
Tanktop Yankee, tanned out Timbs
Bracelet, chain, fronts popped in
New tattoos, new black shoes

Gucci, Urbes, we do that too
Wanna feel the breeze get a new black Coupe
Nigga drop the top, come through the hood
Put a hundred on your three or your foul line shot
(Ohhh can you believe it?)
Linen outfits, all on the bus
Cause none of us can see a summer without trips
Mad hot so the little boys might bother you
But they all act good if the hood bother you

Basketball tournaments, pitbull pups
Ladies in the club pourin Crist' in cups
Niggas in the jail callin home on the phone (cause they ""Locked Up"")
But you still tryin to act like ain't shit rough
Mad cyphers in the park, mad fights in the park
Niggas talk how they run every night from the NARC's
Outside from the light to the dark, then the dark to the light
I wanna smoke but I could search for my life

[Akon]
Can you believe it? I done spent ten again
Wtching her bend again, dancin for many men
Tell me have ever thought of gettin in
In a room full of Konvicts and D-Block militants
They'll show you the time of your life
You can occupy my passenger side
Introduce you to the street life
Watch you fall in love after just one night
Ohhh-ohhhh
All up in the club and you know how we roll
Squad deep like ohhh-ohhhh
Bad little bitches with they booty on swoll

Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows
Reach the gate, hungry just ate
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight
This must mean she ain't tryna wait
Conversate, sex on the first date
I state, ""You know what you do to me""
She starts off, ""But I don't usually""
Then I whipped it out, rubber no doubt
Step out, show me what you all about
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse
Pull your G-string down South

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
You heard about the kid, you know how I rock
Went from pumpin bags on the block, straight to the top
So the money ain't a thing now, yeah that's right
Mansion after mansion, next stop the Hamptons
I splurge with it, I'm so absurd with it
Got the hunger to go get it, cause I wan' go spend it
You know how a boss player play, nigga I'm ballin
If there's money to be made, I'm all in
Catch me in a cherry red Porsche, beige seats, red pipin
You want me to teach you how to stunt, aight then
Tattoos on the arm, 30 karats on the charm
Cause the flow be the bomb, learn to respect the Don
First night if I don't hit, second night I want some shit
Third night we call it quits, I ain't fuckin with the bitch
Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life
Another move another mill', let's get right - aight?

Y'all into wifin, we don't condone lifin
Only fuck with bitches that, got they liquor license
Shop high prices, shook all vices
Infamous nigga got the game in a vice grip
Chain hundred K but the flow, is priceless
Anything less? We rollin them dices

My rings alone could pay for you to eat
For the next few years I'm so icy kid
My flow is long money, my face is Hollywood
My tattoos gon' keep me with a thug part though
My attitude is universal, get harmed - call money
When we get back to Queens we gon' hurt you
Can't afford to ride, you gettin stomped out

Ready to line you up and take you out
My girls is hot man, they hard to turn down

I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Verse 1]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team; I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: ""Dawg, in due time!""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg! You where I am!""
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven

I gotta testify

(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)

[Verse 2]
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm going on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm trying to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

[Hook 2]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Guess who's on third? Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz, but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street
I'm trying to stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm laying on the beat
En garde, or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like…

[Hook 2]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
The club was far from empty
It was crowded at the entry (Woo!)
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me (Uh-huh!)
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)
I could feel my body yearning
The room just started turning
Didn't want to go out on the floor
But this girl was so determined
My brain began to sizzle
I'm sweatin' just a little
On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggled
She said

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man

It's hard for me to control myself (Me too)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Verse 2: LL Cool J]
Temptation is a mother
How we lust for one another (Yeah)
We barely know each other
Yet we're wilding like we're lovers
The air is full of passion
The strobe lights are flashin'
The hustlers throw cashin'
The bartender keeps splashin'
Her moves were so erotic
Her gaze was so hypnotic
I begged this girl to stop it
But she continued to pop it

You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your Sidekick
Because the afterparty is at my body
Meet me you're invited

It's hard for me to control myself (Say what)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
She licked, off, her lip, gloss
Her hips, tossed, back, and forth
Side, to side, and up, and down
She touched, the ground, it turned, me out
I'm battling desire
Lord help me douse this fire
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo
Her top was short and purple
Belly dancing in a circle
When I feel like this I can't resist
Stop it don't make me hurt you (make me hurt you)

40-ounce in my lap freezing my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Coming pretty deep, me and my dogs
Yo, I gotta hit the back streets
Wondering about the six pounds and I got heat
Glock, Glock shots to the block, we creep-creep
Pop-pop, hope cops don't see me on the low key
With no regard for the law
We dodge 'em like: ""Fuck 'em all!""
But I won't get caught up and brought up
On charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car and a blunt to spark
Roll it up if you want, nigga, get it poppin', dog
Ready or not, we bust shots off in the air

They hoping that they gonna catch me ridin' dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
Now would you think it so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sho', ‘cause they think they know
That they catching me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me, trying to check my tags
Look in my rear view and they smiling
Thinking they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep trying
Steady denying that it's racial profiling
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags
Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
‘Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And being the baller that I am, I talk to them giving a
Damn about them not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin' dirty
Bet you'll be leaving with an even madder mood
I'ma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Yeah, my #2 on some old-school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, telling 'em: ""We hate you""
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they should've known
Tippin' down, I'm sittin' crooked on my chrome
Booking my phone, finding a chick I want to bone
Like they couldn't stop me

Damn, damn, ma, we ain't even have to go through it like that
It wasn't even, even that big, man
You know, nah, it's ight though
But anyway, yo, let me get that coat
Let me get those jeans, and let me get that rock on your finger
Oh, it's stuck? Then I'll take the whole finger than, man
And let me get those bags from Paris, and the puppies is staying, yo!

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Bouncin' around, when I'm up in these streets
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I should just bark on you, burn your car on you
Cuz I'm too much man, to leave a mark on you
You'se a bird, you know that, giving that man
Ten points, like he about to blow that
He probably did, you swallow his kids?
In and out of jail, he a snail, he wasn't wilding on bids
In the summertime, I broke his jaw, had to do it to him
Quick, old fashion, in the back of the mall
Me and him had 'mos forever, like I'm supposed to put him on
When he came home and told on Trevor
Had to bang on homey, ear blocks, out in spots
Throwing them shots, like 'nigga, you know me'
Stop fronting for them people outside like you really ride
And you a silly chick, thought you was really live
But I guess I was wrong, I'mma holla at dog
And rip his head off, words of a song

[Hook]

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I thought we was iller than that, all them kisses
And love yous, when jake came, you hid my packs
It was time a brother went to war, vests banged up
Staining in the kitchen, yo, holding a four
Sweatin' and breathing, bounced out of town for a weekend
Heard you had homey in the passenger seating
Honey, look, I'm a monster don, I do monster things
That's why I put your ass under my arm
Messing with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gonna hide in the streets when the body is gone
If it's one thing I learned that, never trust a female
On no scale, you just confirmed that
Bounce to your momma house, pack your shit
I don't care if you crying, you'se a ruthless chick
Gots to watch you, these eyeballs in my face'll spot you
My girl cousins, they gon' rock you

[Hook]

[Ne-Yo]
Shorty what is you thinking bout
Didn't I put you down
Flyest whips, rollin' round like yea
That's the bosses chick, on the side
I might of had, one or two
Them silly broads wasn't nothing on you
Rolling with him, try'nna get revenge
That shit, you just don't do

[Hook to fade]

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, you see, this for the knucklehead
Females out there that wanna be
Acting like they getting they little revenge off
Taking it further than what it really is
You know what I mean, playing yourself...
Nahwhatimean... this is Don status, girl
You will have to hold that now...
Word up, and when I see money
I'mma hang him upside down, it's on
And not because of you neither, you know
You don't even need that... it's real
Yeah... got my swagger back and all that
Theodore for life, yo, yeah
Get that tattoo off ya back and all that
Take that off, you ain't Theodore no more

But you don't be hearin it about your lover
You let it go in one ear and out the other
Now he say, she say, they say, I heard
If they fake we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be

See the lies just as obvious as cries for attention
Yield to the blindness, apply your suspicion
But listen, say you love me, gotta trust me
Why you stress this high school mess?
Break up never, they just jealous!
Drama from your momma, mean mug from your brothers

(Rah...Rah..Rah...Rah)

(Verse 2: Alicia Keys) (Baby Cham)
I remember those days when, we was dead broke
And, I could barely find a, dollar for a token
Hop in the train just to get where I'm goin
Po Po's after me I'm runnin like I'm smokin
Remember those days when I went to bed hungry
All I ever ate was white rice and honey
Big dreams in my head empty my tummy
Might crack a smile but ain't nothin funny
I remember playin over needles in the street
Everywhere I go and there was some part of mr
Thirteen thirteen was, hookers and hoes
On 11th avenue sellin bodies for dope (Whoa)
Remember cryin sayin that will never be me
Gonna make it someday gotta be somebody
Say, mommy don't worry it's just you and me
But, one day we will get out of this misery (Hey!)

(Chorus: Baby Cham)
We get di ting dem
Dem outta luck now
Mi squeeze seven and the whole a dem a duck now

I ride twenty-six and let my nine screens flip
Dro be watching Oprah, Mac 9 up in a clip
Triple black Phantom, nigga, nah, it ain't Tip
With Lucky Charms, diamonds, man, but nah, it ain't Flip
Can't bounce, okay, then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car talk, and I bet my motor clean
Suicide doors, brown Rover look like pork and beans
Everybody know me in the club cause they smoking me

(Hunting blood, blood-blood-blood) (x3)
Yo, Dre
Thought I was Dead
West Coast
(One blood) (x4)

[Verse 1: The Game]
I'm the Doctor's Advocate, nigga Dre shot ya
Brought me back from the dead, that's why they call him the doctor
The Math gon' drop him
And 50 ain't rocking with him no more
It's okay, I get it popping
Whole club rocking, like a '64 impala
Drink Cris, throw it up Call the shit hydraulics
Then piss in the cup, call the shit Hpnotiq
I bleed Compton, spit crack and shit chronic
And you new niggas ain't shit, but new niggas
Bathing Ape shoe niggas, I'm talking to you, niggas
Bouncing in the '64, throwing up West side, man
Sell another 5 million albums? Yes I am
Fresh like ""damn, this nigga did it again
A hundred thousand on his neck, L.A. above the brim""
Inside the Lambo, the shotgun with Snoop
What would the muthafuckin' West Coast be without one crip and

[Hook: Junior Reid]
One blood (x4)
Blood, blood, blood, blood-blood-blood (x3)
One blood (x4)

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm from the West side of the '64 Impala
Where niggas say ""Where you from?"" We ain't never say ""Holler""
Bandanna on the right side, gun on the left side
Niggas in New York know how to throw up the Westside
Word to Eazy
I'm so ill, believe me
I made room for Jeezy
But the rest of you niggas better be glad you breathing
All I need is one reason
I'm the king, and Dre said the West Coast need me
I don't know why you niggas keep trying me
Everybody knows I'm the heir to the Aftermath dynasty
And I ain't gotta make shit for the club
What DJ gonna turn down the thirty-eight snub?
You thirty-eight and you still rapping? Urgh
I'm 26 nigga, so is the dubs
On the '07 Hummer, hop out, no bodyguards
When the chronic smoke clear all you gon' see is -

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The Game]
I ain't got beef with 50, no beef with Jay
What's beef when you getting head in the six-tre?
And the double Game-Chain, I keep 'em on display
Black T-shirt, so all you see is the A
Turn on the TV, and all you see is the A
You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away
I don't regret what I spit, cause I know what I say
And niggas talking about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holding the Glock
No beam, no silencer - I know when to pop
Wait till Lil Jon come on and let off a shot
I have the number one billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers, and I climb right back to the top
I'm B.I.G, I'm Cube, I'm Nas, I'm Pac
This ain't shit but a warning till my album drop

Only thing that keeps me up, when I'm feeling down
I don't know about you, but I gotta keep mines around
'Cause I done looked, I done searched, and it's hard to find
Another shorty like mine, baby yes I'm
Addicted to how we kick it, everything you say to me
Never knew it could be so wicked, hoping that you stay with me
Search around the world but you will never find
Another shorty like mine, shorty like mine
I tell my niggas​ that uh you got a girl but she ain't nothing like mine
Cute face nice size like mine
Stay kitted, hood with like mine
Mean walk, talk the talk, let me tell you some more

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I knew that when I ran into this one
She would be the redrum of my pimpin'
Knew she would be the one to make me stop
Carin' about other girls on my jock and gettin' them
She was the one to slow me down, hold me down
I roll with her know
Go with it, now I'ma grow with it now
I'ma go get her, that's how I got her
Don't be mad you can't get one hotta
Broke the mould when they made lil momma
I don't care what my niggas​ say
She been there everyday for my drama
Some of the homies hate 'cause they want her
Wish they the ones that's datin' my woman
Gon' get a good look 'cause she fine
And I don't mind 'cause she mine

I'm a winner with the right prize
I'ma give it to her to the rhythm of a hi-hat
She got a beautiful mind you can't buy that
And the sight of her behind when she walk on by
Make a nigga wanna try that

Keep me from runnin' wild and I thank her
And we can talk about anythin' she got good conversation

Thank you, uh, uh
Snoop, Kells
You know how we get down

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I pull up, whip low in the Phantom with the wheels spinnin'
Ladies like ""That's that shit""
I'm in the back of the club, blowin' trees
Hands up, head bobbin' like that's that shit
In the spot where the girls go wild
Dancing titty bar style, I'm like ""That's that shit""
Snoop Dizzle (hey) your boy Kells (hey)
Let me hear you say ""That's that shit""

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Let's get this party jumpin', me and Kel' gon' get it bumpin'
They humpin' like when it's over, we gon' all get into somethin'
The Dogg is fresh, Southside without a vest
Nothin on my chest but these ladies up out the Midwest
I must confess that in the Chi you're so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago, let me get you to this real west
It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone
Get that home grown, put that shit on Daddy long
I know how you ladies do it, t-shirt with no panties on
Let's get this shit crackin', Kell and Doggy Dogg in action
If you in here all alone, you might get this dog bone

All these ladies on the floor cause they know what we in here for
Dogg and Kelly came to ball, get your ass up off the wall
Let that middle wiggle now make that shit fall
Not just one but all y'all, move it like you want it all
Let me see you bounce it for me, work that shit for Doggy Dogg
You gots to do it, is that your crew?
Bring 'em too, come here let me take you through it
Then once Kelly get into it, we can get this after party
Poppin' everybody, got themselves another body
Knockin' out without protection though, that's my confession
But at the spot if you just think you want a lesson, you can drop it like it's hot
Hold up, I came to cool out, lay back and get blown
Maybe Henny, maybe gin, a couple shots of Patron
And if you didn't you missed it but now it's known
That this that shit, Kels sing that song, come on

[Verse 1]
Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back {""Like this""}

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Verse 2]
Little Nicole is only ten years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions, she's makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she's about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and NEVER come back

[Hook] w/ ad libs

[Verse 3]
Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection, he's usin no glove
Never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she 'bout to run away and NEVER come back, ah!

[Verse 1]
I heard motherfuckers sayin' they made Hov
Made Hov say, ""Okay, so, make another Hov!""
Niggas wasn't playin' they day-role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it, but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends' business interests is Day Glow
Ain't nothin' left to say though
I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch, but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man
It's stronger than heroin
When you could look in the mirror, like, ""There I am""
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one

Lose one, let go to get one
Get one, lose some to win some
You lost one
Story of a champion
Sorry, I'm a champion
You lost one

[Verse 2]
I don't think it's meant to be, be
But she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, we ain't we, it's me and her
'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her free time, even if it hurts
So, breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this earth
To be all you can be, like the reserves
And me? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she her time to serve
The time's now for her, in time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now it ain't fair, so yeah, she lost one

[Hook:  Chrisette Michele & Jay-Z]
Lose one, let go to get one
Get one, lose some to win some
Oh yeah, you lost one
Story of a champion
Sorry I'm a champion
You lost on

[Verse 3]
My nephew died in the car I bought
So I'm under the belief it's partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
Place any burden on me, but please, not that, Lord
But time don't go back, it goes forward
Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
'Til that time, little man, I'm nauseous
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the Lord's gift
Almost lost my faith, that restored it
It's like havin' your life restarted
Can't wait for your child's life, to be a part of it
So now I'm child-like, waitin' for a gift
To return, when I lost you, I lost it

[Hook: Chrisette Michele & Jay Z]
Lose one, let go to get one
Get one, lose some to win some
You lost one

The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Come through, something ill, missing the ceilin'

Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why's that?
‘Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap
‘Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not taking it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together, all together now

Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscing when it wasn't all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip-hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka
RIP, we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3's
From ""Beat Street""to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm looking over my shoulder
It's about 80 people from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut

Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cot
Picture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx

Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she wouldn't get far cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that far, how you get that far
And all these new video bitches tryin to be Melyssa Ford
But they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha

You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed

Game you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these
Bitches knowin' damn well they gon' call me
The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team
Head so good he don't ask for a pre... nup
Now ask yourself this question, umm
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo
Well why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me fo'
But since they all fall in my Palm, I take a trio, yo

[Hook: The Game]
You wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time
But you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

[Verse 3: The Game]
I done had my share of bitches with long hair
Short do like Kelis or Halle in Boomerang, yeah
I been around the block in the Bentley drop top
In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case
She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes
And ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyonce from Jay
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day
The things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face
Stabbed Un in the stomach
She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman, on that superhero shit
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'
Impala, forget the double D's
I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Toccara
And she ain't win the show but she ridin' in that Gallardo
That's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow

[Hook: The Game]
You wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
You wouldn't get far, if you kept your legs closed
It would be just a waste of time
But you know, you wouldn't get far, fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all

[Outro - The Game]
God damn, you know what I'm sayin'
I'm sittin' back watchin' Kanye video
And I see the same bitch that was in the homeboy Busta Rhymes video
Then I flip the muh'fuckin channel
Checkin' out my uncle Snoop Dogg video
And I see the same bitch, that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'
And then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up
I'm watchin Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina
I see the same bitch on Oprah, floatin away on the hood of a Camry
That was in the nigga Lil Weezy video
I mean damn, everywhere I look
Everywhere I go, I see the same hoes
Don't get mad, I'm only bein' real, yeah

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a

[Hook: R. Kelly]
I'm a flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club, I'm a flirt
Winking eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs, I'm a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low, I'm a flirt
And when she's with her man looking at me damn right, I'm a flirt
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cuz, I'm a flirt
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cuz, I'm a flirt
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me because, I'm a flirt

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to, shining like I supposed to
In the club fucking with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas trying to holler at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, nigga I'm gon' holler at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I would probably fuck with all of y'all
Yeah, yeah homie you say she your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'mma be like cousin
Believe me man this is how them playas do it in the Chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of this story is cuff your bitch
Cuz hey, I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and I'm a flirt

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Hey homie if you ain't got no money
You better keep her away from me, ya dig?...

Well if ya love ya girl and wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin' up and askin' me to meet ya girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to ya girl
She winked her eyes on the sly, I seen cha girl
Better treat girl right cause another man will
Better eat ya girl like another man will
Cause you leave ya wife and I see ya wife now be for real
How long ya think that's fixin' to be ya wife
Well I'm livin' the life, you just gettin' it right
Ya old lady look at me cuz you ain't hittin' it right
She probably used to like you cause you the business type
That's 'til I came along and put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass lookin' thick in the light
I noticed she was checkin' me and diggin' the ice
And if I get that tonight bet I hit that twice
I can even make her mine if I hit that right
You know, smack that thang
Sit that right up on that dress, see yeah that's right
Pullin' on her hair like we gettin' in a fight
Yeah, I know it's kind of tight but it'll sweat just right
So if ya girl sexy and she test me
Don't be upset G cause you might catch me
Tryin' to catch a glance up her skirt, the McLaren in reverse
If I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
When I, when I, when I...

When I pull up to club all the shorties be like, ""Damn twenty-eights""
Then I be like ""girl you know just who I am, don't hate""
See I done +Fell in Love with a Stripper+ y'all
All I do is flirt with her and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pat
Teddy Pain was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'mma flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me Teddy Bend-Er-Ass-Down
I be like ""Como se llama, lil' mama? Me llamo Pain
What is your name? I'm feeling your vibe and I'm hoping you feel the same""
I'mma wink my eye and let you know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what you say
""He's so fly, yes he's so cool""
Hey shorty, hey shorty what it do
He mad cuz I'm looking but I already fucked her
I got these niggas mad cuz I'm a flirt

Now if you walk in up in the club with a bad chick
And if she lookin' at me then I'm gon' hit
Manjackin' for chicks, I tried to quit it
But I'm a playa homie so I had to hit it
While you buying her drinks in the club, actin' like you in love
Stuntin' like you all thug, we was switching numbers
She looking at you and I walk by, you turn your head, she wink her eye

She be calling you Kelly when your name is Tommy
I don't know what y'all be thinking when you bring 'em around me
Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B
Do you know what that means? That means if you love your chick
Don't bring her to the V.I.P cause I might leave with your chick

I'm in that mean, green machine; clean, on 19s
Flatscreens in the headrest, swingin' like a swingset
Brandywine paint wet, comin' down, that's a bet
I'm in the lot chasin' broads like a lesbian
Full of that kush-flower, I'm breakin' off pedestrians
Higher than a streetlight, floatin' like a parachute
Buzzin' like a bumblebee, mustard-green Bentley coupe
Young gangsta mack game sharper than a thumbtack
Breakin' 'em off, makin' all the boppers attract
Then they watch me, I'm rocked up, fully loaded and sloppy
Tryna hit it and quit it and walk off like Big Papi
Break 'em off

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil' Keke]
Aye, aye
I pull up like this, untouchable white wrist
I'm hotter than warm piss, berry grape Sunkist
The truck gold mist 550 snow bunny
Bentley Continental with the mink floors dummy
Paul Wall money, that's expensive taste
And them friendly ass fools we send 'em to MySpace
I'mma break 'em off until the backbone broken
Stainless steel drop Phantom, leave the top open
Shit done hit the fan, better cover your nose
And the kush done start burnin', better cover your clothes
(that's right)
Concrete crumblin', glass shootin' lasers
Crawlin' and cuttin' up on 24 razors
I'mma show 'em how to make the slab look phenomenal
Chasin' paper in the mornin', call me Houston Chronicle
Hold on, then you buckle up the seat belt
SwishaHouse, Young Don, capital TF

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Already
I'm higher than a satellite, crawlin' like a baby
Maneuvering through the traffic like I'm Tracy McGrady
Still choppin' on them buttons, I'm struttin' and lookin' fresh
Switch hittin' like Berkman, this is ballin' at its best
In that Minute Maid dropper with retractable roof
Finer than wood, wavin' the hood, student loans on the tooth
The fifth wheel on the ground
And the trunk in the air
Paul Wall, baby I'm the definition of playa
My skills is so ill when workin' that wood wheel
Tippin' 4s like a waiter, beware of the oil spill
Widescreen mindframe, panoramic pimpin'
I'm sippin' on that Osama, baby, leanin' like I'm limpin'
In that two-seater feeder, it's me and a señorita
Three ounces up in the liter
And it's ten up in the heater
Mackin' a mamacita
Runnin' game like a cheetah
I'm knockin' 'em out the park similar to Derek Jeter
Break 'em off

Paparazzi spots me
In the lobby of my high-rise
I hide behind my shades
Cause the fame is blinding my eyes
My god
I know how Ozzie Oz
Once had felt when he was as high
As I have got
I have got
To make this stop
People often warn me
That the fame ain't for the faint of heart
It'll change those
Who said they had love for you
Into strangers
When your fame starts
It's a chain reaction
Locomotion like when the train departs
Stranger
Things have happened
Rapping
Stacking
Platinum plaquin'
Born in Brooklyn got a place in Manhattan
Going back to Brooklyn
To escape the madness
When your friends is
Chris and Gwyneth
When your girl is more famous
Then you then it's
Time to get all your windows tinted
Keep your eyes squinted
It's gonna flash any minute
The music biz is like musical chairs
It's about where you standing when the music stop spinning

Oooooh, Damn!
I mean I just keep thinkin about you (awww baby)
I mean I wanna move on but I can't move on (oh, oh, oh, ooooh)
It's like you got some kind of hold on me
And I don't know
But I'm a go ahead and talk about it
Listen

[Verse: 1 Bow Wow]
I'm sittin lookin out the window like damn
Tryna fix this situation that's at hand
You still runnin through my mind - when I'm knowin that you shouldn't be
Me all on ya mind, I'm knowin that it couldn't be
Cause you ain't called, and I ain't even apalled
I still got alot of pain, I ain't dealt with it all
I been runnin 'round with other chicks - I'm single and they lovin it
I'm likin it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it - I'm tryna let you go
I can't get a grip of it, is what I'm tryna let you know
You gotta hold of some kinda control on me
I don't know what it is - but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm workin at it and it ain't gettin no better
Just tryna be like ""yeah, forget it, whatever""
Instead of starrin out this glass - lookin at this bad weather
Damn I gotta pull myself together, cause...

[Hook - T-Pain]
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick, out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Verse 2 - Bow Wow]
I'm too attached my heart want let me fall back
I got it bad that's what you can call that (ah)
And when I see you in the streets that's the worse for me
Use to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doin?, where you at?, or can I see you later?
The fellas tellin'me just let her go Bow
Believe me I'm tryin man I just don't know how
I be in all the hot spots - leavin with the hot shots
Knowin they just want me cause I'm the top spot
That's not poppin, and my brain ain't stoppin
Thinkin who she with?, or where she goin?, is she club hoppin?
I never had this kinda problem in my life
This is my first time dealin with this kind of fight
It's every night, and every flight, and everytime you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right....cause

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Hook: Bow Wow]
Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been runnin thru my mind all day - can you feel me
I been tryna get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me

I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole life planned out together

And correct all my mistakes that I ever did

Has been disconnected cause the sucker ain't balling

So get my lawyer on the line, I'll be doing some time
They're trying to bring me down, tell em they can keep trying

Walk by the dance floor winking at the women
Gang of bitches sagging my pants

You almost grabbed the magnum P-I

Do different shit my money, I buy horses
Invest in a couple resorts and a couple golf courses

Man, I've tried so hard
But will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away, but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hoping one day you will come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up

And I come from the dark side
So I'm having a hard time staying on track, man

Been in and out of relationships
I'm starting to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back, prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right, but really I'm wrong
And again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane, chasing my dreams
And then it seems like when the fame and cash came
It just got me going crazy, lately
I've been so faded, trying to erase it
But I just can't, ‘cause the drama just grows greater

That say they love me the most
How could I create the distance
When it's supposed to be close?
And uh, I just don't know, but I be out here fighting demons
And it's like a curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland
And Lord, would you help me?
And stop this pain I keep inficting on my family?
Hustlin' and gamblin', trickin' and scramblin'
And losing sight of what I'm supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage, ‘cause everyday's a challenge
And man I'm slippin'

So used to this hustling money
That I don't understand no 9-to-5 work
Studied on the streets, hustlas know what I mean
Hustlas ballin' before us
I'm trying to make it to that major league
So we will never leave until the sun came up
Gotta get it, no, nope, not leaving no budge
Today games they play
Gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you (on you)
Gotta watch what you sign to
Try so hard, but I won't pull through

When the beat drop dip and make your booty roll
Cold peace of work filling out your mini skirt

You sick of lame dudes frontin' wit' an attitude
Talkin bout their rims and all they damn tennis shoes

You used to sushi, vino and some calamari
You want a nigga that might grow up to be somebody
O.T resorts by the sea sand between toes
Umbrella in ya' drinks

Take a bubble bath get the robe out the closet
And wait for me don't think I'm afraid to toss it
You hate for me to stand up cause it makes you nauseous
It's late but can't go to sleep cause your pussy gorgeous

So many apple bottom freaks showin' belly

A look in her eyes smile on her lips

Y'all know what this is

When I'm on that beat, I'm a beast, I ain't never came weak
Got a mouth full of diamonds you can hardly hear me speak
Specially when it sound like this, this
It's the H-Town baby and you know what it is
I'm throwed
Got a styrofoam cup full o' barre
I'm throwed
Four deep in my old school car
I'm throwed
Chokin' Cali while I'm bangin' the Screw
It's the Ice Man baby and you know what it do

Fresher than a fruit bowl
Leanin' like a gas gauge
Straight up off the dome
Freestylin' like hair braids
Makin' that candy dance
I'm throwed off the Cali plants
I'm prancin' on the scene crawlin' down like fire ants
My mind in a trance
I'm sharper than starched pants
Stackin' Franklins and Grants from South Bank to Spring Branch
I'm posted like a stamp with my mind on cash
I'm wheel grippin' and still tippin' brandy wine on glass
I got a screen in the dash
A quarter-tank full of gas
Smokin' that puff puff pass
Throwed I hope I don't crash
Reppin' that Swisha Blast, so I'm flyer than a mockin' bird
Throwed in the mode, game cold as a iceberg, baby

Now with the broads, I'm a sharp shooter like Steve Kerr
Flash the wrist, cause a glare, fox fur, and flyin' spur
Undisputed for sure, so I'm collectin' these dimes
Name and number lil mama cus it's check out time
I'm slidin' on glass threes inhalin' the chronic trees
Pack protection cus playa hatin' spread like STDs
I'm cool as an ocean breeze
Like Chester I'm chasing cheese
I'm stangin' like buzzin' bees
On South Lee with the G's
Screens fall like autumn leaves
Make the TVs rain
Take a picture if you please
Yeah, my wrist is the same
30 carat diamond chain so ballin' is off the chain
Mind frame: I'm stackin' change
I'm so throwed in the game

I'm on the grind stackin' up my mail like the post office
Movin' at slow pace with T-Ferris my ace
Cup full of expensive taste
Open mouth and showcase
I'm throwed with screens hangin' swangin' breakin' the struts
We pourin' up in them cups that stuff got me leanin' tough
Hold up
I'm caked up so all the boppers attract
I got 'em like a soccer mile out there runnin' the track
Pullin' capers makin' paper stacks fly as a dove

Cause I'm a d-boy, and she's a go getter
Uhh, this new girl that I'm provin on
Got a young boy thinkin 'bout movin on
She got her Louis Vuitton bag and her shoes on
Wanna take her to the telly bust a move dawg

Every time I slip up she behind me, gon' be right there to remind me

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Can I get a little bit a L-O-V-E?
Can ya spend a little bit of dough on me?
Can I get a little bit a ya T-I-M-E
Boy if ya wanna make it
Could ya gotta give a little bit a love

[J.D.]
Uh yea, haha, just a lil bit, Layzie! give her a lil bit

[Layzie Bone]
Can we take a long walk on the beach, get away from the streets
Baby girl, me and you need to rendezvous
Cancun next week, how that sound to you?
I've been meaning to spend a little time witchu
I can tell you fed up from all of the promises I've been making lately
And I had to deliver but I been so caught in my hustle, tryna make this payment
And I shoulda considered your feelings
I shoulda been better about it
I shoulda been grown, not childish
I shoulda been way more polished
But my hustle done paid off, and I'm ready to spoil you..love
Come look, what cha boy gon do? (gone do), let me make this up to you (to you)

[Chorus]

[J.D.]
Uh, uh, Bow Wow! give her a lil bit

[Bow Wow]
Weezy girl, I can't believe what you sayin'
You know you got it, should meet with my fans
But every time I get a break I'm layin
Where? in your arms all night and day playin'
You won't some time, I send you jacob, want sunshine then take a vacation
We ain't gon make it if you keep complainin, everybody go through changes
Love is a dangerous (thing)
(why?) it's full of happy and sad faces
Break it up to make up later, talk it out so it ain't no anger
We need more communication, you should have some consideration
Cause you knew from the day we met
What, what type of player you was dealing wit. haha

[Chorus]

[J.D.]
Uh huh, uh huh, wish! give her a lil bit

[Wish Bone]
Everything I do, just for me and you, stack a little paper so its never rainy days
I got you, but just for me then you got to, understand that I hustle, hustle
Diamonds things, I gotta hustle, hustle, anything that brings the weight up
See a real thug too its in his nature, its in his nature
Not tryna say that you about that paper, but me and you, yes we like that paper
Overseas trips, diamonds on the wrists, you must admit, your boy gets that paper
I like bossin, girl, girl, but you beside me, slide wit me, slide wit me
Try and take it away thats when I ride and ride

Dreads hangin long down in Memphis on my grizzly
Gone for a second, now I'm back did you miss me?
You can find me ""In Da Club"" but my name ain't 50
Kinfolk Kia Shine, look it's not a game with me
Been broke kinfolk, now I pop Cris-sy
You would do the same thang, if you knew my history
Haters see my champagne, now they wanna get me
The same dude they call Dusty, in V.I.P. krispy
Well my ice game right mayne, it got yo' wife choosy

Respect my grind, shit I be e'rywhurr
I'm through buyin bapes cause I got e'ry purr
I ain't a trapper rapper, still a G from the hood
That Great China Wall, I spent a G on the hood
I got them year-up windows that come in the bucket
A house note on yo' jeans Shine? I don't care nigga, fuck it

Check your dictionary I'm the fly definition
And my stones so clear they in high definition (BLING!)
Took twenty stacks, got a track from Play-N-Skillz

Ol' Sylvia cut the check now it's time for me to rock out
And my release gon' be bigger than the day they let 'Pac out

I stay outta town but I'm so true to Memphis
A head hearty chop with the new true religion
Chain on my wallet and my shoes is ridiculous
Whoever did your wardrobe, you dudes look ridiculous
Polo player, D.V.'s, Zoo addict
LaCroix don't make it if your boy ain't got it
Tennis shoe fanatic, I'm the traffic jam rocker
Closet full of shoes you cain't find at Footlocker
Let me talk about where I live cause you know why dreads fly
Slats in my crib like I stay in Best Buy
I can flip stlyes like I flip hot cars
Look how I flipped from prep to rapper to rockstar

I'm a real nigga homie, throw six figures on me
Got a pistol you don't want it, boy you what what it is

The wait is over, here we go again, I'm back into play
Gon' sell another couple mil' and take it back to the A
Gon' take that other couple mil' and put it back in the safe
Five cash for the crib on the back of the lake
I'm up in Crucial two-steppin with the gat in the waist
T.I. ain't in the street no mo', fo'-fo', is that what they say?
Don't even try him when you see him boy you have to be great
Cause this pistol hit you in your face, your teeth they'll have to replace
That's if you lucky nigga trust me, it don't hurt me to take
100 thousand to them Haitians you'll be murdered today, nigga

Well they sweatin when they see me, I'm apparently hot
Had the album of the year nigga, Grammy or not
Remember, all day I used to stay in the spot
With two revolvers in my pocket, pitch a hand of that rock
And now, chart toppin, ain't a car I ain't got
I'm the number one customer at my own car lot
You wanna know how much I'm makin, just imagine a lot
You know I'm probably gettin more that you'd imagined I got
Listen close, I need to know if you understand me or not
Because you disrespectin me, you and your man'll be shot

Why y'all take shot, cause I'm movin?
We'll pop you in your chest boy

[Verse Three: T.I.]

Ridin in a car you probably never seen in the states
No idea how much yay I can bring in the states
Hey you can get a hundred on 'em for a million today
Frank Lucas ain't the only one who made a million a day
But it's a American gangsta right here in your face
And you don't wanna see P$C on the scene with a K
You think you runnin up and robbin, that ain't even the case
And just because you get away, that don't mean it's okay
You a dead man walkin and I mean it, okay? Hey

And got an entourage and her own paparazzi

Pop it, boy, you better run for cover {*thunder*}

And we standin on the couch
With my drink and my two step my drink and my two step
Three glasses in a row you start to think I was Q-Tip
Bartender pour a round I took a few sips
Stumblin', fallin' down, I ain't drunk that's my new step
Now why would I listen to bullshit they shovel
When they taste level ain't at my waist level
I'm fly get on a plane jet lagged already
I'm tired, the Goyard bags is heavy
I'm fire, the flow hard as a Chevy
I told her me like ye, she said she like me, ha
When see me with a CL like Pete Rock
She just wanna grab a microphone and beat box
Even in high school I was always a special kid
First pack of condoms I asked for extra big
Now I got a flow they sit me right next to Big
And all these old rappers don't know where the exit is
But but but no buts nigga
What nigga
We fired motherfuckers, Donald Trump nigga
I'm killin' these niggas can't front nigga
Now let's drink to that until drunk nigga

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
I got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
Got my drink and my two step
My drink and my two step
It's on, it's on, it's on and I'm home
Get the patron and tell them that it's on
All the bottle poppin
Patron we rockin
All the bottle poppin
Patron we rockin
Err everybody drunk
Err everybody drunk
And I'm home get the patron and tell them that it's on

[Verse 2: Cassidy]
It's remix time
We rich time
Shine like sequence time cause he did time
But then he came home grabbin' the mics and bought rap back to life yea he that nice
I'm rocky like a package of white
You see that ice
Nigga please you never seen canaries that bright
I shine I make it look like day time at night
I could never turn the lights off until I take my ice off
Yellow and white chain yellow and white cross
I been a boss ever since I took my diapers off
I like to floss I can get you and ya wife divorced
Ya'll separate before I take her on a second date
You can speculate who comin' in second place
Cause I got the number one record out check it out
I got my drink n my 2 step
It's on now
November 6 is the day that it's goin' down

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ne-Yo]
So many shots that I can't see straight
All these women around me cats still sayin he can't be straight
Give me ya girl and some platinum Patron
When she come home you can ask her is me straight
She might smile a lot but she won't speak much
Yawnin' cause last night she ain't sleep much
She won't even talk about what we did
Just smile close her eyes and say yes he is
I'm on my Rick James and it's a celebration
I got a driver so I ain’t drinking in moderation
Neither are you little mama and here's another
Celebrate the return of the hustla

[Hook]

[Outro: Cassidy]
Yeah I go by the name of Buzz
My album be in stores November the 6
It's celebration time
Ne-Yo, Kanye, Swizz Beats, I appreciate y'all comin through doin' what y'all do

For real for real

I try to play cool
Actin like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin at home, all alone
Tryin to keep myself from goin crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about {T-Pain}
I want my baby back! {'Lo-so} And I thought it would be easy
But it's hard for me to let you GO~!
(Baby don't) GO! (Baby don't) go!
(Baby don't) go (baby don't) {y'all know what this is}

[Fabolous]
Now I'm better than your ex, gon' be better than your next
Baby Screwed Up so you better be from Tex-as
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out
Nothin to scream about just back your Beemer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to key my house
Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?
Better do you cause I damn sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me
The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me
I don't wanna another you so I'mma slide (yup)
But I got another boo, on the side, bay-bay

[Hook: T-Pain (Fabolous) {unlisted J.D. ad libs}]

[Fabolous]
Through the time I been alone, time I spent on phones
Know you ain't lettin them climb up in my throne
Now, baby that lime with that Patron
Have me talkin crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above
It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick wit'cha entree and get over your side
We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love'll have you open though
I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show
So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man

[Hook]

[Fabolous]
Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The next rap to show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'mma do somethin, it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us
Mr. and Ms. Smith, we both got the burners - UP~!
If you love your baby then turn this up
Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup
Relax, don't be tryin to perm us up
We already straight - yesss

[Hook]

[Jermaine Dupri]
Fab we gon' have to make a dance to this song man!
Y'knahmean; ain't no WAY you can't dance on this
Uhhh, T-Pain!

But it's hard for me to let you GO~!

I'm so HOOD! Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist

If you get closer to my house then you know what I'm talking bout
I'm out the HOOD! And if you feel me put your hands up
HOO-OOD! My hood niggas can you stand up
I'm so HOOD! If you not from here you can walk it out
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin bout

Walk around there's goddamn money on me
Pockets so fat it don't make no sense
Whips so clean don't need no tints
Watch so bright don't need no light
You know where it were don't need no mic
Niggas like Young what you get for your show
Tell 'em same thing I used to get for the blow
Set em on the raw nigga what I got to lose
Put 'em in the Vans - I ain't talking bout the shoes
Do the speed limit watch out for the lights
Pussy ass niggas gotta watch out for the dykes

And when we do it bad, but I'm doing good - I'm so, I'm so, I'm so motherfuckin' (HOOD)

In my hood - LUDA...
Everybody come equipped with bangers(BLAOW)
Throwin' up our middle fangers (what)
And you know I don't slip so I gotta keep ten in the clip and one in the chamber
Better be walking with angels and never take candy from strangers (okay)
Through the stress and strife, had to earn my stripes like I played with the Bengals (WHOOO) {HOOD}
I'm in the zone homes, goin' for the two-point conversion (oh)
I'm so hood that Ludacris shoulda been on the original version (yup)
But this is the remix, with the cheap tricks, hittin sweet licks
And I cut the braids off but the waves and the fade'll make you sea-sick (OHHH)
See this is the way that we ball (hey), and this is the way that we brawl
So put a fist in the air if you care that united we stand and divided we fall

Cause we on that hood shit I'm hood rich, comin' around your hood bitch, I swear I'm so...

See all I know is how to go and get my money g-gain and again
Top down let the money blow in the wind
With a bad bitch sitting in the passenger seat
With a doobie-wrapped head full of bobbie pins
You know I keep that thing when I walk
See the dialect different from the slang in my talk
Baby still leaving got a crackhead fronting got another bad bitch that'll boost for the spark (HOOD)
I'm used to leaving the strip last
Hustlin' until the sun comes up getting cash
So much bread in all of my four pockets
It look like a nigga got hips with an ass
And from the DNA in my blood niggas idolize me and try to do what I does
And if that other nigga ain't really from the hood you can easily die take who that fake nigga was (HOOD)
And even though I spit a little rap
Got niggas in the hood try to sell the most crack
Violator I send a nigga to do it just to make you spend a lot of money
Just to get your shit back
Y'all niggas know where I'm from and I rep it to the fullest til the day that I'm done
So hood where we live if a nigga sold drugs and he rich momma still proud of her son (HOOD)

Daddy Fat Sacks so hood like a Cadillac ornament on from the Baby-lon
Call an ambulance to come and pick that ass up cause the nigga never had the chance
They try, to dance with the devil in a pale moonlight,
Advance on a level that they can't do right
Lay hands on a fella like a man in blue lights - (WHOOP, WHOOP) do it twice
Your boy the B-I-G
I'm nicer than MC on your top three
You cocky, I cock, squeeze
Bust them things now you sloppy
Speed it up, slow it down then screw it,

Ay, this is the good life (Welcome to the good life)
Homey tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood (Welcome to the good life)
Like I'm new in the hood
The only thing I wish, I wish a nigga would (Welcome to the good life!)
He probably think he could
But, but, I don't think he should (Welcome to the good life)
50 told me, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up
The good life

[Hook: Kanye West & T-Pain]
Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I gots to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
I, go, go for mine, I gots to shine
(Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
I'ma get on the TV momma, I'ma
I'ma put shit down
(Ayy) ayyy (ayy) ayyy
(Ayy) ayyy (ayy) I'm good

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin some brain
Whipped it out, she said ""I never seen Snakes on a Plane""
Whether you broke or rich you gotta get this
Havin' money's not everything, not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas
Cause (the good life) I always had a passion for flashin'
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life

[Outro: T-Pain]
Better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmomma
Ain't the only girl callin me ""baby""
If you feelin me now
Then put yo' hands up in the sky, and let me hear you say
Heyy, heyy, ooooh I'm GOOD!

Stash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze

Ain't nathin' in the world
Like some thick, and some juicy
She going downtown, cause her favorite DJ's spinnin'
I'm all up in the door, so I'm already winnin'
I got a lot of women, but I'm way too choosey
And then I love my cake, like that Ricky love Lucy
On some peanut butter leather, with the wood so grainy
It must be raining dollars, cause she lookin' so gravy
Sophisticasted lady, pop it to the end, what it do
What the busi', baby girl, tell me what's happenin', what's happenin'

[Chorus: Baby Bash and Sean Kingston]
What is it

Everybody watch it

Watching me perform
Got the Cyclone ringtone on the phone

Swizzie! (Ghost!)
Yeah, smoke, now
S.P. c'mon, S.P. c'mon
Ghost - it's showtime, it's showtime!
Ghost - lighters in the air!

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
I wanna roll somethin up so
I-I can just blow, my mind (lighters in the air!)
I wanna, blow my mind (hey, hey - lighters in the air!)
Blow my mind (hey, hey, lighters in the air!)
You should roll somethin up so
You can just um, blow, your mind (blow your mind!)
You should just blow your mind (hey, hey, lighters in the air!)
Blow your mind (hey, hey, lighters in the air!)

[Styles P]
Mind blown and I'm tore down
Still blow an ounce and a half, even more now
Yeah, put your lighters in the air, light it up in here
Yeah, put it in the air, see if I'mma fuckin' care
You should find that I came to blow my mind out
Pass it and you drop it I'mma put you on time-out
Like Joe Frazier I'm smokin, mere bang out in the open
In the tub, but it feel like the ocean
I swear to God it be floatin
And I don't need a car to be coastin, you could say that I'm boastin
But this is S.P., and I know my time
When I hear showtime, I'mma blow my mind!

[Hook]

[Styles P]
The black hippie, the sack wit me, the lighter too
I have dreams of Amsterdam every night or two (Amsterdam)
I feel good, the sky couldn't be a brighter blue
Sun lookin like a tangerine
You got green and it's mean, brother hit me like a tambourine
I need a minute to myself, second to myself
Pass the dutchie on the left, whoever's suckin on the L
I'mma need candy cause I know my breath is gon' smell
I don't get sleep but some good restin off a L
Mind blown, time fly, time gone
Missed my exit on the highway I ride on
Roll another one, get in my good time zone

[Hook]

[Styles P]
I'm gone, the 'gnac and the wine gone
Eyes look stoned shit, but what, I'm grown
Over 21, come over to my zone
In less than two hours see a 50 box blown
Lovin the smell, feelin the texture
And we got a whole lot but we still gettin extra
Guess what's on the menu for breakfast
Roll with the Ghost if you wanna get messed up

[Hook]

[Outro: Styles P]
I mean just get blown away
Y'know... do what you do
Bungie jump or somethin, speed in the car
Do whatever blows your mind away
I know what blows mine away

[Hook: Amerie]
Now you done been around the world
And you'd seen a lot of girls
But you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like
Now you done rolled through some hoods
There's some girls that look good
But you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like
And you partied, and have hugs
And some girls show you love
But, you ain't never seen a girl look so fly like me
Baby, but you never had a girl look so fly like me

[Verse 1: Chingy]
Now I'd done been around the world, thought I'd seen it all
Err' color, err' shape, what I need and all
Switch like seasons, when the summers, spring and fall
And back seat of my jeep, I'm chrome veet and all
On the hunt for these girls were like my day to day
I get 'em alone, I jump 'em and then fade away
I give it good so some of them won't stay away
They try to lock me up, but I break away
And to the day i lay my eyes on the princess
And you can tell she was a dime from a distance
It took a minute to come to my senses
She's the perfect match and God is my witness
Now for the first time I've opened my eyes
Put the glass in the air, now I toast to the sky
Feels like I'm in heaven, and I'm hoping to fly
Baby girl, come along for the ride, you know why cause I...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chingy]
Now I ain't never had a girl that was so fly
Other guys come around, you acting so shy
You got 'em shaking in their boots, and I know why
Cause they can't handle the truth and that's no lie
As for me, I'm the one that you been dreaming on
And when you saw me, I'm the one that you were steaming on
And when you need it, I'm the shoulder that you would be leaning on
Take off that Gucci and keep them Vicky sneakers on
Let's take a flight 'cause the world is our playground
And buy houses from the Lou, to the A-Town
It's silk sheets so it's soft when you lay down
Ching-a-ling, yeah, I get down and stay down
There's no one better, baby girl, you's a blessing
You got me heading in a positive direction
You got my vote, when you re-up for election
Cause all I wanna do is give you love and affection

[Hook]

[Bridge: Amerie/Chingy]
Why you wasting your time (say what?)
And boy, running the streets (say what?)
When you can just come to me? (oh, is that right?)
You know i got what you need (say what?)
I got what you want (say what?)
Boy, won't you come and see? (all there, babe!)
What if you never seen a girl like me ever, like me before?
Won't you come inside, let me keep it dry
Cause I'm so fly

Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, uh, a fresh cool young Lu
Trying to catch his microphone, check 2-1-2
Wanna believe my own hype but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung you?
Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You, the more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, you come too
And then it hit me, standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me, I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung ""Blue""
Go back, whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me, two tons too
Ha ha ha ha-ha-ha

If you are what you say you are a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know, oh oh oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down to the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid
Then out through China, nearly miss the airliners
Magnified times five, unless it's pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze
Now that's important to say
Cause even with all that most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair and put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gonna clap and they ain't gonna praise
They want everything back that they've paid
Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha ha ha ha-ha-ha

If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show, oh oh oh, yeah

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
Cause I've been standing in this line for like five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along
And when I got to the front, they told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say ""You need to go and see that""
And everybody claps cause everybody is pleased
And then they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, ""Ha ha ha-ha-ha
Ha ha ha-ha-ha, ha""

She wants that old thing back
She want those Heroin tracks

She fiends for me nightly
She leans for me
Morning, she rush for my touch
This is about lust

My presence is a must- must- must-

If I didn't when we cutting, the feeling would be too strong
In any form, I'm giving you sweet dreams

I am so dope
Like Louboutins with the red bottoms
You gotta have 'em, you glad you got 'em
Like every color Giuseppe's, your guilty pleasure is me
It's so much fun, you shun therapy
Although it never be, the feeling is fleeting
Shopping's like coppin', you constantly need it
I'm never around, you constantly seek it
You'll never be down, I know where your peak is
9 1/2 weeks is better than 12-steps
I keep tryin' to remind you to keep tellin' yourself
Now your conscience is interfering, like ""Better yourself!""
Like you better get help
But when that medicine's felt?
We're back together
Don't ever leave me
Don't ever let 'em tell you that you'll never need me
My China White, 'til we D.O.A
Its Montega forever, baby, lets get away

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
How could you leave me
I thought that you needed me
When the world got too much and you pleaded with me
Who helped you immediately
How speedy of me
How could you deny me so vehemently
Now your body is shaking, trying to free it of me
And your soul is in control, trying to lead it from me
And your heart no longer pledge allegiance to me
Damn, I'm missing the days when you needed the D!

She full of suprises, ionno what shell do next
But while she sleep I sneak and put hickies on her neck
And when she go out she shut down the whole set
Love to see her in the heels with the slit in her dress
She like to do her own hair and get her own check

The ballplayers know me, movie stars too
See my homie Snoop, we doin' what we do
Don't matter where we at, Miami or Vegas
Every time you ask me, yeah I'm a player
(Beotch) 'Cause I'm the life of the party
I got ten bad bitches, actin' retarded
I'm tryin' to meet a few new ones
What's up with you girl, maybe we can do somethin'
Do you drink; do you smoke?
I could tell by your purse and your shoes you ain't broke
Hang with me, the first thing you do is get stuck
Take you somewhere, later on you'll get fucked, beotch!

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B. & (Snoop Dogg)]
Hey look I'm only in town for a night
And when I pull up man the crowd get hype
And everybody love me, the browns to the whites
You live like a movie but a movie my life

And I'm the life of the party
(Every time I show up)
Yeah, I'm the life of the party
(Every time I blow up)
I'm the life of the party
(Every time I show up)
Yeah, I'm the life of the party
(Every time I blow up)

Now go and roll up the Swisher
But don't drink all my liquor
You know it's all good my nigga
Give me one second, I'll pose for your picture
Like cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese, cheese
Now everybody just freeze, freeze, freeze, freeze
Now DJ bring the music please

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I've been trappin' all day, gettin' paper
Headed to the club in my brand new scraper
Gators on my feet, money in my pocket
I gotta do a show so you know I'm 'bout to rock it
See my homie $hort, layin' low-key
I strolled over to him, and passed him the bleezy
Doggy Dogg, anything goes
Snappin' my fingers, crackin' at some hoes
What do ya know, I'm in The A gettin' play all day
A lot of y'all wanna ball and try to walk this way
Y'all want that shine-shine but that's all mine
I'm bonafied, qualified to have a hot damn time
Now listen, get the picture, and take a picture of me quick
See 'cause tomorrow I got a new city that I'm gon' hit
A double whammy, right before I do the Grammy's
I do a show with Puff Daddy way out in South Miami

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B. & (Snoop Dogg)]
Hey look I'm only in town for a night
And when I pull up man the crowd get hype
And everybody love me, the browns to the whites
You live like a movie but a movie my life

And I'm the life of the party

[Outro: Too $hort]
Count 'em mayne... there's about 12, 13, 14 bad bitches
It's me, two of my homies... drinkin', we smokin'
I see all the ballers in the house, what's up mayne?
They doin' it big over there too, but you know mayne
If I wasn't here, it wouldn't be the same
'Cause I'm the life of the party, baby
I hope you feel the same way about yourself, beotch!

I got a chip in my engine, 26 inch rims
I got fade-away money, bitch I'm ballin' out the gym
Got my old school pumpin', hip wheel on recline
If you think a nigga broke you out'cha monkey-ass mind
Diamonds on my pinky, hand on the pine
Bitch touch and now your momma do the second line
Screens fallin' from the sky, syrup fallin' in my cup
Old school Chevy thang, comin' down nigga what
Got diamonds in my mouth, got some Gucci on my seat
Got G's on my ass, bitch it's cold when I speak
Got a freak on my arm, got a charm around my neck
You can gon' pass the mic, watch I'm 'bout to catch wreck
Still screamin' out mayne, pistol in my hand
Southside so throwed
Big face on my chain, 84's on the frame
Big bodies comin' down, hoggin' up both lanes

Stuntin' ain't a thing to me and it's obvious, it's plain to see
That you gon' make us both
Get into some thangs that is for grown folks
And they might even say you should leave me alone
But don't be scared, you need to get like me
Stuntin' is a habit, just gotta have it
Shorty can throw anything at me, I'm gonna bag it
When she see the karats, a real Jessica Rabbit
Can't another boy do the things you like
He ain't your type to change your life
But if you did your homework girl, I'm pretty sure you know what I got
Drop top and you know Jones and Banner gonna roll

Let them bougie boys ride Maybach

My money stacked to the ceilin'
Gettin' in my Chevy's like climbin' up a buildin', them 28's on deck
37 on my wrist, a hundred five on my neck
This rap money's okay but you should see these movie checks
And this cartoon cash, the SS so sweet
My Bentley's hatin' on that ass, my old school's gettin' pissed
She opened up her arm but then she slit both wrists
There go the suicide do's, wood on the dash
Ferris wheels on the toes and got duals on the ass
And some chrome on the nose, the white boys go, ""Sweet""
But black folks go, ""Oh,"" I got a 'llac full of ammo
I'm brick with the nine throwin' bombs out the Lambo'

I got Chad in my heart and DJ Screw in my cup

I'm payin homage cause, you've paved the way for meeee, ye-yeah

I swear to God, it feel like every day is my birthday
Let the top down, California's my birthplace
So I'mma take you there like B.I.G took niggas to New York
""Juicy"" had us feelin like we was from New York
And that's real shit, blazed the Philly
It's ""Summertime"", shout out to Will Smith
Cause who didn't wanna be the Fresh Prince?
Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks
My nigga Nas told me ""Money Make the World go Round""
And Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85
She had her ups and downs but she stayed alive
I used to think LL stood for ""Love LA""
He from Queens, how the fuck he put that with Cool J?
Red Kangol hat, red sweatsuit to match
Red Adidas, nigga, Game is back

Is all my boombox had to say
""Today was a Good Day"" had the hood buzzin
Ice Cube my favorite rapper, y'all niggas can't tell me nothing
Everybody first bootleg was ""Boyz N the Hood""
Whoever thought gangsta rap would make noise in the hood?
When the cars ride by with the ""Boomin' System""
Two door Mustang, and the roof was missin'
Every girl at your school had the new extensions
Even gangstas was dancin' like New Edition
Cause the house parties stayed rockin all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was alright (alright)
Cause after the cops left, it was a party then
You down with O.P.P.? Then bring Naughty in
They say ""It Never Rain in Southern California"", Tony! Toni! lied
Sit back, watch Game throw his money in the sky

In the back, I relax with all the hunnies
DJ bring it back, let it go
Mix it in with Black Rob, make 'em say ""WHOA!""
Everything full circle, Game livin' major
Girls on my hip like a Skytel pager
Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky cause The Game don't stop
Just a little more change, gotta Benz and the Range
Every rap metaphor always ends in my name
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts
Before I was born they was talkin 'bout The Game
Ask a Jay-Z fan 'bout Big Daddy Kane
Don't know him, Game gonna show 'em
Just like they showed me, my lyrics is O.G
When it's all said and done, you niggas gon' quote me

‘Cause I'm comin' home again
(Min' home again)

[Verse 1]
I met this girl when I was 3 years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, lil homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees""
And from that point I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tore 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat
‘Cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep making that, keep making that
Keep making that platinum and gold for me!""

Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2]
But if you really cared for her, then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her
It always seems like she talking 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you"" and I just got through
Talking 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yo, Drew and Inf, this right here is crazy
I feel big, you know what I mean?
Like not big in the sense of weight, you know what I mean?
Like gainin' weight or nothin' like that, like colossal
Know what I mean, like (*sighs*)
I heard you were lookin' for me

[Hook: Sha-ron Prescott (Lil Wayne)]
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him)
Tell me, where have you been?
(Around the world, now I'm back again)
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
(Who been askin' about me?)
They've been wondering why (In case you wonderin')
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him)
Tell me, where have you been?
(Around the world, now I'm back again)
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why (Hahahah)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, to you forever, from me to you
I heard somebody say ""Church,"" I'ma need a suit
I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than ""Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice""
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof
So I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do? But I'ma leave it to
God, not Beaver, neither you
‘Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O and even U
Man, I got Summer hatin' on me 'cause I'm hotter than the Sun
Got Spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall
I'm being hated by the seasons
So fuck y'all who hatin' for no reason

[Hook: Sha-ron Prescott (Lil Wayne)]
Hey, Mr. Carter (I am him!)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I been in and out the bank, bitch
While y'all asshole niggas been on the same shit
I flush and watch 'em go down the drain quick
Two words you never hear: ""Wayne quit!""
‘Cause Wayne win and they lose
I call them April babies, ‘cause they fools
And when they snooze, we up
Feet up, like a parapleguc
Or paraplegic? I parallel park
In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Su-Woo and ""Da-da-do""
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

[Hook: Sha-ron Prescott (Jay-Z)]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Young! I am him!)
Tell me, where have you been?

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I'm right here in my chair with my crown and my dear
Queen B, as I share mic time with my heir
Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy to Murcielago
Far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
It's my go, yeah…
And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status-quo
Flow so pro
I know I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, ""What up, Killa?""
Man, stop bringin' up my past!
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay Z
Don't forget Weezy, baby

[Hook: Sha-ron Prescott (Lil Wayne)]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why? (Haha)
Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Hova!)
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching (Weezy)
They've been wondering why? (Baby!)

[Hook: Choir (Lil Wayne)]
Hey, Mr. Carter (Hahaha)
Tell me, where have you been? (I been hustlin')
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
(Hustlin' hard) They've been wondering why?
(Chyeaa) Hey, Mr. Carter
Tell me, where have you been?
'Cause they've been asking, they've been searching
They've been wondering why?

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Ahh, we'll lose two lives: yours and mine
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve
At the funeral parlor, drippin' tears down my sleeve
Give me any amount of time, don't let Ms. Carter grieve

We can hear the angels calling us
We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thang, I'll make that body sang
I make it say

[Bridge: Bobby Valentino]
Maybe you can lock me up and throw away the key
Call your sergeant and tell him you can't finish your shift
Cause it's on tonight
Breakfast in bed turns to breakfast and head
And I can't wait to get it on
I wanna do it all night long, Mrs. Officer

[Hook: Bobby Valentino]
When I get up all in ya
We can hear the angels calling us
We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thang, I'll make that body sang

[Intro: Ludacris & Chris Brown]
Luda, SG, Chris Breezy, it's me
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Hook: Chris Brown & Sean Garrett]
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like

[Verse 1: Ludacris & Sean Garrett]
Relax and take notes, while I put you up on game
Get a sweeter connect then if I put you up on 'caine
But you should grab yourself a seat and a whiskey double
Because the girls of the world ain't nothin' but trouble!
They like a little danger and might not admit it
But they on for the chase and they want us to come and get it
Plus they love a young thug that's overflowin' with swag
And keeps his woman all draped in new Louis Vuitton bags
And Louis Vuitton pumps, look at her walk to him
I like open toe straps, but SG talk to him
I got a whole bunch of girls I'm tryna bring by the crib tonight
Better wear your cape 'cause the bringin' the kryptonite

[Hook: Chris Brown & Sean Garrett]
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Now some of them want a family, a sense of security
A necklace, bracelets and all other types of jewelry
So shop 'til you drop, or 'til it makes you psychotic
Here's a triple black card, it ain't trickin' if you got it
Others will stay content if you just makin' 'em laugh
Send 'em to the spa, get 'em massaged and bubble bathed
Later on they can dance and throw a drink in they hand
And try every and anythin' they never did with they man, me
So get loose and slide off ya damn garments
Show 'em who's the boss, they take orders from the sergeant
There's places on your body that I'm just tryin' to find
So in the sack, talk to me, tell me whats on your mind
An I got plenty more to learn if you's investin' in me
They don't love for who I am but who I destined to be
And for that, I'd give you everythin' up under the sun
'Cause in the end all girls just wanna have fun

[Hook: Chris Brown & Sean Garrett]
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like
I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls
I know, I know what them girls, I know, I know what them girls like
I know what they feel 'cause I'm breathin' on they heels
And it's me they wanna kill 'cause I give them what the girls like

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
They wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen
If you can't take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen
'Cause a ride or die man for his ride or die chick
Gets that ride or die puddin' for that ride or die dick
I say they wanna talk to ya, so shut up and listen
If you can't take the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen
'Cause a ride or die man for his ride or die chick
Gets that ride or die puddin' for that ride or die dick

Women, I love you all, there's not enough time

No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Mr. West is in the buildin'
Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion
Ayo, I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the Pilgrims
Thanksgiving, do we even got a question?
Hermes pastel, I pass the dressing
My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent
So I guess we should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track, I asthma attack it
""Why you so mad for? Why you gotta have it?""
‘Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
Tryin' to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan

[Hook: M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
(No one on the corner…) Got a bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans, ‘cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans, ‘cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh
Checkin', checkin' my fresh; checkin', checkin' my fresh
Follow my steps is the road to success
Where the niggas know you're thorough
When the girls say yes (yes)
But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school, but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks; I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap
It's Hooooovaaaah
Dippin' different Rovers, whippin' with the soda
Hooooovaaaah
Did you even have any doubt after Doubt it was over?

[Hook: M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
No one on the corner has swagger like moi
Church, but I'm too clean for the choir
I require what I desire. I got stripes; Adidas
Mamis scream, ""¡Papi, no más!""
Run up in your shit, just me, no más
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagger like these four guys
Now when it comes to styles, I got several
Sharper than the swag or dagger all metal
And my jewels blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet, make you feel special
Ha! What the fuck you boys talking 'bout?
I know it's us, ‘cause we the only thing to talk about

[Hook: M.I.A.]
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us

[Verse 4: T.I.]
You can go see Weezy for the wordplay
Jeezy for the bird play
Kanyeezy for diversity, and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect, only spit to serve a purpose
You ain't livin' what you kickin', then you worthless
Looking from the surface
It may seem like I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work to see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried about is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me, even if they rap they ass off
Blast off, and have outstanding quality
Sell a lot of records, I'll respect it and salute that
But spittin' real life on hot beats I'm the truth at
You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February, with extraordinary swag

Never been fake cause all the girls love official

Black car, white rims - can they both get along?
This is not The Matrix, but I am the oracle
Do you wanna get with me? The question is rhetoricle
Say the same lines but the fans aren't bored of me
75,000 dollars if you want to order me
Hold on!! Let me change my swag

Bow makes the girls go crazy - they wanna be my lady
How many can I fit in my 2-seater Mercedes?
Lime green lambo, no roof, that's a drop top
Stop they hating, cause they girlfriend's on my jock
I let her lick the rapper, let her lick the actor
The next Will Smith and be ballin' like the Raptors
If you don't want no drama in the club then don't act up!
How can I run out? My money's longer than a tour bus!

Stop lookin at what you ain't got
Start bein thankful for what you do got

Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey

Hey, never mind what haters say, ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
You'd still be wastin days away now had I never saved the day
Consider them my protege, homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein gracious they violate in a major way
I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay' you know they couldn't get work on Labor Day
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way, not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away
Been thuggin all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away

I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with
The spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still'll grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever havin problems with their record sales just holler Tip
If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow Tip
I got love for the game, but ay I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame, and rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin and the hollerin, back and forth with the arguin
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin
Them checks into your bank account, and you up out of poverty
Your values is a disarray, prioritizin horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

[Hook]
You're gonna be, a shinin star
In fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far

Got everybody watchin what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin awayyyyyyy
So keep on gettin your paper, and keep on climbin
Look in the mirror, and keep on shinin (shinin)
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
Livin the life, the life
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do
I'm livin my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin my life, my liiiife
And I'll never stop it

(OHHH!) Y'all know the order
Tell 'em ten Rose's and a few cold waters (Right!)
Only Petron and a couple of lemons (Let's go)
Ten thousand dollars stuffed up in the denims (What else)
We standin on couches, a couple of women (Hey baby)
We was ballin hard it was just the ninth inning (It's early)
He told shorty we could be friends (Yep)
And your friends could meet my friends (What else)
And we could do this on the weekend or on the weekday
We could do this on the freeway and get it in the freak way
SHIT! We could get in on three way (Oh)
Blackberry two way, souped up cars on the thruway (Yep)
We superstars no Lupe, we could do this like a duet
But y'all be the singers on the mic, wait let me dim the lights
This was in the car while I was stoppin at the light

[Hook: Ron Browz]
How we ball in the club I know you hate it
Mommy dancin on the floor all like she naked
When she lay down with you I know she fake it
All the girls give it to me I ain't gotta take it
OHHHH! Pop champagne!
OHHHH! Pop champagne!
OHHHH! We pop champagne!
OHHHH! We pop champagne!

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
Baby I wanna see you work (Go) See you dance (Go)
Without no shirt, without those pants
Pop champagne ain't a damn thing change
Spray it in the air make it champagne rain
Buckets of ice keep the champagne cool
Mommy got a body see that damn thing move
It's no sex in the champagne room
Says who? Baby I'll break all rules
Bring it here and I'll break off you
She see me in V.I.P. and wanna break on through
When she with you, she lyin, but she fake it
When she with me, she like it, she never fake it

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Uh, would you ride for me? Would you die for me?
Had no money, would you still love me?
If I got jammed up and did a little time
Would you still be the woman who gon' hold it down?
Through the hard times and them cloudy days
Would you stand strong? Would you run away?
All the bullshit and all the heartache
She still ridin' with a nigga since the first day
Her ambitions of a rider
She would be around if I never had a dollar
She would be my nurse if I ever need a doctor
Bonnie and Clyde, she never side with the coppers
Never break code, forever be loyal
Never break ties 'til we buried in the soil
If it ever go down, she tryna go too
Down for whatever bullshit I'm goin' through
And I gotta hold on, know that she my backbone
Nothin' like that feelin' when I'm in her so long
Passion and that lovin' that between us so strong
Grippin' on that ass, she just tell me, ""Hold on""
And she can be the wife, maybe one day
Have a few kids, go and travel out the state
She gon' ride or die for a nigga 'til the grave
And I hope it never change

Them other hoes, yeah, they mad, so what?
Me and you for life, team us
Big face Rollies, you can get the same one
I'm in that Mulsanne, you in that coupe, what?
Ain't that many people 'round that I do trust
You the last of a dyin' breed
Ride for me, baby, everythin' is guaranteed
Anythin' you ever wanted, or ever need
Turn life out of any dream
I mean that, keep it 100, when I need that, she gon' come runnin'
When I fiend for it, give that ass to me
Never tell her no, she get the last from me
If I get jail, gotta go to court, she be right there, need I say more? Love

Bottom line, I need your L-O-V-I-N

He such a small fella, to recognize the Mason Martin Margiela
What could I tell her
Man I swear you got to see her to believe her
Then maybe you could understand why I need her
Besides her bein a diva she wasn't bothered by the chiba
Zodiac sign was a libra
Definetly a keeper, I just wanna put her in a sleeper then fall out underneath her
Wake up, take a shower, then get deeper
Juice up get some power and then freak her
After the feedback then I could G Mack
But it's somethin about her love makin me need that, come on!

Yo, they say every good woman needs a thug
I totally agree, that's why I need your love (yep)
And I can't help it, if I'm selfish
Cause I need your love and nobody else's
Startin to taste it, pardon the bracelet (padon)
Chance of a lifetime and I can't waste it
If bein beautiful was a test, should've aced it
Her skin is flawless, her hair is waist length
Hi I'm Jason, ma I'm patient-ly waitin for us to have relations
Kissin me is just history in the makin
Squeezin and huggin I need your lovin, come on!!!

It was Friday night and I was feelin aight (yup)
Downtown Atlanta, big city, bright lights
Mixin Henny with the Sprite while I'm drinkin and drivin
No police lights (lights) no police sirens
I'm headed to the club, lookin for a freak (freak)
To spread a little love and spread a couple cheeks (cheeks)
Pull up to the spot 26's like BAM!
Eyes on me like, ""Bitch do you SEE 'EM?""
Strolled through the front do' headed to the VIP (VIP)
Bought a couple bottles and I took a couple sips (sips)
Scopin out the room, and what do I SEE?
A nice round butt, and a pair of double D's!
So I crept up like, ""Shorty what's happenin
You killin that dress and I love it with a passion""
Then she turned around and her face was aight
She had a gap tooth and a mean overbite, but I was like hmmmm

[Hook: T-Pain]
Yeah yeah; if I take one more drink, I'm gon' end up fuckin you
Is that what you wanna do, shorty?
If I take one more drink, I'm gon' end up fuckin you
You too, ooh ooh ooooh

Woke up the next mornin and all I can remember
Was takin shots and tippin the bartender
Surrendered to the woman end up bringin me home
Cause she started lookin better every shot of Patron, yup!
I jumped up with a devilish grin
Cause tonight, damn right I might do it again
So I called up the homies (whattup) let's ride
We can hit the sports bar over on the Southside (aight)
Get a couple of Coronas, couple of limes (yup)
Went up to the bar and saw a couple of dimes
So I, slowly walked up and said hi
My name's Ludacris and I'm a hell of a guy
One said ""I know who you are, I'm your number one fan
And right now it's too bad I got a man""
And I said I understand (I understand)
But where the hell is he at cause in a minute if he don't show up then mannnnn

Talkin 'bout how you're my biggest fan girl (I know it, I know it!)
Now I don't wanna do (please) what you're gon' make me do
(Don't make me do it, don't make me do it!)
But I, if I have more drink

[Ludacris]
One mo' drink I'mma get ya home then I'll split ya
Grab the camera phone and take a bunch of drunk pictures
Cause Hennessy mixed with a whole bunch of buddah
Equals you mixed with a whole bunch of Luda
And you know how far one drink could go
Start slurrin my speech slowin up the flow
Hikin up ya skirt, climbin up ya shirt
It's Mr. Late Night Luda and I like to flirt
So guess what baby girl!

Just one mo', that's all it's gon' take

Walking around looking for a way
But no one tells me which way to go
I'm caught up in a world
A Labyrinth, a maze
Where yes men could easily be known
I ask them no questions
They give me no answers
Following the wise
But they're walking in pampers
Give me a cigarette
Smoking my cancer
Drink the pain away
But I still have no answers

[Hook 1: Gorilla Zoe]
I'm lost on a road
Don't know which way to go
I'm losing my mind
Losing control of the wheel
And I'm swerving
On and off the road
I'm lost on a road
But survival is a must
Don't know who I can trust
I'm livin in a rush
I don't understand this fuss
My brain is bout to bust

[Hook 2]
I think I'm losin it
I might be losin it
I just might lose
Am I losin my mind?
And I'm so confused I don't know what to do
And I need a clue before I run out of time
Am I losin it?
Am I losin it?
I think I'm losin
I'm losin my mind
Am I losin it?
Am I losin it?
I think I'm losin

I call up my girlfriend she dosen't answer
I hit the strip club and fuck with a dancer
Throwing my ones up, like I'm paying ransom
Told me I look good, she said I was handsome
So believed her, because I am lonely
Im just a loner, my life is a movie
Tonight we're just actors, and this is a sitcom
So tell me you love me, and tell me i'll get some

Just to go spend it

And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green
And my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white
Now how much you trying to pay?
Let's go

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I said I woke up this morning
Headache this big
Pay all these damn bills
Feed all these damn kids
Buy all these school shoes
Buy all these school clothes
For some strange reason my son addicted to Polo's
Love me some spinach dip
I'm addicted to Houston's
And if the numbers is right
I'll take a trip out to Houston
An earthquake out in China
A hurricane in New Orleans
Street Dreams Tour, I showed my ass in New Orleans
Did it for Soulja Slim
Brought out B.G
It's all love, Bun
I'm forgiving you, Pimp C
You know how the Pimp be
That nigga gon' speak his mind
If he could speak down from Heaven
He'd tell me stay on my grind
Tell him I'm doing fine
Obama for mankind
We ready for damn change
So y'all let the man shine
Stuntin' on Martin Luther
Feeling just like a king
Guess this is what he meant
When he said that he had a dream

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
My President is black
My Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home
And daddy's still in jail
Trying to make a plate, anybody seen the scale
My President is black
My Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green
And my Jordans light grey
And they love to see white
Now how much you trying to pay?
Let's go

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yeah, our history, black history
No president ever did shit for me
Had to hit the streets, had to flip some keys
So a nigga won't go broke
Then they put us in jail, now a nigga can't go vote
So I spend dough on these hoes strippin'
She ain't a politician, honey's a pole-itician
My president is black, Rose golden charms
22-inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of peoples is riled up to see you
That can arouse your ego. We've got mouths to feed, so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
Cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity, never lose your integrity
For years there's been some prize horses in this stable
Just two albums in, I'm the realest nigga on this label
Mr. Black President, yo, Obama for real
They gotta put your face on the 5000 dollar bill

[Hook: Young Jeezy]
My president is black
My Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too

I was the first nigga to ride through my hood in a Lamborghini

Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
This is black hoodie rap
There's no fear in my eyes where they lookin' at
Better look on map, besides, me nah like to eye fight
Me nah think such a ting is worth a man's life (Christ!)
But if a man test my Stuy
I promise he won't like my reply
Boom bye bye, like Buju I'm crucial
I'm a Brooklyn boy I may take some gettin' use to
Chain snatchin', ain't have it, gotta get it
Same shitted, from Brownsville to Bainbrid-idge
Fatherless child, mama pulled double shifts
So the number runners was the only one I hanged widith
Before you know it I'm in the game, bang fidith
Fear no orangutans, pe-deal cid-daps
Like oranges-es, I'm dangerous
Please, tell me what the name of this shit

Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard

I father, I Brooklyn Dodger them
I jack, I rob, I sin
Aww man, I'm Jackie Robinson
'Cept when I run base, I dodge the pen
Lucky me, luckily, they didn't get me
Now when I bring the Nets, I'm the black Branch Rickey
From Brooklyn corners, burnin' branches of sticky
Spread love, Biggie, Brooklyn, hippie
I pity the fool with jewels like Mr. T
With no history in my borough, they borrow
With no intentions of returnin', tomorrow
The sun don't come out for many, like Annie
Half orphan, mama never had an abortion
Papa sort of did, still I managed to live
I go hard, I owe it all to the crib
Now please tell me, what the fuck's harder than this?

Brooklyn we go hard, we go hard

[Verse 3: Santigold]
While I'm doin' my time due to circumstance
Cross that bridge, face the consequence
Once bid 10 now I paid my dues
Risk takers we break the rules
Get so dark, but I see good
Bed-Stuy stay high in my neck of the woods
Now, let it ring out, it's a warning
(Brooklyn) Let it be sworn in
Gotta make it stick workin' like we blue collar
Rip it to the core, underneath it all we harder
Right into the clip, bring it to the floor
One step, one step, give it up more
The road is rough and the street's a mess
Got big cash dreams and a sick death wish
Robbin' out the commercial stash
Kill the voice screamin' in my head

Ever had one of them days wish you would've stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong; you reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin'
You to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, plus it hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist down, now you're wheel chair bound
Nevermind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead at the old projects
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take time to think
Before I make mistakes just for my family's sake

Situation could've been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin', and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know we cappin'
Get locked up then, didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walking out that door
Who'd have thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'd have took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nigga put his hands on me – alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
‘Cause I hit you, you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now I'm straight

With a record of 17 rapes
400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed
Most diabolical villain in the world: Slim Shady!

[Hook: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model; you just hit the lotto
Uh oh, uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun, and no, not one of them got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
(Okay, let's go!)

Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us, it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
‘Cause when I spit the verse
The shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by, they're like, ""Oh my""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick, ‘cause I know why
I dip through in that six tre, like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A
‘Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions; garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face, though

[Hook: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model; you just hit the lotto
Uh oh, uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun, and no, not one of them got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn
And we're starting this party from dusk
(And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent!)

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuana—do what you want!
Nigga, on and on, 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo shoes, I say move a bitch, move

[Hook: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model; you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun, and no, not one of them got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them
And there's really not that many of us

Baby, you a true thoroughbred, a born winner
I expect you to be magnificent
It's the boss
It gets no better than this

[Hook: John Legend]
Swimmin' in women, champagne sippin'
Gold emblem with, two M's in it
This pimpin' is so magnificent
Stop dreamin' it, I'm livin' it!
Oh I, I can show you
Show you better than I can tell you
Oh I, I can show you
Oh I, oh I, oh I

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm the Magnificent with a sensational style
Far from bein' shallow cause she caught me with a smile
Try to figure out my style, baby that'll take a minute
But if all we got is time, you can't be actin' timid
So we back to playin' tennis, meanin' goin' back and forth
She the one that I adore, so I tried to enter raw
Conscience intervenes, concentratin' on my cream
I'm the king, make a move, pawns all the way to Queens
I'm a don, I'm a boss, I'm a profit, I'm a G
I'm a CEO, which means that I profit off of me
All white tees, still rockin' my Nike Airs
Fresh outta flight school, cause I'm fly right here
Ain't nothin' free, I'm chargin' to breathe air
If it's not on Maybach, really who the hell cares?
My money long, my nigga my money strong
If you ain't gettin' money that mean you done somethin' wrong

I'm the Magnificent with a sensational style
Down to all of my automobiles, with no miles
Yellow Corvettes, black rally stripes
And I never phone ahead, all she do is hear the pipes
Project bitches, upscale kittens
Fuck her for a minute, that night we countin' digits
Maybach money so I always had a vision
I would always tell my niggas but, ain't nobody listened
Words work magic, haters wreak havoc
Ain't nothin' on my back, but the delicates of fabrics
I made a transition from the thieves
To the biggest executive Def Jam's ever seen
Lyor's dream, Sean John suit
And a S. Dot ring, Chandon for my crew
Bad hoes in pursuit, Masspike on a two
Gunplay he a glue, goon with a attitude, holla

I'm the Magnificent with a sensational style
When I decorate a home, marble flowin' like the Nile
Nigga you a clown, here's the number you should dial
Yeah it start with 305, but we end at four pound
""Sak pase"" to Zoe Pound, for lifers in O-Town
All them Carol City killers, they're likin' it broke down
Money is a must, tommy guns on a bus
Allan Zamren on the case, so you know what you could suck
Wear red all the time, but really I'm color blind
Wanna catch my attention nigga? Throw up a dollar sign
One time for the Crips, young G's buyin' cribs
And I smoke wit Vice Lords when I visit Mississip'
The game never change, money still a focal
But it's time to rape the game, like Puffy did Total
Like Rev Run in the tub, still smokin'
In memory of Shakir, Boss gotta shout Oakland

See me come up from nothing, see me living my dreams

I got nothing but love, now that I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame, money ain't goin' to shame?

How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever, that's just how I'm designed

Picture you facing a charge, picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed, picture you wearing the scar
Thank you for making me struggle, thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine
You've been seeing me lately, I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father, trying to hope for tomorrow

Wear the gun like a outfit
Live by the sword, turnin' up with my down bitch
Niggas never see the bullet coming, that's a round kick
Lost my mind when the homie got found dead
That's some shit, I don't take shit but a trip
Got a hundred in the clip, trip, dump it in ya hip
Where the bitches, I'm lookin for the bitches
Seen so much shit man, it's hard to be religious
But I fear God hear alot when you fucked the whole cheer squad
Young nigga ballin', send shots, killer , tear drop
Get these hoes on deep, two 3's in a box
Do what I do, I shoot do-do-do-do
Airin' the fuck out this bitch
I get rough with a bitch
She cute but, she don't take enough of the dick
Ran through the whole clique, they all runnin' from the dick
Man, I pray my daughter never fall in love with a pimp
Baby, Karma is mug, and I done hurt so many people selling drugs
Yeah, i'm the plug
Got my heat up in the glove

They say that what happen in the dark come to light sermon?
Better adapt, learn to react, don't get clapped, murdered
I put the tape on my mama, got my momma nervous
I'm observant
Watching niggas steal all my shit
Bitch left cuz there ain't no room on my dick
Re'd Up 2 told a nigga bout' a bitch
Now they tryna catch up, so they rappin like thiiiiiiisss
I make change, I ain't break a bill

Gave her the recipe, now she Mrs. Fields

I feel, like i'm the realest, eva-eva-eva-eva, eva-eva

In and out the lanes, dippin through the traffic
We ain't hustlin no more, we doin gymnastics
Couple of flips and then stash it, bastards
Real gon' recognize real
Phony gon' recognize steel, I reckon I will
Expose those who are, if you ain't or you are
I done gone too far, sorry, MWAH
Get yourself a fresh flesh wound or a new scar
Bullet holes all on the side of your new car
Load up the AR, spray y'all, okay y'all?
It's real on this side, phony wherever they are, what!

E-e-Echo

[Verse 1]
You did it to yourself
Now you're all by your self
Acting like you hate me
I left because you made me
You played me to the left
Now there's nobody left
To hear your complaining
I'm gone and all you're hearin' is your own

[Hook]
E-echo!
E-e-echo!
And I'm gone
And your all alone
Can't you hear the hear the
Echo!
E-echo!
No one to hear you
There's nobody near you

[Verse 2]
It started off great
But who was to know
That love that is lost
Cannot be let go
You say it's my fault
Ok then i'll go
It's better to know
Now there's nobody to argue with
Cause I'm not home
Don't care who your with
Don't call my phone
Or did you forget
You know your wrong
I'm gone!
And your all alone hearing your own damn

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Disgusted with trust
I trust no one no more
Just went with the flow
Found myself on the floor
When you went away
All my pain went astray
Like it's a new day
Now I have no one to argue with
Cause I'm not home
Don't care who your with
Don't call my phone
Or did you forget
You know your wrong
I'm gone!
And your all alone
Hearing your own damn

Echo
Your own damn
E-echo
No one is near you
No one can hear you
With your own damn
Echo!
E-echo!
No one to hear you
There's nobody near you

All night long
I thought to myself
Why would I stay with you
Realized that you were the one who had issues
So why would I miss you?

No one to argue with
Cause I'm not home
Don't care who you're with
Don't call my phone
Or did you forget
You know your wrong
I'm gone!
And your all alone

Hearing your own damn echo!
It's just you and your

Got no need, she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
All-all-all-all-all-all we do is shop until we drop
(Just throw it in the bag, bag)

You know we had to go shopping one more time, right?
I think we forget somethin, haha, haha
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
I said if you gettin money, if you gettin money
If you gettin money, just throw it in the bag

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
It's Mr. ""Throw It In The Bag"", I just throw it in the bag
I don't know how much it cost but I know this bitch is bad
Walk up to that register like I ain't know it had a tag
I'm no liar I don't front, I'm a buy her what she want
Cause your queen 'posed to get what she desire, what she want
If my lady like to eat, then I'm a buy her restaurants
And she such a boss bitch, she can hire who she want
She can help me blow this green, she the fire to my blunt
You can try her if you want, bet it's gon' cost you
Bags with the G's, jeans with the horseshoe
She can go to work or chill like a boss do
That nigga ain't ya nigga unless he endorse you
They sayin it ain't trickin if you got it, they lyin

Every time we leave the manager say ""come again""
Honestly she's probably old enough to be my mama friend
She just want that feeling back, I make her feel young again
If her card declined, you need to check that shit and run again
They don't give you limits when you keep that money comin in
Yeah, just fold some paper around the magnet
As soon as it approve you can throw it in the bag
She mature to say the least
And if I get a car then she make sure to pay the lease
She used to have a husband 'til she found out that he cheats
And then she filed for divorce and watch her bank account increase
She got a condo with a view, a house with a pool
Her son is 26 but he just went away to school
She always show me pictures of him, tell me that's her baby
I hope that I never meet him, that nigga look craaaaazy
And I be spendin all my lady chips
She got me feeling like my daddy back in '86
Yeah, she say she lucky that she his
No, I'm lucky that you mine baby, you know what it isssss

Shorty so nice, I don't mean polite
When I say nice, I mean lookin right
And you can't put a price on something lookin right
If they ask how much, tell em what it's lookin like
Everything I buy fly, it's like I'm bookin flights
If I want it, I'm a get it, that should not be tooken light
And that's on everything I got a crazy lady
So Money Ain't A Thang Jay-Z, J.D

Aw yeah, Trey, I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothing realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
A lot of ya'll are still sounding like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
I know that it's coming, I just hope that I'm alive for it

Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, a lot of shit been going sideways
And my mother try to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soaking wet, she only 5'2""
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hoping I never have to fit in
So try to keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is looking like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though cause I want the:

Alright well, umm alright.  You’ll just have to do it without me
You know what you do… you know what you do nigga. You making it to the top, all the way to the top. You need to go further than mine, and not the money, you know what I’m saying

I want the money, money and the cars

Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alisha hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treading water, steady trying to swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me ""Shopping Bag Drizzy""
Or call me Mr. ""Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?""
And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy
While this young'n that you doubted is about to get busy
I'mma kill it, I promise, that's how I know you're mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't asking for much, all I want is the

Yeah, its like, like I know what i gotta say
I just don’t know how to say it, to you

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Pardon the swag, but bitch it's Car-tey
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake, how come I can't
Miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait
And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray
And I'mma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearing bullshit, bring on the cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than our shit
And that's word to Toronto
So high up, I got birds in the condo
Ha, ain't that a female dog
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell ""God""

Said, ""bitch, you should do it for the love like Ray J""

Daddy needs shoes and kids gotta eat
They can have every last Penney on me
Me and swizzy rollin in the lambo
Sit back reminiscing this and when I never had no
Dollas, pride is well poor dear mama
Stuck to the fight like a drained out boxer
So I know what it feels like to not have much
I should give away what I made last month
I gotta alot to feel good about
I think I’m gonna give away a good amount

(hook)

One shot for my niggas in the state pen
Two shots for my niggas still hustling
I feel good
I’m so good
Man I rose from the bottom and it feels good

Man I’m a introduce to you a new dance
It’s called the money dance
You pull the money out your pocket like this
You put your hands in the air like this
And you simply just umm
Bounce throw it all around
(Throw) throw it all around x3
A little more now
Throw it all around

Sent me a dirty text

Now I got one in the cage, and I got two on the stage
I got a waitress on the under, tryin' to give me some face
They play some Lil' Wayne
Mixed with some T-Pain
They mashed the Journey record, now they dropped some Coldplay

Mami took a bus trip and now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can’t save you, life starts when the church ends
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feeling like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
New York, concrete jungle
Where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can’t do
Now you’re in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air
Everybody say: ""Yeah!""

[Hook: Alicia Keys]

Where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can’t do

Come take a look, get a load of this nigga
Quit fronting on me, don't come around
And try come gas me up, I like running on E

On records I'm Captain Hook and my new car is ""Rufio""
Damn, where my roof just go? I'm somebody that you should know
Get to shaking something cause that's what Drumma produced it for
Yes I make mistakes that I don't ever make excuses for

Ballin' up: we keep the cash on deck
Lamborghini and the Bentleys on the V-set
Louis lens iced up with the black diamonds
Cartier, Ferrari the new Spider
No lie, I'm higher than I ever been
Born rich, born Uptown, born to win
Fully loaded, automatic 6 Benz
Candy paint, foreign lights with my bitch in
Born hustling, too big nigga to size me up
Count stunting, more money - burn 'em up

That kush - I promise that's my dude
But we don't smoke that Reggie Bush

She got that good good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her - no Stevie Wonder
She don't ever wonder, cause she know she bad
And I got her, nigga: grocery bag

Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue, baby
Wanna spend it all on you, baby

Call me Mr. Flintstone, I can make your bed rock
Oh, I can make your bed rock

Okay, I get it, let me think, I guess it's my turn
Maybe it's time to put this pussy on your sideburns
He say I'm bad, he prob'ly right
He pressing me like button-downs on a Friday night
I'm so pretty like, be on my pedal bike
Be on my low starch, be on my egg whites
He say, ""Nicki don't stop, you the bestest""
And I'd just be coming off the top, asbestos

I race for your love, ""Shake'n Bake"" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her
I let her see the Aston and let the rest surprise her
That's when we disappear, you need GPS to find her
Oh, that was your girl? I thought I recognized her

She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters, and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it. Where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment

[Verse 6: Jae Millz]
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless
Well, that's what you are, how I see it is how I call it
Yeah, look, look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad

Left my glove so white you thought I brought Jermaine with me
'Bout to paint a perfect picture like I brought the frame with me

And I did it all for you
Still, you were lonely
We could have worked it out

It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved
That person has it all
You just stuck standin' there
But I'm gonna need you to say something, baby

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
It really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see
Your life is good but me and you it’s catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy
It's crazy, I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change
Ah, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect girl, now it seems we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?

This is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, cause it's 'all about location'
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You should have been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up, 50 - 50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should want to go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gonna be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
As long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?

Bought the jeep, tore the muh'fuckin doors off
Foot out that bitch, ride the shit like a skateboard
Navigation on, tryin to find my next thrill
Feelin myself, I don't even need an X pill
Can't chill but my neck will
Haters really gon' be mad off my next deal
Uhh, I don't know why they worry 'bout my pockets
Meanwhile I had Oprah chillin in the projects

Uh, now what you boys got a death wish?
I beat a mothafucka uglier than Precious
Real nigga, you can find me where the X is
Whippin' in the kitchen, both hands ambidextrous
Recession got the hood pushin' more than time clocks
So I dropped a hundred in the streets I don't buy stocks
Tell a little mothafucka get his shine box
Goodfellas hood fellas livin' on my block
Nigga got a problem, I solve 'em (solve 'em)

Wake up to a homicide, ain't nobody dream shit (nah)
Welcome to the home of the home invasion

Went up in it like a halfback from the Raiders
Bring a half mac, anything for that paper
Two door Phantom, avatar blue though
Parked outta space shit, we call that bitch Pluto (yeeeah)
Grown livin' legend in the hood I'm a hero
On that mini fourteen like a guitar hero
Came a long way from that toilet bowl white though
But I'mma be all right though

However do you want it, Joe stay blunted
I gets off but the ho stay on it
This is my +Castle+ but it ain't +White+ though
Ice so bright shit shine like a light show
This my life yo go get yours bitch
Ball till we fall till the drugs hit the ball pit
Cocaine cowboys that's my thing
Do it for my niggas locked down in the bing in the state
In the Fed pen my name rings

Life so priceless nigga
You understand me?
It's just like that

Either you in the huddle

At the roof top
So hot up here nigga

[Chorus - Drake]
Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound
And I swear it's going down, I'm just repping for my town
Off a cup of C.J. Gibson, man I'm faded off the brown
And I'm easily influenced by the niggas I'm around
See that Aston Martin? When I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated I ain't got no cap and gown
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground

[Verse 1 - Drake]
Yeah, all hail Mister Lyrical
Spades of the Opus baby
What you got a feeling for?
I can show you new things
Have you feeling spiritual
Pastor Kerney Thomas to these hoes, miracles
Okay they say that I'm the one in fact
Some say that I'm they favorite
But I ain't hearing none of that
I'm about my team hoe, Young Money running back
Cash Money superstar, where the fuck's Stunna at?

[Verse 2 - Birdman]
Untouchable, .40 with AK
Mastermind, big money heavy weight
On the grind, flipping money in every way
Head line, my bitch shine everyday
Pearl white Dom P., Marc Jacob gloves
Cartier, Louis case with a dope plug
From the mud where they wet you, leave you in your blood
Going in flipping hundreds get the young Blood
Show them where it go
Floating on the floor
Getting more dough
Grind hard go
Black diamond show
Watch the flame blow
And how you stay grounded? Cash no go
And how you stay mounded? Cash no flow
And how you stay shining? Bentley of the floor
And how you stay high? Purple pine dro
Diamond mink's furs, February snow

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Lil Wayne]
Uh, you know you paid
When you got Baby with you
It's Young Money like Ben Frank's baby pictures
I'm a lady twister, I kiss her whiskers
I been running this shit, blisters
Sticking to the script, movie star money
And if you gassed up, I leave the car running
I'm a big smoker, I'm a little drinker
The peace sign is just a trigger and the middle finger
What you know about it? Man y'all clueless
I let two women ride me, now that's carpoolers
I rock stupid ice, Mister Water Coolers
If y'all in the building, than we are intruders
Simmer down pimping, let me handle this
I know the game, analyst
Man I'm the shit, and y'all janitors
Blow out the kush and crack a smile for the cameras

Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)
Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinkin' that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
So we livin' life like a video
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, cuz there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young

Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debatin' up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

It's our culture
From Cali to the crib, crib
Me in miami
Thank god I'm doin music
If not I'd be tying families
I'm not a asshole(oh no)
About my cash flow
Let me take this shit
And send this letter off to Castro
Ha, ha, ha Dale, come mierda

[Verse 3: Sen Dog]
We way too hot
Always coming up with something clever
La cosa nostra
Cypress Hill maca fera
Feeling fancy in the hip throne, guayabera
And we just clowning
On what we call some, money-lera
Call me Senny
Wild child from the isles
I can go forever like an old fashioned country mile
Stilo be guajiro
Latino is the lingo
I'm straight cubanichi
I bang Pinar del Rio
Lockin up this function
Just like Benny More
Go ahead and play the congas
And I'm gonna rap over it
Ya I'm a fool I'm outta here
Yes sir I gotta go
Get me some Chivas Regal
And slap me some dominos

[Verse 1 - Currency]
You think you got the bond cause I rolled you a joint?
I smoke with all mine, baby girl, what's your point?
Don't front, you in the back of a long line
Trying to get in, cause only members inside
Trees get twisted up like fingers in gang signs
Purple Kushions broke my fall, I fell from a grapevine
Super high, from the free throw line, I'm
Drexler status, glide the espionage
Many a jealous eyes scrutinze the wise
But the Jets in the house like the curtains and the blinds
It hurt to see me shine, that's why they frowning all the time
In they internet videos, digital CB4s
Angry orangutans, I'm arranging my sneakers
I'm the action on the court, you the gum stuck to the bleachers
I think I'm Paul Pierce, I think I'm Rondo
High off that headband, you dying on that hydro

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
I thought of this fresh off a bong rip
My bitch next to me, getting undressed for me
Running bath water, playing her favorite songs
While I get another one lit
Don't usually smoke at all but say tonight she'll take a hit
That's understood
From the smell, and by what I paid
You know it's good
Them niggas with me? They from the hood
Now we through parties in the sky
I'm on the 42nd floor, now that's super high
Champagne, more paper planes than you can fly
Them young niggas fell soon as they tried
When the paparazzi flash, I'll be counting all this cash
Plotting a million about how I can build a mountain out of hash

[Hook - Ne-Yo]
All these cars, all these stars, all around me (super high)
Put your eyes to the sky, that's where you'll find me
Cause we are super high

[Verse 3 - Rick Ross]
I'm getting money, no Illuminati
My pain never went in vain, it's all over my body
Get the spliff in my Mr. Bughatti
Kick it with my lil' homies, a Mr. Miyagi
I gotta buy my niggas each a pound
Tweaking up our sneaker style, passing reefer 'round
Spitting only lethal rounds, speakers beating down
Not talking munchies when I say my niggas eating now
Promoter gave me 40 thou, I think we even now
Pina colada, paper smoking, Garden of Eden now
Taylor Gang is what we bleed about
Jet setters in places you only read about

[Bridge - Wiz Khalifa]
And now, everywhere I go
It's so strong, they ask me where I get my smoke
Bitches don't have to guess, they know
I keep one rolled up, we can do whatever you want
Smoking pina colada papers, baby girl
We don't fuck with them blunts
Unless I'm with the Boss

[Verse 4 - Rick Ross]
If you looking for me, you can find me in the Guinness Book
Only fly bitches ride with the Boss, take a look
I'm super fly, I'm super high (Super duper, super duper high)

Power down your inhibitions, and power up your inner freak

But enough about me, let me think should I be worryin' about if I can handle you?

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now
Wish right now, wish right now

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah, yo… let's pretend like it's '98
Like I'm eatin' lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A (A-Town)
Hoping for a record deal to ignore my pain
Yeah, now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane
Okay, and everybody know my name (Bob)
And everywhere I go people want to hear me sang
Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring, and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination

Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes
Like I never used to run away into the blackness
Now, let's pretend like it was all good
Like I didn't live staring in the notebook
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should
But I ain't have neighbors, that's why they call it hood
Yo, now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or A.K.A. Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre (3000)
Before I ever got on MySpace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend, and make wishes out of airplanes

Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
""Marshall you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game
There ain't no way that you'll win""
Pretend he just stayed outside all day
And played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move
And schools weren't changin' again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums
And just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch
""You won't amount to shit, quit daydreamin', kid!
You need to get your cranium checked
You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic""
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him
But he didn't make it to the Rap Olympics
Slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC shit
‘Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap
So he ain't even here, he pretends that…

Sure enough, even though them chicks be hatin on us
Still I'm gonna keep her by my side, through whatever situation we gon' ride
Make all my fantasies come alive, that's no lie now

Ten million dollar mansions won't suffice
If you ain't gon' be in there with me at night
The pieces to the puzzles in my life
Through all of my good days and all of my bad
You stood by your man and you know you got my back
Worth every car, every bag, with me they wanna be that

[Verse 1: Drake]
I said ""Tell me what's really going on?""
""Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happening?""
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfucking scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake, you got 'em right?) Yeah, I got 'em Bun
I love myself cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds
And tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table stacking dollars to the perfect height
Work something, twerk something, basis
She just tryna make it so she's right here getting naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her—but I could never love her
Cause to her I'm just a rapper
And soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up
Yeah bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stands for ""Do Right And Kill Everything""
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fucking did it
And girl I'm fucking serious, I'm with it if you with it
Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealing flows cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rolling
So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowing
Cause it's on...

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, girl it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ooh shit, motherfucker, goddamn
Kicking bitches out the condo like Pam
Getting money every day, I'm a groundhog
'bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ugh, that's nasty—yes I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell their friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbates to me, that's how she learn every song
To women I condone better write me when I'm gone
No I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lying I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lying in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles I am a group
Damn, I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it I ain't tripping, I know Drizzy gonna kill 'em
I'm sticking to the script like lint on denim
Mama said if the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em
Real nigga talking, shut the fuck up, ho
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, what up, Zo?
Weezy F Baby and the ""F"" is for ""front door""
Cause that's where I bring it
Su Woo if you banging, motherfucker

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, girl it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me, and I love it
“Wait, where you going?”, “I'm leaving you”
“No, you ain't, come back!”
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snap, “Who's that dude?”, I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Hook: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe when you're with them?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit them
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah, them chills used to get them
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at them?
You swore you'd never hit them, never do nothing to hurt them
Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom in your words when you spit them
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit them
Throw them down, pin them
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know you
'Cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over
But you promised her next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Hook: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

[Hook: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don’t do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you’re the fucking coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart
I’ve always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

Independent with the demeanor of an R&B singer

Closet full of brand new clothes and handbags

I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Everybody knows I got the magic in me
When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin' at me
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ahooooooo, I got the magic in me

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind (mind)
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you with every line (ah!)
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes? (right there)
Come on down to the front and stand right here and don't be shy (Bobby)
I'll have you time travellin', have your mind babblin'
People tryin' to inherit the skill, so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes and
I see Mindfreak like ""What's up man, what's happenin'?"" (Mindfreak!)
So come one, come all and see the show tonight (ha)
Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinocchio, I never told a lie
So call me Mr. Magic Man, I float on Cloud 9, haha

[Hook: Rivers Cuomo & (B.o.B)]

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
We'll take a journey into my mind (mind), you'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd (ah)
See, see, when I rhyme I flow on the beat like pitta-da-da
See I deceive ya with my intergalactic ether (yeah)
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave ya with amnesia
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel (yeah!)
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you sayin', it don't entertain my ego
I do this everyday, Hocus Pocus is my steelo

I'm havin' a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time
She ain't tryna pop that shit for pimp; okay, well nevermind
I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothin' nice
Bracelet saying ""you should quit"", cars saying ""fuck your life""
Okay now we outta here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

That was just a keepsake, bought the president
The Louis presidential briefcase, never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks, I ain't talkin' about the peach state
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that—sweepstakes
(Ha ha ha ha ha) Fuck I look like, ho?
I look like ""yes"" and you like ""no""
I'm a bad bitch, I ain't never been a mixed breed
I'm on a diet, but I'm doin' donuts in a 6-speed

I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find the pole
Plus I be sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train, yes I'm in the building
You just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jesse James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been fly so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spinning, dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at

So hard to breathe this air that we call love
Ain't nothing worse than the hurt we receive from love
When you get hurt by the one you living for
Pain can make you wanna love no more

[Chorus]
Loving you no more
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Loving you no more
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself

Hurt with the heart thats bleeding slowly
So many lonely sleepless nights
Im going through hell to convince you love me
But never her approval no matter how I try
The way you talk to me but still I say I love you
I'm ashamed you can see it in my eyes
Momma always told me to respect the woman
But what am I to do when her parents do not try

So many tears I cried
But all for nothing I'm afraid to say
Oooooohhh

[Chorus]
Loving you no more
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Loving you no more
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself

I've been so dependent on your love for so long
Punishment for me is trying to let go
Give it from your heart is what you taught me
Addiction to pain is what it got me
My life, now its changed
My life ain't the same as you are
Heartbroken, to the point sometimes wanna end it

If I can't have what mean most to me

So many tears I cried
But all for nothing I'm afraid to say

[Chorus]
Loving you no more
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself
Loving you no more
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself

Uh, trying not to over think
Only cause I've drove and I done had a lot to drink
When I wanted it blue you said we got to paint it pink
And there's pieces of ya hair still sittin in my sink
And you still got underwear that's sittin in the dryer
How come every time that you're suspicious I'm a liar?
You stand out, I can hear you whistle in a choir
And that's the only reason you the Mrs. I admire
Damn. Tell me what I'm gone do
Since everything I'm trying to forget is all true
Me and all your main girls get along too
I would take my last dollar out and bet it on you
But ahhhhh, you see the same one I'm missing
Is basically the reason I became something different
And just that I remember me before
And if you could do the same baby then we'll be for sure

[Chorus]
Loving you no more
I just I can't I just can't be loving you no more
I love you more than I love myself

Arguing with my older bitch, acting like I owe her shit
I heard that people sing raps to give the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so yeah I had to act sane
Chi nigga but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said
""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your #1 your #2 now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy, how he hit 'em with a new style?
Know that motherfucker well: ""What you gonna do now?""
Whatever I want to do. Gosh! It's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
Cause you'll never get on top of this
So mommy, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Hook: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfucking monster
I'ma need to see your fucking hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fucking hands

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question: What do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfucking monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill the block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood-suckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Milling about, spilling they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Trying to draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster automobile, gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah I'm in that Tonka color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king but watch the queen conquer
OK, first things first I'll eat your brains
Then I'm a start rocking gold teeth and fangs
Cause that's what a motherfucking monster do
Hair dresser from Milan that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbiez got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wylin'
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really really I don't give a F-U-C-K
Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki cause she's fake
She on a diet but her pockets eating cheesecake
And I'll say bride of Chucky is child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides 'Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you and Am should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaaah, I'm a motherfucking monster

[Outro: Bon Iver]
I crossed the limelight
And I'll let God decide
And I wouldn't last these shows
So I am headed home
I crossed the limelight
And I'll let God decide
And I wouldn't last these shows
So I am headed home
I crossed the limelight
And I'll let God decide
And I wouldn't last these shows
So I am headed home

When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down, bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl whose swallow is on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space
In my 2-seater she's the one that I would take

As my goals unfold right in front of me

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

What happened to the way that we used to be?
Up late at night counting stars just you and me
Now I'm the star you feeling like you losin me
But I won't let you go, you don't know what you do to me
Like my religion you always stay true to me
That's money over women, but you got glued to me
I just want you back to light rooms with me
And in the back of my mind, jump a broom with me
Nah wait it's too soon for me
I just want some space in your heart, is there room for me?

I wanna bee with you and I cannot lie
Looking at my phone another text inside
Saying how you miss me like I just passed by
Now I'm out on the road like the Jackson 5
Say you happy for the kid, but when I'm gone you crying
When I reply you get that high
Like that's my swag girl I'm just that fly
But you gon hold me down like gravitation
Cause back at home we was passed the dating
Now I want to see your face and I passed the waiting
Thinking bout a ring got the pastor waiting

Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
Well it's not my thing trying to get back

By the time I get to one you would know that it's real
10 is your smile I ain't seen in a while
9 you're all mines and I love your sign
8 is no debate me and you look great
And 7 keep letting me know to have faith
6 is a kiss that I leave on ya cheek
5 no lies and I put it on a beat
4 so much more that we got to see
3 you just can't be without me
2 me and you always have a ball
1 I'm gon call so don't ask at all

And I got bars that I spit faster, you a hot star no bitch badder
So let me take you on a ride on a journey with the one that you call daddy, who gonna make you get it wet
But this time we gon' do something romantic and different, I'll tell you about it when we get on the movie set
I was thinking that we could just make a sex tape, plus I think yo face cute when it's in HD
Maybe I could tape you and you could tape me, when I pull my H2 up to your H3
You look like you want to be in this movie, so don't be acting like a tripping with a stranger mission
Recording you while you loving me down below, switching the camera angle when we change positions
You could be the director aiming the camera down at me, filming me licking until you say ""Cut""
Ready for any footage you wanna get ain't gotta call nobody else because I do my own stunts
It's the X rated version of a box office hit, I see you ready to strip for this
So let me get the music in, get the tape in, get the cameras in (oh oh oh oh)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Baby we don't need no script for this
I'mma throw a couple thousand baby strip for this
Let me pull my camera out and make a movie yeah
Starring you and me yeah
Baby we don't need no actresses
Let me see what I'm working with, I'mma break your back with this
Let me pull my camera out let's make a movie yeah
Starring you and me yeah yeah, girl

[Verse 2: Twista]
Shawty we gonna make a movie, got me loving it when I'm feeling on the booty
Especially when I can blame it on the alcohol, cause it do some thing to me
She look better than any chick in my perimeter, sexy, I wish I could film every bit of her
Kissing right down to her stomach and then I'mma, tell her we could be in our personal cinema
I let you hold the camera first and then I hold it then, cause I wanna see how it's coming out and going in
Let you see such a freak in me. I hope this never leak on TMZ, this is 50 World Star or CNN
Baby girl you kick the world off the axis, I'm no director, filming you for practice
And you know I think you a hell of a actress, especially when I'm shooting you on a mattress
Shawty straight to the top that's where we headed and I'mma see my name in the credits and be the shit if you let it
See something that you not really feeling, then we can always go back and make an edit
I'll be sipping on patron platinum, she knew about the rapping, but didn't know I'd be on acting

But I'm 'bout spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game
My soul started to rot, fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow; you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood

Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She find pictures in my e-mail
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good with that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

[Hook: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Run away from me, baby, run away
Run away from me, baby, run away
When it starts to get crazy, why can't she just, run away?
Baby, I got a plan, run away fast as you can

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfucking top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the balla-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless
P!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you are at an advantage
Cause you can blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'mma manage
If one day you just up and leave

[Hook: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been putting up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

I'm only human dog, can you, hear me?
I'm only human dog, it's an S.O.S
Ay, ay listen to me, to let me, be me

[Hook: T.I. & Chris Brown]
Ay when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm only human y'all
Ay when they push you down you got to get back up, I'm just a human y'all
Push the dirt, off your jersey then go for the cup
Or the trophy, or the ring, champion no matter what
Cause when you got the belt, and the ring
People with you popping bottles, taking pictures, look around
But soon as you fall down all the haters passing judgement, oh no no)
Fly as I'm is shawty I'mma rise above this, oh no no no no

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Hey what it is world? Yeah it's me again
Back before you, at your mercy, on bended knee again
No running from the truth, as much as we pretend
That it ain't what it is, then it hits CNN
Apologies to my fans and my closest friends (I'm sorry)
For letting you down, I won't take you down this road again (uh-uh)
Most of you now saying ""Whatever, here we go again""
Blogs, radio and television all going in
I laugh to keep from crying through all of the embarrassment (I gotta say)
I gotta say you fucking haters is hilarious (ha ha)
How dare you sit right there and act as if you holier than thou?
Point your finger now with me looking down (down)
Same clown that was Twitpicing at my wedding
On the same Twitter page disrespecting, wait a second
Never mind my imperfections, this a fact, remember that
No mistake's too great to recover and bounce back

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I admit, yeah I done some dumb shit, disappointed erry'body I know
Try not to hold that against me though
My road to redemption has no GPS
So guess that time must be invested for this to be manifested
Yes it's, hard living life in the spotlight
Trying to dodge the haters same time as the cop light
The Bible say ""Let he without sin cast the stone first"" (stone first)
The sinner or the one who judged him, who was wrong first?
Yeah he go to work, never done no drugs up until the Fed
He just drink his liquor, touch his kids, beat his wife instead (damn)
Difference is my shortcomings hit the media
Thanks to TMZ, the AJC and Wikipedia
See the stairway to heaven while stepping down Jacob's ladder
My good outweigh the bad, God ain't that what really matter? (nope)
And matter fact, I'm wrong but after that
The good I done in yo' hood, should it over-shadow that?
Got the world laughing at me for the moment
But it gonna be your turn 'fore it's over with, even if you're so legit
That you get a house with a dog and a picket fence
The people with you then but when they turn on you remember this

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is lagging
See me in that new thing, bums is gagging
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been, hang it up, flatscreen
Plasma, ""Hey Nicki, hey Nicki,"" asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencing
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cutting it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fucking with
You lil' brag-a-lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

[Hook: Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Verse 2: Eminem as Slim Shady]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fucking pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering ""Why, God?"" He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones, the world ain’t finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fucking face and called me a fucking tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)

[Hook: Eminem as Slim Shady]
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'mma wrap your coffin with a bow
""Nicki, she's just mad cause you took the spot""
Word, that bitch mad cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shitting, then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear them mumbling, I hear the cackling
I got 'em scared, shook, panicking
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfucking boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas getting buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches calling me Manning Eli
Manning Eli, these bitches calling me Manning Eli!!

[Verse 4: Eminem as Slim Shady]
All you lil' faggots can suck it, no homo
But I'mma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you assdicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash!
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fucking balcony
'fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash, it's (high class) meets (white trash)

Roman, Roman! Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's going on? They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell! I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed! Run along! Let's go! Come on!

It's easy to be Puff, but it's harder to be Sean
What if the twins ask why I ain't marry they mom?

How do I respond?

What if my son stares with a face like my own
And says he wants to be like me when he's grown

And money can't make up for it or conceal it
But you deal with it and you keep ballin'
Pour out some liquor, play boy, and we keep ballin'

I don’t eat sushi, I’m the shit
No, I’m pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater
Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain’t eatin’, fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot ‘em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit, then I’m like, ""¡Olé!""
I don’t care what you say, so don’t even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That’s word to my flag, and my flag red
I’m out of my head, bitch
I’m outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You ain’t hotter than mine, nope
Not on my time, and I’m not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothing, five
And if they trippin’, fuck ‘em, five
I ain’t got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
Cîroc and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy’s dead
You faggots scared ‘cause I’m too wild
Been here for a while, I was like, ""Fuck trial!""
I puts it down, I’m so Young Money
If you got eyes, look at me now, bitch!

Look at me now, look at me now
Oh, I’m gettin' paper

I think I love you
But don't let me get in the way (get in the way)
Don't let me stop you girl
From doing your thing (doing your thing)
Cause I don't deserve you
I don't want to hurt you
Play with your mind
Have you running in circles
Don't let me get in your way (get in your way)

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
It ain't even the puss' I got your mind
It's usually a one way thing but baby girl got mine
Perfection is the formula when me and her combine
Like candy to the corn and yeah your finger-licking fine
In due time I'm sure that I can please you, squeeze you, weak knees you
Need you like you need me, and don't mislead you
Love's free but treat it wrong and pay the price
Get down on one knee, that bitch gon' leave with half your life
Man believe me, I ain't gon' feed you bad advice
Look it's easy, so don't forget to strap up tight
Ride, I'd be selfish if I kept you so
I love you enough to let you go
Cause on the other hand I couldn't take it if I
Put all I got in you and someone got you naked
You work hard for money but it's harder when you make it
These chicks coming fast, here's your heart before I break it; take it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
What type of nigga would I be to hold you up?
You need someone to hold you down and recognize your life's fucked up
I got to shake you out my system
Cause with the fucking and kissing and all your emotions next to me puts me in a tough position
Baby what am I supposed to do?
I can't control my actions when I'm close to you
We been away too long girl we're overdue
I guess the cake ain't enough you want to eat it too
See me and you have a magnet in between that keeps pulling me closer
I'm like an addict for your scream, your fully loaded toast
Automatic with the beam, the baddest on the coast
I got to have you like the green, your swag is more than most
I got a sex drive that won't allow me to lax
Bring on the next five, look how they grind on my lap
Booty, breast, thighs keep your boy relaxed in back
And you deserve way more than that, I'll just fall back

So maybe this is the wrong time

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in
Every day it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
‘Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for ‘em
They just say it's wack
But they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me
I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fighting you, it’s dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
‘Cause me and you were like a crew
I was like your sidekick; you gon' either wanna fight me when I get off this fuckin' mic or you gon' hug me
But I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do, ‘cause…

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle; you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled
‘Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy
Or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me
When everyone was tellin' you don't sign me
Everyone at the fuckin' label; let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake!

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now? Now that I need them
I don't see none of them; all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the crackers' ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards!
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags
And as I’m leavin', I’ll guarantee they'll scream
""Dre, don’t leave us like that, man!"", ‘cause…

Got racks on racks on racks, naps on naps on naps
Just made a mill, count another mill, so put that on top of that
Way back in 2004, I told ‘em it was a wrap
Now my life ain’t my life no more, I told you niggas, a wrap
You claim you a dog, my nigga, I’m the vet

No, not bombs over Baghdad
But on the track you can call me Usain
That’s why they nervous, hmmm, like I’m flying on the plane with a turban
But I’m fly, y’all just turbulence, exit row, emergency (Mayday!)
As a kid, I was struck by lightning, it’s no wonder I’m electrifying
Fuck a brainstorm, I’ll fuck around and cause a power outage
And it ain’t no rivals, if it was, it’d be no survivors
Just gimme a hour, I’ll light it up like an Eiffel Tower

Got pills all on my phone, these niggas know I’m wrong
Said fifty for a song, and they won’t leave me alone

Yeah, riding around with that reefer scent
Riding around with Ms. Reece and them

I’m smoother than alopecia skin
I shows out, like dope when I put that flow down

And all she want is more bags, but all I want is more 1s

The tracks on snack off raps, see stacks from back of my slacks
From X to the max in the Ac, if I ain’t strapped, then the gat’s on scat

Throw sacks on ‘em like y’all hoes, got racks on em like Tahoes

Worldwide, but I got fourth ways, one hat carry like four blades
Petey Pop Off, RIP, free Lou, been lootin’ money since like fourth grade
I’m the shit nowadays, so they wave, no whips, no chains, I’m a slave
Let you niggas know Milita my gang, MCN if you was thinkin’ it’s a game
See me with the twin, buck a shimmy with the gauge
Wasn’t bustin’ Jimmy, I’d be busy gettin’ paid
Goin’ for the grips every day ’til the grave
I be worried about the chips, you be worried about the lays

[Verse 11: Dose]
Got Actavis in my Sprite, Benjamins in my Robins

In the fast lane, gettin’ slow brain in a 2012 Maserati

Puffin’ on that garlic, cigar full of Marley
Inked up on my hands and arms, got them jams in my pocket
Shout out to Sha Money, signed me in a hurry
Daddy was a kingpin, a couple milli buried

Check my bank account, got racks on racks

Platinum and gold, you gots to love that
Posted up just like a thumbtack
Better hide ya ho, ’cause she bound to get snatched
H-Town, Texas to ATL
She got a fat ass, she prolly know me well
Keep it on the low, never kiss and tell

Locked up for double life like “What the hell?”

Down through the Dirty, back up through the trap
But the money don’t stack, man money overlap
Yeah, y’all better watch it, mayne, right here we lock and load
Two things is for certain, mayne and one thing is fa sho’
Got a house on hundred acres
I’ve never seen my neighbors

Police on your mama phone, talking bout your baby gone
Tell the truth, I ain’t gon’ lie, I got so many rides
Don’t know which one I’ma drive, fuck it, I’m just gone fly

[Verse 14: Twista]
Everybody wanna hate because I’m on
Blowing head back, bottles by the zone
Twista finna get up on the track
And spit it the way I do simp-a-ly because I like this song
When I step up out the Maserati car
Gotta pull it, pull it, pull it, pull it from the jar
Then I blow, I’ma close out the par
Wit’ some killers and everybody know who we are
Get Money Gang stepping through the door, Chi-cago, cago, cago
Anybody wanna get into it, come on
And do it, for security, we gon’ make a pit a flow
Might as well get it off yo’ chest
While everybody got ammunition on deck
I don’t see them T-Dum-Izzle as a threat
Cause I got racks on racks on racks
Oh, Twista, I see your future, finna shoot ya
I salute you if you could get at the general in military
Racks and racks and tracks and stacks and gats
I could destroy an entire village when I kill and bury
‘Cause I manipulate your molecular structure
Other words, fill ‘em up wit’ holes
If you try to give it to me at the door
I just thought I had to let you know

[Verse 15: Big Sean]
(I bet your bitch call me Big)

Man, that’s racks on racks on racks on top of packs on top of pounds
My chains is pow on pow on pow
I’m off them trees, no I ain't no owl
I’m at the altar sayin’ my vows, to this Benjamin Franklin pile
You buy her a house, I won’t buy her a vowel
You fell in love and I fell in her mouth
Then called her Dickface, she call the connect
You call her collect, I call to collect, no need for a pet
If I throw this paper, your bitch gon’ fetch
Do it, B-i-g
And Detroit gonna be aight as long as we got me

[Verse 16: Trae The Truth]
I’m in the hood if you wonder where I’m at
In the back of a Chevy that’s all black
Racks on racks, I don’t know how to act
Track and field with the birds, I’m running em like track
Free throws of money, bet you can’t block
King of the club, I bet you can’t top
Bitch niggas hate the fact I get guap
Or the fact when the money go up, it won’t stop
I’m in the club, tryna show ‘em how to stunt
Tryna pick up what I’m throwing, it prolly take em bout a month
The club underwater, have em running out the front
While I’m somewhere in the back, getting blowed like a blunt
No need to trip, you can tell em that I’m cool as hell
‘Cause that’s the case I'm known to pack a tool as well
I’m a blood motherfucker, nothing new to tell
Got Vogues underneath the old-school as well
I got lights on my wrist that’ll flash like cop
Couple of foreign cars that I ride, no top
Couple of wet whips that I ride like yachts
A couple of haters looking, I’m knowing them niggas hot
And tell ‘em that I don’t give a damn
Hard as a motherfucker, tell em I was HAM
Call it what you want, I’ma do it for the fam
Yeah, that’s the type of nigga that I am

[Verse 17: Ace Hood]
Okay, I’m back off into this bitch
With a cup, and it’s full of that liq
Got racks, ain’t talking tits
Big stacks, no Lego bricks
Hit a trick and fiending nigga got it
I keep that hottie, just look at her body
Blew twenty bands in that King of Diamonds
Sorry, that’s just part of my hobby
And I hear em feeling my Florida swagger
So dope, shit, I sold y’all copies
That ice be onto my neck and wrist
Mow anybody wanna play some hockey
I’m that nigga in fact, paper tall as Shaq
Blood, Sweat, and Tears, it’ll be on your local Walmart rack, soon

You don't have to work, and I can get you anythin' you want
I could, I could, I could, I could put you on
See, you look like Beyoncé, so do it like Beyon
Do it like Beyoncé, and put it on Sean
Grind hard, but I got a lot to show for it
Always had drive, like I had to chauffeur it

To follow us around and make a show for us

And I'ma make it last, like it's my last
And I'm gone, can't remember where I am
But she forget about her man when they tell her who I am
And they introduce my fan, now she all up in my space
All, all up in my face, like, ""You remember who I am?""
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louis Vuitton Sean
Up in Benny Han Han eatin' all the Wonton
Rosé rose over a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants, now she rockin' Sean john
Man, I just ended up on everybody guest list
I'm just doin' better than what everyone projected
I knew that I'd be here, so if you asked me how I feel
I'ma just tell you, it's everythin' that I expected, bitch

Radio contact has been attempted but cannot be established Instructions are to prepare for an attack by an unknown enemy

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Fo’ fo’ bulldog: my motherfucking pet
I point it at you and tell that motherfucker ""fetch""
I’m fucking her good, she got her legs on my neck
I get pussy, mouth and ass, call that bitch triple threat
When I was in jail she let me call her collect
But if she get greedy, I’ma starve her to death
Top down, it’s upset
Been fucking the world and nigga I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch I got my hand up her dress
The money don’t sleep, so Weezy can’t rest
And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh

I’m not a star, somebody lied, I got a chopper in the car
I got a chopper in the car, I got a chopper in the car
Load up the choppers like it’s December 31st

If I die today, remember me like John Lennon
Buried in Louis, I’m talking all brown linen, huh

Big black nigga in a icey watch
Shoes on the coupe, bitch I got a Nike shop
Count the profits you could bring 'em in a Nike box
Grinding in my Jordans kick 'em off they might be hot, swish!
I’m swimming in a yellow bitch in the red 911 looking devilish
Red beam make a bitch nigga sit down

Drop palmolive in a nigga dope
Make it come back even harder than before
Baby I’m the only one that paid your car notes
Well connected got killers off in Chicago

A million miles away
A message to the main
Ooooh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I’m on my way

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Let's go
Yeah
You’re listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man I’m like a young gun fully black Barack
I cried tear drops over the Massive Attack
I only make hits like I work with a racket and bat
Look at my jacket and hat
So damn berserk
So down to earth
I’m bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major, I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look, I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
Where the hell's all the sanity at, damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, I needed a change
When we ate we never tipped because we needed the change
I needed a break
For a sec I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say that money is the root to the evilist ways
But have you ever been so hungry it keeps you awake
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed
Great, it feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream, I tried to chase it
But I wasn’t going nowhere, running man!
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Trying to change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta keep screaming until they hear you out

I’m a made nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused might as well say ""cheese"" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sell out, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration bitches Mazeltov
It’s a slim chance I fall, Olive Oyl
Tunechi be the name, don’t ask me how I got it
I’m killin’ these hoes I swear I’m tryna stop the violence

[Hook: Drake]
All I care about is money an' the city that I'm from
I'mma sip until I feel it, I'mma smoke it 'til it's done
And I don’t really give a fuck, and my excuse is that I’m young
And I’m only getting older, somebody shoulda told ya
I’m on one, yeah, fuck it I’m on one
Yeah, I said ""I’m on one"", fuck it I’m on one
Two white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and Imma get that shit
Cause I’m on one, I said ""fuck it, I’m on one""

[Verse 1: Eminem]
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin’
Fighters keep fightin’, put your lighters up!
Point them skyward, uh!
Had a dream I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game’s nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin’ feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I’ll be the fuckin’ illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I’m refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up’s using, no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I’m a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin’ shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite
You stayed the same
‘Cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!
I love it when I tell them shove it, ‘cause it wasn’t that
Long ago when Marshall sat flustered, lacked luster
‘Cause he couldn’t cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy ‘cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
Circling around his head waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
What difference it make?
What’s it take to get it through your thick skulls
That this ain’t some bullshit
People don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage
And let it be known from this day forward

And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him

Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back

Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up

Always down for the catchweight, like Pacquiao

And y'all niggas that's gossiping like bitches

Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag

[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, because…

[Hook]
This one's for you and me
Living out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters

[Intro: Chris Richardson]
Walk a thousand miles
Just to see her (see her)

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Sittin’ on a plane
Reminscing back when I made that mistake
I wish it never ended with a heartbreak
Now your heart broken, tears in ya face
Ask myself why, looking at the sky
If I could turn back I’d make it all right
Praying that you better but its still stormy weather
Don’t wanna let go but the rain won't let up
Now you gone, still thinking bout you everyday
And I know feelings was hurt and you can blame me but
I’m sorry for the games that I played
But now it’s too late
And now she’s…

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Verse 2: Tyga]
It’s cold putting up a fight
Arguing back and forth through the night
Regardless what I said I don’t mean most of it
You know I really love you, this the realest goin’ get
It take time to realize what you really wanna know
You was ready for it all but your feelings I ignored
I know my fault, I should’ve gave more
Now you’re miles away and I’m miles on tour
Now it’s drums playing, crowd singing
Life changing, wish you was here to witness all
Now that starts fading
They say two wrongs don’t make it right
And I was wrong and now it ain't right

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Bridge: Tyga + Chris Richardson]
Na na na nah
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
I’d do just that
If I could make it right
I’d do it all tonight
Hold you in my arms, with you I’d spend my life
Na na na nah
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
I’d do just that
I’d do just that
If I could turn back
(Come back here again)

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

(Far, far away)
If I could turn back

I’d do it all tonight
Hold you in my arms, with you I’d spend my life

Of course you welcome girl, you ain't taking up space
We get there, shawty still looking right
She attacked me, but wait, let me dim the lights

So G.O.O.D. she won't put my tattoo on it
Bottom line is, you the finest
Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that?) My bitch
Hold up, hold up, whoa there, let's capture this moment
If I hit it then I own it, marijuanin' every mornin

You should just go and throw a cape on
And it’s just so amazing

[Intro: Otis Redding (Jay Z)]
It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their whole happiness
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her
(Sounds so soulful, don’t you agree?)

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
I invented swag
Poppin bottles, putting supermodels in the cab
Proof
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert: Hublots
Or the big face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snap back, see my cut through the holes

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Damn, Yeezy and Hov, where the hell ya been?
Niggas talking real reckless; stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond them
Now I’m about to make them tuck their whole summer in
They say I’m crazy, but I’m about to go dumb again
They ain't seen me cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week I was in my other other Benz
Throw your diamonds up cause we in this bitch another 'gain

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth
I’m 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
Flee in the G450 I might surface
Political refugee, asylum can be purchased
Everything's for sale
I got 5 passports, I’m never going to jail

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I made Jesus Walks, I'm never going to hell
Couture level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive
I get it custom, you a customer
You ain't accustomed to going through customs
You ain't been nowhere, hah?
And all the ladies in the house got them showing off
I’m done I'll hit you up maña...nah!

Welcome to Havana
Smoking Cubana’s with Castro in cabanas
Viva Mexico, Cubano
Dominicano, all the plugs that I know
Driving Benzes with no benefits
Not bad, huh, for some immigrants?
Build your fences, we digging tunnels
Can’t you see we gettin money up under you?

[Verse 6: Kanye West]
Can’t you see the private jets flying over you?
Maybach bumper sticker reads: ""What would Hova do?""
Jay is chillin', Ye is chillin'
What more can I say? We killin' 'em
Hold up before we end this campaign
As you can see we done bodied the damn lames
Lord please let them accept the things they can't change
And pray that all of their pain be champagne

Say ya miss me and ya wishing for some private time girl how could we get that way?

[Verse 1: Wale]
Look, another day another dollar
She hate me when I leave cuz when I leave I never call her
That's life shit alright, shit, I could call you right quick
But if I call you gone be like ""Boo why we haven't skyped yet?""
And on Skype bet you say ""Le where my flight at?"", if I decline
Then you inquire on where I spend my nights at
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more then hectic
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
Just look closer my life is quite deceptive
Women'll sell they soul just to buy some attention
I need something to hold fuck that passive aggression
And when im back from off that road dont ask me no questions... please.. fear watchu dont know

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Don't remember how I met her but I know I won't forget her
And If loving her is wrong then I just know I won't see heaven
She say she from Seattle, she twenty and some change
Before I get to T.I.A. I'm sure to make her rain
Then I'm back up on my plane Chi-town O'Hare
We spend some time and get some wine have some milds from Harold's
I told her this here's overrated but I love your city baby
Gotta get back to the D, you know we finally famous
Driver drop me off at Dulles im headed to some money
TSA be laughing all them rubbers in your luggage
I know ima always leave em but I swear ill always love em
Tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another

Asked her what she’s think, she replied that I'm a beast
Yeah, she replied that I'm a beast
Got it locked between the sheets and even in the streets

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Baby, you don’t have to try to read my mind
'Cause you know I wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about it?
If you want it, then I got it
We can be body to body, body to body
I don’t mean to rush you, girl
But we should be body to body
Body to body, body to body

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
We're making love on the floor, you're kissing my tattoos
I'm pulling your hair, you scream my name, call me daddy, baby, I got you
Girl, get in your bed and lay it down, down, down, girl, are you ready?
'Cause I'm gon' want you face down, down, down, right now, you fucking with a real freak

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Baby, you don’t have to try to read my mind
'Cause you know I wanna get it in
And tell me why would we just think about it?
If you want it, then I got it
We can be body to body, body to body
I don’t mean to rush you, girl
But we should be body to body
Body to body, body to body

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga!""
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighing sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around, like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me; nose-bleed seats
And today I went shopping and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fucking game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fucking game right now, she will

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me!""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still looking for me
And you could take it to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry, like a towel rack
I'm all about ""I"", give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry; call that ""wine and dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checking pulses
They say ""choose wisely"", that's why I was chosen
Rocking like the asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl's face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fucking game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fucking game right now, she will

And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fucking game right now, she will

Uh, it's Diggy
Queens, you with me
Yeah, let's get it, let's get it
G-g-g-g go

[Verse 1]
Check my million-dollar swag
I tell em 10-4 cause they wanna copy that
Uh, in the mall, lotta shopping bags
Baby girl what you want, your boy got the tab
If your man say where you at
I'mma tell him I ain't seen her
Better hit her on the jack
She's gone for the evening
I make em lean back, Don Cartegena
You know what's up Martin, Tom, and Gina
I'm the lead-off like Derek Jeter
They copy my demeanor
They be rocking
I know they watching
They act like I don't see em

[Hook]
Yeah I'll never stop
Keep me on my job and
They be tryna copy and paste me
Copy and paste me
I'm on, and I be in my zone
And they be tryna copy and paste me

[Verse 2]
Peep my shoe game

Look like they got spots on her
My ratings is up cause everybody's watching it
I be V.I.P. you in line where the rope is
Don't come any closer, you might step on my Cultures
Ladies it's your jam leave your jacket on the sofa
Have a little class, put your glass up on a coaster
Get up on the floor shake it shake like you're supposed to
If you know getting over tell them copy, copy, over

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Copy paste
Copy copy, paste

I need me a queen, I need me a dime
Living this fast life: just show me a sign

Took her from the lame, put her on that condo on the beach
All she needs, all-all-all she needs
Is a boss on my level who provides every need
All I fiend is a queen in my presence

Couple G's in my bezel

Stunning in the snow, these haters they can go somewhere

A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?

Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I’m fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch

And we way too young to know love, maybe not but we don't need no rush
Don't believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first huh
Can I be with you just one night, I could wear you out inside
I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tri's
I just think we need one night, can't decide if I came right
Easy baby my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain't right
I ain't thinking I ain't right, can't decide but I can't fight
Easy baby. You the bomb and all, but I be damned if I do not land mine
Or at least try, can I speak up? was it peace out? can we eat lunch?
Can we take shots? What's your flavor? Flat drinks we call A cups

And I'm at the bar nine shots no fifty
'Bout to bring a hundred more

They say I'm a celebrity, what the fuck's a celebrity?
I guess I must invest in the proper form of protection
And I say it's a curse, but it's been mostly a blessin'
To a nigga from the hood
Tryin' to aim for the top, I didn't even need no directions
I just wake up then I roll up the purp

Lean you to ya side yeah and ask ya who’s ya daddy now
Ain't even gotta open your eyes, know what your looking at
And I ain't even have to open my eyes when I was cooking that
Guess it was love at first sight, eye contact
Remember the night we first met, I caught a contact
Now she's my ride or die, it’s us against the world
You know we both hustlin’ so hustlin’ is our world
Said I must've had too much to drink I’m in my G-Mode
So all the ladies repeat after me cause it’s the G-Code
Promise if I get locked, you’ll come and pay my bond

But I walk down this aisle faithfully, cut that cake for me
I, Jay-Z, take this unlawful lady to have and to hold
And til the task force roll
To hug her every corner til I get ash from the cold
Or until I’ve amassed a fortune, too much cash for me to fold(fold)
Fold under pressure I would never, ever, ever, ever(ever)

You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart

En Cuba, la cosa esta dura, but the women get down if you know what I mean
In Columbia the women got everything on, some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil they freaky with big ol' boobs and they thongs, blue yellow and green
En L.A. tengo la Mexicana
En New York tengo la boricua
Besitos para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah
Y en Miami tengo a cualquiera

You put it down like New York City, I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy
Hotter than Miami, I feel the heat
Oh, Miss International love, oh, Miss International love

There’s not a place that your love don’t affect me baby
So don’t ever change
I crossed the globe when I'm with you baby
Ay, woah-oh

You don't know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way

Look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied

Through my rise and fall, you've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talking to each other again

I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain

Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my mama smile that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message coulda been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the..

Murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up
Charity work, parking tickets and no charges
Fuck nigga you fucked over your father when he gave you a dick
Should have been a bitch in pajamas
I made my first million fucking dollars
Bought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me
Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and a binocular
I'm scared, this shit don't happen to everybody

The bread, now a nigga run the game boy

No pain, no gain, it’s embedded in the brain
I’m in it for the grip, motherfuck the fame

Don't make it slam on you like Amar'e

Oops, that's your baby, my bad, I'm sorry

Keep your stomach and your thighs and your legs right
While I’m out here focus getting this bread right
But if the head right, Jeezy there every night
Wake up in the morning and I'm still here
Wake up in the morning and I ain’t gone
All I ask, let me just do me
And maybe just me and you can get along
Had them other bitches mad when they seen us
Had them matching rolexes baby, team us
Yeah the earth is our turf we can share the world
Maybe even go half on a baby girl

[Hook]

Yeah

You ain't no good (no good)

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]

Let me be your mind reader, let me read your mind
And when I’m done with the front, hit it from behind
Love a loyalty never cross the line
Just hit a nigga up when I cross your mind
Show you how to get you on you won’t be watching mine
? show you how to shine
And maybe we can kick it when I got the time
Be my back bone every nigga need a spine
Gotta know you ride with me if I’m right or wrong
Case I wake up in the morning and it’s all gone
Best believe I’ma get it right back
Thats the hustler in me I know you like that
You probably think I’m with a different broad every night
When I think about it shit man you’re probably right
The more I think about it shit you’re probably wrong
Cause what you didn’t think about is that I'm probably grown

[Verse 3: Ne-Yo]

She said she wish she never met me
Cause she just can't help her let me go ahead
And do whatever the hell I want
She said she hate how much she need me
Turn around, and say she don’t need me
Always talking about she gonna leave me
But she don’t
But maybe this time might be different
Cause she shed so many tears
She’ll remind me all the dumb shit that I’ve done over the years
But she don’t be tripping in the morning, I got her legs up by her ears
But as soon as we get done, I swear this is all I hear, yeah

Damn, life's so short
Fuck it, I don't wanna go to court
Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer, though
Fuck it, I’m on the run for the money
I’m in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil niggas thuggin’, even got me paranoid
I’m gettin' money, that's in any nigga category
Double M, I got G’s out in California

[Verse 2: Drake]
It bothers me when the gods get to actin' like the broads
Guess every team doesn’t come complete
With niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y’all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don’t be duckin' like you never wanted nothin'
It's feelin' like rap changed, it was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from DC, that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million-dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North, that's how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty M’s
Kobe my nigga, I hate it had to be him
Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym
(Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym)
Tell Lucian I said ""fuck it,"" I’m tearin' holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix, and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet, told 'em: ""Butterfly it, she’ll love it.""
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'
I'm just hittin' my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fuckin' finish line; we can’t wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that
Young rich motherfucker gettin' mine off rap, with my niggas

[Hook: Rick Ross + French Montana]
I ride for my niggas, dawg
I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas, dawg
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg
I ride for my niggas

[Verse 3: French Montana]
From the hoopty coupe to that Ghost, dawg
Pigeons on the roof like Ghost Dog
Dwight Howard on the post, dawg
My niggas got the powder through the post, dawg
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head
Niggas lost mill's tryna beat the feds
Ten grams off my last 250 now
Big ass crib, 250 down, damn!
Gave my nigga Max 7-5
Then gave my nigga Penthouse another 30
Fuck it, got me thinkin' like I'm 7-5
Damn, nigga ain't even seen 30

Party going wild, fist pumping music

Almost dared the right five
Ready to get live
Ain't no surprise
Take me so high
Jump and nose dive
Surfing the crowd

Said I gotta be the man
I'm the head of my band
Mic check one two-oooh
Shut 'em down in the club while the playboy does
And they all get loose, loose
After bottle, we all get bent then again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto
Club shut down: a hundred super models

Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off
Then I make that move
Somehow, some way, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Uh-oh, it's on like everything goes
Wild out baby, 'til the freak, it shows
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show
I like 'em untamed, don't tell me high pain
Tolerance, bottoms up when the champagne
My life, call my hanna to be explain
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane

A side you would never thought you would see
Tear up that body
Dominate you 'til you've had enough

Got me quite open for a while

And I like my marijuana bright
And I like my window tinted out
Shout out them strippers who hustle
Get yours; you know what this about

Shorty wanna fuck me, I say get on top and roller coast
And I lay back, she go cray, fuck me good, but she no stay
Murder on that pussy let her boyfriend get that DOA
Get it? And all I get is Frito Lay
Plus I'm on probation, when they test me I just pee Rosé
Cause last night, I went hard, Peach Ciroc, Patron and all
Thirty racks on magnum bottles, I think I was born to ball
Lookin' like a million plus, fresh I'm out that corner store
Hater I be doin' me, you guys should be doin' y'all

For niggas jumping the fence I hope you niggas can float
And I just hope that I'm forgiven for carin' 'bout how they livin'
And loanin a little money and keepin' 'em out of prison
I ain't lyin' in my verses I'm just telling you the basics
Of growin' up with your friends and becoming the one that made it
Yes lord! All gold, man I got these bitches soul
Talking bout these other rappers getting old is even getting old
Worrying about your followers, you need to get your dollars up
Me and Meek, young niggas poppin' like our collars up
And good ain't good enough, and your hood ain't hood enough
Spent my whole life putting on, you spend your whole life putting up

She got that million dollar body, shorty my Bugatti
And she said she got a man, we keep it secret Illuminati

Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
All these chicks popping pussies, I’m just popping bandz
Bandz a make her dance, bandz a make her dance
These chicks clappin’, and they ain’t using hands

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Short hair, like Nia Long, loose ones, she don’t need a loan
Start twerking when she hear her song, stripper pole her income
We get trippy and then some. So nasty when she rollin’
She put that ass up in my hands, I remote control it (Yeah ho)
She give me dome when the roof gone, at the K.O.D. she leave with me
She got friends, bring three. I got drugs, I got drinks
Bend it over, Juicy J gon' poke it like wet paint
You say no to ratchet pussy, Juicy J can't
Racks everywhere, they showin' racks, I'm throwing racks
In the V.I.P, rubber on I’m stretching that
Rich niggas tippin', broke niggas lookin'
And it ain't a strip club if they ain't showin' pussy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
(... Baby...ha ha ah... Juicy I got ya)
(UGH)
Pop that pussy for a real nigga
Pull out my black card, that's my lil' nigga
Make a movie with your bitch, Steven Spiel nigga
Smoking on Keysh, Cole, gimme me chills nigga
What's your real name? And not your stripper name
I make it rain on ya, like a windowpane
Bandz a make her dance, Tunechi make her cum
Hit-it-from-the-side-like-a-mother-fucking-bass-drum
Two hoes on one fucking pole, two hoes on my fucking pole
I don't tip, I pay bills, bitches call me Buffalo
Her stomach in and her ass out
I'm flyer than the ones they pass out
If money grow on trees, I branched out
I'm just waiting on my bitch to cash out (Ha ha)

If yo girl don't swallow kids, man, that ho basic
Got 2 bitches wit me: take a shot of one ho, using her friend for a chaser
Bandz a make her bust it, let me see you touch it
Money talk, you ain't got none, end of discussion
(Bandz a make her do it, pocket full of money
Young nigga gettin' head while the engine runnin'
Let me see you wiggle, do it for a real nigga

Diced pineapple
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but I'm kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya
I'm tryin to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I ain't talking about no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna, give you whats better than better
The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or temporary forevers
Shorty get it together
Diced pineapple
May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay 'till you need five and
Tell me shorty you got it baby
If its not it baby, hope its progress baby
Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby, no more talking baby

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples damn my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh uhh
Sex all night, couple shots of Ciroc
Crib on the water, got LeBron up the block
Money ain't the thing baby, welcome to the mob
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sing
Her uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team
Double MG them other niggas fell off
Baby girl I just wanna see you well off

[Hook: Drake]
Call me crazy -- shit, at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out don't it girl

Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples I just bought my girl a set
I know my lifestyle wild I do it for the set
She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex
Pop bottles, make love, thug passion
Red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion
Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated
Balmain, rich denim, out Vegas
French Riviera baby girl lets take a trip
I'mma trip go to Cannes, France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing
And with your permission hopefully you'll learn a lesson

Something about her probably can't live without her
Roll up some sour, let me kiss on a fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won’t ever rest, we meet at the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Agent Provocateur
Rushing you out your drawers though patiently get you off
Hate when they be too anxious though, hate when they be too dull
Like to go deep but I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you, let me see, show me proof
Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is we, we don’t need no room
Right now I’m trying eat, we don’t need a spoon

So I better come with it, then I better come spilt it
And I can admit that I’m feeling a little pressure
When you’re telling me I better come get it
But I’m the man for the job
Can’t nobody do it quite like I do
And the same go for you

And really you don’t need to walk me through it
But you can talk me through it
What I’m asking if it’s mine
Cause I'mma be your motivation
Just tryina see if you can break my fucking spine
I’m so attracted, to the way you carry yourself
And keep your composure
You a lady in the street
But behind closed doors you’re a fucking soldier
A brother would never know
That’s how you like it ha
But that booty pack a mean punch
And I’ma spike it, huh

You’re incredible, edible, unforgettable
Body is so angelical, the rebel with a cause
Speaking in hypotheticals
Could I marry you if I wanted to
I’ll take you how you coming
Just learn to live with your flaws
Even though it’s not that many
You give me that good and plenty
Then I walk around all day grinning

Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume, go, go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance, hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is, a little bit hmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, P.S

With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taking clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but Goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want

And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words, they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you looking in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you looking for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steering, sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, uh-huh
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly and right before you go blind, P.S

You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want

Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from
AK's, AR's, ""Aye y'all, duck""
That's what momma said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess, m.A.A.d city

[Hook]
""Man down, where you from, nigga?""
""Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?""
""Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?""
""This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga""

[Bridge]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear

[ScHoolBoy Q]
""YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!""

[Part 2: Produced by Terrace Martin]

[Intro: MC Eiht]
Wake your punk ass up! It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. Real simple and plain, I'mma teach you some lessons about the street. Hood. It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. How we do

[Verse 2]
Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking, the next weekend, we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick, A.K.A. ""Compton's human sacrifice""

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed. Niggas been mixing shit since the 80's, loc. Sherm sticks, butt nakeds. Dip, make a nigga flip. Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit. One time's crooked and shit. Block a nigga in. Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of IVs with the fucking spray-can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grands where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4]
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor, instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage, kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizing
The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim
And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what

[Scratches]
M.A.A.d city
Compton

[Skit]
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn! You ain't the one that got fucked up, what you holding it for? Niggas always acting unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up! Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga? Don't even trip, just lay back and drink that

Already changed the game once I done told you

Living my life about peace

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
The wound heals but it never does
That’s cause you’re at war with love
You're at war with love, yeah

[Hook: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruin's wooing me
Arrow holes that never close from Cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid cause I know it ain't no you and me
But when you're trying to beat the odds up
Been trying to keep your nods up and you know that you should know
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding on another lover's phone sends you back into the zone
With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle
Maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

[Pre-Hook: Guy Sebastian]
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
Cause I’m the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
Cause it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over

[Hook: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
(And just leave then)
You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground screaming medic
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses
Shields, body armors and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win

[Pre-Hook 2: Guy Sebastian]
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop cause it hurts so much
Cause I’m the only one that's trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
Cause it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over

[Hook: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Bridge: Guy Sebastian & Lupe Fiasco]
Cause you've set me on fire
I’ve never felt so alive, yeah
No, hoping wounds heal, but it never does
That's because you're at war with love
And I’m at the point of breaking
And it’s impossible to shake it

[Pre-Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
See, you hoped the wound heals, but it never does
That's cause you're at war with love
Hope it heals, but it never does
That's cause you're at war with love!

These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading
Don’t look like they’re ever going away

Don’t look like they’re ever going away

Feeling like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetary with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinking 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar-
Dee, probably selling D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off, in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, ""DOO DOO!"" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, ""Mmm mmm,""
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP, I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must've froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talking to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach it only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter, any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park dirt ditch diggin'
Burger flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginning again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? GREAT. Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up, wait, no I don't give a
Flying duck, nothing but a buckshot, Ch, pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show, Yelawolf

[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, stretch from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that ""suck my cock"" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should've stayed with me, now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the morning on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinking Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scrambling, selling Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I’ve got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I’m a free man, try not to eat ham

[Verse 7: Big KRIT]
Big KRIT, shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'Lac with flats
After that, bottles I can’t pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love, all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I’ve been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I’m taxing if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er, nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin’ grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my sub, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hoping the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you’ll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, popping benji tags on your wifey’s ass
That’s out of line, but in living color?
I’m more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers, a true artist

Still pop ace king shit I'm with Rozay
Black Maybach leather gloves on that OJ
OK the day you beating me bitch no day
Bandz a make her dance that's thousand dollar foreplay

You kissed her in her mouth, ask her how my dick taste
Bitch nigga you don't want no drama, I'm worth a couple commas

Last King come sign up, all my shit be designer
Extroardinary rhymer I bodied yo' shit for nothin'

New chick just to drag my mink
New car just to ride 'round here

Hating on hood niggas dying 'round here
Bath Salt Boss, got insurance on the beard
Cars rockstars, dope boys at odds

Hands clap like a nigga in the stadium
Million dollar chain but I'm rocking 8 of 'em
I see you slipping boy don't make me pick your label up
Scottie Pippen on the dribble I just laid 'em up
Another triple got me tripping like it's angel dust

Bitch I'm the bomb call me the unabomber

I'm feeling like a man of the hour, tear down the house
Throwin' this money like it's no running out
Okay, but I wanna know, can you get any higher?
And drop it down the pole like it's a fire
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I'm feeling like the man of the hour, host of the evening

Looking up in the sky I say I love watching you elevate
Get high as you ever been (go), we getting hella bent (go)
Ball so hard, I deserve me a letterman
Now then let me see that cake, cake, cake, like Entenmann's
Ass up, gon' take it down like a sedative

Better get familiar like a motherfuckin' relative
Know you see the fireworks, you looking where my section is
All this money falling in the air like it's confetti, bitch

[Verse 2: Wale]
Uhh, Wale though, uh...
I'm the man of the hour, money and power
And the humble ain't feed me so I got that Geechi shit out me
And the city is ours where the killers devour
Where the niggas lift ""Smith-And""s
And the victims lift a few flowers
Okay what I see dog you and me not cool
Bet they be loud when I leave out room
Knowing how you move how you got good shoes
When the heat on niggas be like pyoom
Young nigga with some old riches
And the coldest women I be with weave on Necole Bitchie's
The broad let me I sweat it out like P90 get me doe
And I'm sure she's got them cakes but I'm trying to see that throat

Got more bottles than homies, it's a movie, ready for the show

Reporting live from the tallest building in Tokyo
Long ways from them hard ways
Bills and Os, and oh-yays
Dade County always, 305 all day
Now, baby, we can parler, or, baby, we can party
She read books, especially about red rooms and tie ups
I got it hooked, ‘cause she seen me in a suit
With the red tie tied up
Meet in Greece, nice to meet ya
But time is money, only difference is I own it
Now let's stop time and enjoy this moment

I see the future but live for the moment
Make sense, don't it?
Now make dollars, I mean billions
I'm a genius, I mean brilliant
This street is what schooled him
And made him slicker, to slick with the ruler
I've lost a lot, and learned a lot
But I'm still undefeated, like Shula
I'm far from cheap
I break down companies with all my peeps
Baby, we can travel the world
And what I can give you is all you can see
Time is money, only difference is I own it
Like a stop watch
Let's stop time and enjoy this moment

Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd; totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I fill on you, I'm sayin'...

Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me 20 dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game, like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together!
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but...

She ain’t got a leg to stand on
Don’t even trip

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
I can take you all over the world though
Even tell you pack light
The last slide couldn’t even get a cab ride
She don’t do the blogs, but if she did, she’d be on mad sites
Ass so mean that I’m always on her bad side
Uh, now she don’t ever stress me ’bout my whereabouts
Never seems concerned
With other birds that she may hear about
She mind hers, since mine's hers
That shit she barely care about
Look amazing on me, why I’m always tryna wear her out
She don’t ride like you, no, she don’t taste like that
Not with a waist like that, do I let her go to waste like that?
She a mix between Kama Sutra, yoga and porno flicks
Funny how her breath get shorter when I give her long dick
Uh, and I’m telling y’all straight up
Might think I imagined shorty even when she not made-up
She kill ‘em in Levi’s, see why? It ain’t even fair
Look good in whatever she wear
How could other women compare? They can’t

But you know love is nothing; ask Stan Smith
But I gotta keep a bad bitch, like Brad Pitt
Remember our first kiss? Or our last kiss?
I used to go dummy in that pussy; crash test
You be fuckin' that nigga like you was fucking me?
Ha, fuck that nigga! He can’t fuck with me
I’m Tunechi, bitch, and you know that
And that pussy throw back
But any given night, I’d still pop that ass, like a Prozac
Girl, you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla
And every time we cut, I used to shred her; Ninja Turtles
And I know you still love me, and I know you still for me
That’s why we still fuckin'

Still nothing else even matters
Can’t even walk slow through that mall
‘Cause paparazzi running after
Baby girl working it like a pro, slow it down or move it faster
Whether them lights on or them lights off
Like I’m sleeping with the clapper
Say she watching what she eat, yet that ass keep getting fatter
How I’m sexing her
Makes that ex of hers no longer be a factor
Plus her and I already know, you done turn them all to Casper
Climb with the former rather latter
You already know which one I’d rather cum on

And the hood girls want a smart nigga

I ain't bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (bad, nooo)

Rough sex, sayin' I love ya
But to kiss them is sayin' you mean that (bad, nooo)
I know, I just be callin' her mean-ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is probably a deep past
Still I'm feelin' of somethin' I need bad
Thinkin' if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by goin' between legs
Beg? Nope—bed, floor, dope; go for it, couch now
Slow motion around, put it down
Lord knows she was gone ‘fore the morn', hold up

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
(Yeah, let me tell you 'bout her, look!)

[Verse 2: Wale]
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride in goin' out
And gettin' hollered at, and sayin' nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make up by the boatload
Ridin' through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much, but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you're winter-time cold, shawty, fall through
Baby, look at they approach, how they court you
All those minds games
Nevermind, 'cause they all lose (Bad, nooo)
In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you suckin' your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble yo' mean-ass
Look, shawty is actually in prevent
'Cause the one in front of her is workin' with deep threat
Yep—bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm, done
Love? Nah, called in the morn'
Cell number wasn't on, goddamn!

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it

Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whoop a Maserati, pulling up a donk

Pop a ace of spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
Keep a young nigga workin' gotta buss a cape

I'd rather pop an ollie, and my dick is a trolley
Boy, I'll bury you like Halle
And these hoes say I'm blind
Cause I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Man I just received a package

And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
And he already home and that nigga must be snitchin'
Cut him off like karate!

He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
5-year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, ""What about them niggas?"" She say, ""What about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in

Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself

They throw dirt on my name
Well, that's why they still dig me
And I'm tired of all this hatin'
I thank God for my patience
I thank God for my homies
I wish we could trade places
Bitch, we good-fellas
Boy, all them niggas with you, they just pall bearers
And if we ball, catch us
Remember sip slow, live fast
Young Money, stay young
I been Cash Money since day one (Tunechi!)

[Hook: Drake]
No new friends, no new friends
No new friends, no, no new
Still here with my day one niggas
So you hear me say no new friends
No new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I still ride with my day one niggas
I don't really need no new friends
No new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I stay down from day one, so I say
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
One more time
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas, stay down from day one, so I say

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Aye, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kind of slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger-fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She wanted to hang with us, we wanted one thang
Just penetratin' that throat, dawg
She choked on it like smoke, dawg
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefer
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can page to put a ""69""
And I know it time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
""Why you always give your ass up?
I mean, damn, these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid—this shit don't add up.""
She said, ""Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
And then never call back, I still fuck.""
And that's fucked up, she's so trill
I need somethin', she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds 'til it goes down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
I won't say her name, ‘cause she married now

[Hook: Kris Stephens]
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
She would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watchin' just to see if the police comin'
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was goin' back and forth with each flight
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her: ""Hurry up, meet me at the room!""
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
What my common sense neglected
And two months later, next thing I know
I got a text that said ""I'm pregnant""
And you can almost bet she kept it
And that's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested—damn!

[Hook: Kris Stephens]
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Wait, hold up, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 305 had gave me high five
When I said I’m in hot pursuit
You said I won’t ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv
But no freestyle I never do
You lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlookin' every nigga that ain’t quite ready
To make it rain on you, like I'm about to break a levee
Hold up, that pussy petty
Yeah, your nails did, your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine, ho!
Tried to make some time, ho!
But I ain’t got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line, ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas; fuck you and Mick Romney!
I’m grown now, I’m on my own now
I’m po-o-o-oppin'
Change my phone now when I get home now
I got o-o-o-options
Fast forward, wait, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
And your three kids and three baby daddies
And car note that’s overdue? I know

When the lights go out

So, I told her like oh darlin
I feel like I am fallin’
I think I’m in whatever, it is they call it

I’m talkin’ bout love
My friends say I’m trippin but baby I don’t really give a fuck
Oh, oh. Pardon my french girl I just wanna know what’s up
I told her we should kick it
But all I heard was crickets

[Verse 1: Kristo]
I’m like “Girl whatcha doin for today?”
Im thinking maybe me and you should go and run away
And now I don’t believe in love at first sight
But after seein’ you baby maybe I might

Cause when you walked by. I knew you we’re my type
The apple of my eye. You’re flyer than a kite
Okay alright, I know that was kinda corny
But (but) I’m just warmin’ up

Look at you, look at you, all dolled up
Look at me, Look at me, gettin’ caught up
Goin’ down, goin’ down, yeah I’m shot up
But hopefully, you got a number I can call up

And If you do girl, that be super
These chicks hot, but you’re so much cooler
And I was hoping she would give me a chance
She walked by and didn’t gimme a glance. Damn

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A-Wolf]
Yeah, yeah, I said “Girl whatcha doin’ on the weekend”
And she said “I don’t even know depends”
But you’re the one that I’ve been seein’ in my dreams and
Maybe we can get together in the evening

I know we just met but fate I believe in
I know a spot where the stars just peek in
If love is deep, I’ll put both feet in
Show me where the sea is, I’ll be in the deep end

Ha. Your beauty got me sinkin’
Got me sayin’ “all this shit” without thinkin’
I probably sound like I spent the night drinking
Or these are lines that I’m always repeatin’

But it’s the heart on my sleeve
That wanna know if your might have a spare key
But if you’re a heartbreaker then please spare me
Damn, she was apparently

[Verse 3: THX]
In this light, you’re lookin’ like you’re inflight

Than the next strand, better than the next strand

I don't even understand, why she'd ever want a man
If she ever throw it, I'd catch it like a cornerback
Like a cornerback, that's an interception
You think I give a fuck, that's a misconception
Oh what a night, oh what a night
The roof is on fire, so what? I'm high
I said, oh what a night, oh what a night

You gotta stretch it out, girl move that there
She bend it over, touch her toes when she toot that there

Who back there? I'm back there

[Verse 4: Tyga]
OK, open up your Bubba Gump, let me see your bumper
The booty so smooth, can't believe it's not butter
I go in from under, she wetter than a surfer
I ate the pussy fast, I'm about to start burping
I burp, burp and re-lick the bottom of the surface
I loaded my clip in and told her, ""Don't get nervous""
I'm a Bang Bang Chiddy Bang, bang, bang killer
Nipple tit clit licker, ball like a dribble
Put you in a pickle, nibble on my dickle
Why you tripping? I'm a crazy individual
Never do minimum, drive Benz, Bentley too
Damn, bitch, talk much? I don't want interviews
I'm trying to get into you (into you) then make you my enemy
Not playing, got the bitch mad
Me don't like flat screen ass, I need a 3D

Even though I
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill, ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked – look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows; thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on, stare in the mirror
But it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?!""
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down(this crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you asking
So all you see is what you lacking, not what you packing
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Bridge: J. Cole + TLC]
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothing like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation, that’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation
Or in jail, wonder why we inhale
‘Cause we in Hell already, I asked if my skin pale
Would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody getting killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, I'm well now
If you asking will I tell now – ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitching ‘cause man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down(this crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Bridge: J. Cole + TLC]
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em

Love you then they hate you
Then they love you again
Hate you then they love you
Then they hate you again

[Hook: Sam Dew]
(Keep giving me love) hold me tight, (and then you take it away) let me go
(Keep giving me love) heal my heart, (and then you take it away) hurt my soul
(Keep giving me love)
[They’ll never ever, ever know your soul]
Build me up, (and then you take it away)
[Never know your heart] break me down
(Keep giving me love) Make me smile, (and then you take it away) make me frown

[Verse 1: Wale]
Yeah, ain't no love in the heart of city, that's what they told me
Beef with over 100 niggas, don't none of 'em know me
Son of a mother studying at UDC
Sitting in taxi cabs, where daddy roaming the streets
Seven hallelujahs, my sutana was clean
On everything I wear it, all the America's tees
This whole system most prolific in the DMV
Listen when you get the keys it's seldom, you don’t get the beef
Make a nigga wanna get the piece to get to peace
You gon' need more than Wikipedia to get to me
PG to Mo County bet they all know about me
Every hood, every 'burb, I got superb balance
From the city that made me love you forever for it
Hope you celebrate every moment forever ignore it
You made me what I am, you made me what I'm not
They gon' love you a little different when you at the top

[Bridge: Wale] x2
Give me love, baby
Not enough, not enough, just a touch, baby
What the fuck, baby? It's just us, baby
This ain't right, this is life
This a love hate thing

Give me love, baby
Not enough, not enough, just a touch, baby

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yeah, my affinty grows as the city gets cold
As you reaching your goals, you gon' meet you some foes
Having dinner with Leonsis I'm dreaming to own
But for now me and my homies see the bottom floor
I'm trying to redefine the culture, and renovate the soul
Women in town, but I'm manifestating every goal
I see potential in John, talk to him once a week
Media targets in our city it ain't ever sweet
I lost a lot of friends and they ain't even dead
When I was on my way up, why you ain't see the stairs?
Lord father if I opted to follow them
My heart would tear from my dreams let me know that you here
And it's rare when I'm anywhere with too many heads
Niggas jealous and never tell it until they stare
How could you blame us envy?
We do the same thing for a living
Know the same niggas, but they all commend me
Champagne I'mma spill it until we all fill up
Maybe it stopped me from giving a fuck about opinions
And probably not, but I'm temporarily out of fizzucks
So tell the post to leave propaganda to politicians

When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
Cause girls only say ""hate you"" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes and goes
You say ""be real"" I try, I don't
Cause you take anything and just make it everything
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (Funny, right?)
And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)
One time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy
I drank too much, please call me a cabby
Penthouse after party hoes want that addy
Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row is when you call, I hit cancel
Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like ""Why you still talk to my mama?""
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo?
Man, fuck this tattoo you the reason I wasn't single in college
What? All because I had you, nigga I dont even have you
How am I suppose to get past you?
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit
Now they problems he got to deal with

Girl, don't believe them hoes
Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Muah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, ""ain't no woman like the one I got""
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that would make me a one eyed fuck
Sch, I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

1391,2452,30929,Jay Z Featuring Beyonce,Part II (On The Run),21,2013-07-27,"

[Intro: Beyoncé]
Who wants that perfect love story anyway, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah?
An innocent love I'm misunderstood, yeah?
Black hour glass, our glass
Toast to clichés in a dark past
Toast to clichés in a dark past

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Boy meets girl, girl perfect woman
Girl get to bustin' before the cops come running
Chuck the deuces, chugging D'USSÉ, ugh
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say

[Beyoncé]
I don't care if we on the run
Baby as long I'm next to you
(Uhuu)
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out the best in you
Why

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but

[Hook: Beyoncé]
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you
Take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit
Matching tats, this Ink don't come off
Even if rings come off, if things ring off
My nails get dirty, my past ain't pretty
My lady is, my Mercedes is
My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas
You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga
You know it's till the death, I hope it's obvi to niggas
Ugh
Cross the line, speak about mine
I'mma wave this Tec, I'm a geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clack
Push your mothafuckin' wig back, I did that
I been wilding since a juvi, she was a good girl
'til she knew me, now she is in the drop bustin' Uey's, screaming

[Hook: Beyoncé]
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you
Take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Deeper than words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it

[Beyoncé]
I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
(Uhuu)
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but

[Outro: Beyoncé]
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
(Without you I got nothing to lose)

[Intro]
(You see this motherfucking face)
Blessings, blessings, yeah, I see..

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family, this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story, this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Dope boy still smelling like cocaina
White boat, white robe, can he be more cleaner?
The oil spill that BP ain't clean up
I'm anti-Santa Maria
Only Christopher we acknowledge is Wallace
I don't even like Washingtons in my pocket
Black card go hard when I'm shopping
Boat dock in front of Hermes picking cotton
Silk and fleeces, lay on my Jesus
Oh my God, I hope y'all don't get seasick
See me in shit you never saw
If it wasn't for these pictures they wouldn't see me at all
Aww, whole world's in awe
I crash through glass ceilings, I break through closed doors
I'm on the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11

[Hook: Frank Ocean]

This water tells my story, this water knows it all

Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Me and Ty Ty is like Pablo and Popeye
Winding dirt roads on mopeds spilling Opus
Welcome to the magnum opus, the Magna Carta
The best-selling author Decoded
On the holiday playin' ""Strange Fruit""
If I'ma make it to a billi I can't take the same route
Swoosh, that's the sound of the border
Swoosh, and that's the sound of a baller
Muhammad Hovi my back against the rope
The black Maybach, I'm back inside the boat
Shepard Fairey they finally gave me some hope
Can't believe they got a nigga to vote
Democrat? Nope, I sold dope
In trouble waters I had to learn how to float
On the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, Ocean 11

[Hook: Frank Ocean]

The devil talkin' to me, but I dont hear him
Act like I'm deaf like So-So
Fuck you, fuck him, fuck them
Fuck my ex and her cohorts
Hundred bottles in the club, for no reason
Niggas start trippin boom bow dope fiend
Fendi on my shoes, Fendi on my belt

I don't got money problems, I got trust issues
Two things I gotta stay is with the two pistols

In them Wolf Greys like it's my house
Drinking out the bottle, I got no respect
Looking like a model, who just got a check
I back it up, cause I don't give a fuck
If you're a lame, that's a shame you can't hang with us
I'm MC Hammer fly, you can't touch
J's so fly I should work at Flight Club

Thank God for the first nigga started trapping
Thank God for the first nigga started rapping
Thank God for the first girl to start stripping
And I'mma have to keep it muhfucking real with 'em
I got a problem with these niggas
I got a problem with these bitches
Trigger finger keep itchin'
I pull it, I do it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Hang up on a bitch, call it crucified
Time to go to work, no suit and tie
Bumpin' Makaveli, I be trappin' out the telly
My nigga did a dime and he back already
Got that sack already, man we got them racks already
As far as your girl, I hit it from the back already
I tried to get a tan, but I'm black already
Your pockets on a diet, my pockets fat already
Three niggas with me, me myself and I
God don't like ugly, you should testify
My T-shirt come from Bergdorf
I make so much on a verse I take the third off
Bird call, swerve off
Bust a nut on her, tell her that's a load off
Shorty ass soft, like a Nerf ball
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
Drank in my cup holder, hope this shit don't spill
Pull up in the new edition and that's word to Johnny Gill
How I come up with this shit and all these verses that I kill
I have no imagination, everything I do for real
Bitch I'm camouflage down put your camera phone down
If she got an ass and the girl a fan, it's going down
I'mma fuck you like I've been waiting a century for it
Give the pussy up and I'll trade you the memory for it
In the bedroom forever that's what her roommate will tell you
Man I just hear this shit and think about what Tunechi will tell you
He might call up Patricia, she 'bout to call up Melissa

[Lil Wayne]
Tell 'em come to the crib and do them both, double dribble
I'm colder than a hospital, she love the dick that I give her
Hit her from the front, back, side, twist her like cigarillos
I put the gun to the pillow, I don't want blood on my clothes
Gotta keep that Trukfit fresh, shoutout to all of my hoes
Tunechi...

That's just how my OG would sum it up

Well, if you know like I know that pussy pop like pyro
And she know I'm a pothead, that pussy like a pothole
I’m colder than the snot nose, man all these hoes is my hoes
If she bougie fuck her once then leave her hanging, dry clothes
I just built a cemetery, niggas dying to get in
Niggas lying, they pretend
Don’t cross that line its paper thin
High as a star, make a wish
I’m a shark, I ate the fish
I got no heart, I hate that bitch

[2 Chainz]
You hate that bitch, well I hate that bitch
Will jump a nigga like a chessboard
Do a drive by while you’re riding on your skateboard
They ain't even know it
Have Drake sing a song just to get her pussy wet
Then I take her to the crib
Man fuck that bitch right on the step
Put it in and take it back out, then I back out
Hair weave killer known to snatch the fucking track out
Put me in the game coach, I'm the antidote
Pull up, kick, throw and take the money and the dope
True, 2 Chainz, I'm on a plane and a boat
I am so cold I need a cover and a coat
Kick it at the mall, call it football
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all

Y'all ready? 1, 2, 3
Right now it's me time
A little time for myself, me time
Oh yeah, right now it's me time
Don't want no one else now, me time
Bitch please don't call my phone, don't call my phone
Said I wanna be left alone, be left alone
Please, please don't stop by my home
No, no cause I feel it's just matter of time
Till you people make me lose my mind
I'm 'bout to leave this world behind
Right now it's me time
You need to go kick rocks now

Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off

Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion

I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it

Sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine, I let you eat like that
I've been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back? (No more free Randy)
I’m blessed than a motherfucka
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a motherfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you

Good God Almighty—like back in the old days...
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

Or work with their parents

My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance

When I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy a
And not say I'm the greatest
Of my generation, like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think she's straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me
Always couldn't believe when he called me
You never know, it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg

[Produced by Kanye West]

[Intro]
Wished I had told ooh was (the) only one (uh oh!)
But it's too late, it's too late he's gone

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You sweat her and I ain't talkin 'bout a Coogi
You a Big L and I ain't talkin 'bout Cool J
See me at the airport, at least twenty Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay
(Brother Numpsay!) groupies say I'm too choosy
Take em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way

[Hook]
Gone we striving home
Gone I ride on chrome, it's too late

[Verse 2]
Y'all don't want no prob' from me
What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer in the winter
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught something on the Usher tour, he had to let it burn
Plus he already got three children
Arguin' over babysitters like bitch it's yo turn
""Damn Ye it'd be stupid to diss you
Even your superficial raps is super-official""
R-R-R-Roc Pastelle with Gucci on
With TVs in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with Doobie Long
Cause I dookied on any song that they threw me on, gone

[Hook]
We striving home
[Cam]
I ride on chrome
We striving home
[Cam]
Killa, I ride on chrome

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Knock knock, who's there? Killa Cam, Killa who?
Killa Cam, hustler, grinder, guerilla true
Oh my chinchilla blue, blue you ever dealt with a dealer
Well here's the deal, ma we going to the dealer woo
No concealing, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag niggas still doing puff-puff-pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell em
Hey back in a touched up Jag shit
Y'all niggas wanna get in Cam's cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell em too late
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm gone
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy, acting like a thief in disguise
Ain’t even my size, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby, I hustle, brought weed to the Chi, shit
And that ain't even a lie, please believe me
Gave Weezie a piece of the pie and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole West Side I explore with the Bimmer now

[Hook]
We striving home, I ride on chrome
Listen, homeboy, move on
That's your best bet, why's that, Cons'?

[Verse 4: Consequence]
I been pouring out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And trying to help his Momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got afoul on what could've gone wrong
Now they asking Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money might have gone to my head
Cause they got me thinking money might have gone to the Feds
So I had gone to the dread, but he had gone up to bed
And when I came the next morning he was gone with my bread
And with that being said I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But looking back now, I should've gone to the crib
And rented Gone With the Wind, cause I'da gone in by ten
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talking shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is telling me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for twenty years doing time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some petty crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone

[Verse 5: Kanye West]
Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh
I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me ""Benz or Rover?""
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, ""Sorry, Mr. West is gone""

I will never let you drown
Even if we're going down
Heyo, never let go of me
When I'm sinkin'

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Loose lips sink ships, that's what someone told me
But this boat will stay afloat for as long as you hold me
We been through rough water, anytime it was tougher
But the fact I came back to remind you I love ya
And if that's not enough, well I can one up ya
I pinky promise, touch thumbs, I'll never make you suffer
And all I ask in return is some reciprocation
I'll be your oxygen when you're running out of patience
So take a deep breath, and hold it tight
My heart is yours, just reassure me that you'll hold it right
Don't be offended, I'm just the cautious type
To always be around and hold you down and never under, like

Hey yo, never let go of me (never let go)
Hold tight, it's gonna get hard to breathe (hold tight, baby, hold tight)

This is my message in a bottle, I hope that you receive it
If it washes up at your feet then open it and read it
To whom it may concern, insert your name here
It's destiny that we were both born in the same year
Three months apart, but on the same sphere
Staring at the sun, inhaling the same air
This type of love we got, they'll never get it
I'll be the Leo DiCaprio to your Kate Winslet
Sometimes I panic but I never take it for granted
I'll hold you 'til my lips turn blue like Jack in Titanic
And if I lose my grip, then just promise me this
You'll keep my love in a locket and always rock it, like

That was never meant to be held onto
But you let it go, if it comes back it was meant to be
If not, just let it be

As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Give me that late 80s early 90s old school
Feeling like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if he's ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But it's old school, it's like '03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past
Wassup...

As long as I'm here, as long as you love me

Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good
Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood
If you don't know what, then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a track, and if you want a (eeeeeeeh)
You have to make it like that
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody else's past

Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If you're life like Christ live your midlife like it's... Christ-like
Nigga I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school
Wassup...

I'm leaving it all up to you darling, giving you everything you want
And give me that old school love right now

And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep; one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm…

Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders)
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wandering off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head, keep knocking
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head is saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the…

[Hook: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Well, that’s nothin'
Well, that’s nothin'

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed, and
I'm coming straight at MCs, blood gets spilled, and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it, and
Relates, that's great, it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothing into something, still can
Make that, straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the…

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head

[Intro: Eminem and Sia]
I can feel the heat risin'
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder
Of why we can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, ‘cause…

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today's like the morning after; your world is torn in half
You wake in its wake to start the mourning process
And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter
It's like an enormous asthma
Thunderstorm has passed ya
You weathered it and poked its eye out
With the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is
Stuffed, so focused on the bright side
Then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But every day is a new learning curve
As you steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve, but you have to
To avert a disaster; lucky no permanent damage
‘Cause they hurt you so bad
It's like they murdered your ass, and threw dirt on your casket
But you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past
Standing in the inferno and chant…

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're so familiarized
With what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died
‘Cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive
Although today you may weep, ‘cause you're weakened
And everything seems so bleak and
Hopeless, the light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in; that's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good
That you're willing to forgive 'em
Even after all the shit you been put through, this feeling
Of resilience is building, and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in, but you're fireproof
Flame retardant, you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin'
You look down, ‘cause you're so over 'em
You could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

[Bridge: Eminem]
As time passes, things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remain the same
But tomorrow, today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this livin' hell
Still a little piece of you dies as you scream…

[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Bridge: Sia]
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned from fighting fights that weren't mine
Not with fists, but with wings that I will fly

[Hook: Sia]
And I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Something's burning, I can't figure out what (out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded; must
Just be the powder from the power of (love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse’s moan?
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
‘Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts – brace
Hope it ain't, ""Here we go, yo!""
‘Cause my head already goes to worst-case
Scenario, though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face
First, ""No (slurp) you don't (slurp) under (slurp) stand (slurp)
I (slurp) don't (slurp) do (slurp) this for anyone, ever.""
Yeah, that ain't what they all say
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiancé
'Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e
Polow Tha Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
Guess I'm gettin' my g-god dang Jigga on, eh?
‘Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playin'…

The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah, she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her: (Go where you wanna go!
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care!)
And I told her: (Go where you wanna go!
Go do whatcha want to do; I don't care!)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told that bitch I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick
Suckin' dick in your momma tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion
They booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
""Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris Wheel
Fuckin' spinnin' on me
Fuck you think? We gon' get married still?
Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it
Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day."" Bitch, you serious?
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me
You cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singing, ""I hope she's good enough""
Meanwhile you're chasin' her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the…

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record, cliché, it's all my fault anyway
She's turning the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
Back together but forgot today was her b-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding
But just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goddamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racing at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried this stink ho in it, then pay to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state, in a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, ‘cause she's laying next to me in bed—directly aiming a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, ""Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab.""
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, ""Hit the road"" and after she left, I sent that bitch a text
I said, ""Be careful driving, don't read this and have an accident""
She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad, thought we had a connect, no sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oreal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling
While the whore was yelling, ""Rape!""
'Til her vocal cords were swelling
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates and my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of… (*Message sound*)
""Wait, dinner at eight?""
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of…

What do we do, ohhh, when it rains?

When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true

Hold on, hold on, hold up Future, what the fuck you doin'?
You can annihilate way more chicks than the chick you screwin'
You on top of your game, homie, man you a star
You got real bitches, they love that nigga that you are
They say you're like Jimi Hendrix, in his early twenties
You in Vegas, you supposed to be with a snow bunny
You a player, huh, you wanna come around and save her
Keep it trill, you lovin' her just as much as your career
You mad ill, I knew you'd be the one to keep it real
And I can't even lie, dog, when I see y'all it gives me chills
And Imma stand behind y'all because I know the way you live
Aye just do me this favor, give it time, time reveals

We've been in the same place, for a long, long time
If our hearts go the wrong way, I still know you're mine
Should we even try to fight it?
If our love is trapped in all ways
I know that things been rough
But when you're by my side
It's more than enough, yeah
For us to make it through the test of time

When the sun dies and the stars fade from view

Standin' in the middle of humility
Can't nobody never love you more than me
Can't nobody never love you more than me
If love is all you need, I'm all you'll ever need
I can never be scared of commitment
I can prevail through life without bein' malicious
I can't hold you for responsible for your mischiefs
I hope you are never huntin' me with vengeance
I'm not predictin' anything, I'm just listenin'
Congratulations, you made it, you coulda missed it
And I'm acceptin' your past but forgiveness
And with all the mistakes I've made, you're still listenin'

Real and true (x4)
And I can fight temptations off
I ain't soft, no I ain't soft
You can't be lettin' the rap shit go to your head
Can't be cancellin' no shows, fuckin' up your bread
Check out these rumors, that ain't nothin' but the devil
That's why we gotta continue to pray together

[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

[Hook: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went in headfirst, never thinking about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve
""Little prick, just leave!"" Ma, let me grab my fuckin' coat
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when, Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope!)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house—it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house
The oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged
And I hate it though, but…

[Hook: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 2: Eminem]
‘Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Momma, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's taking over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry; the shit is painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear
Few may be as heavy as yours, but I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have, ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress
Every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you could've bet your asses, if I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths
And I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a tribute
I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to get this off my chest
I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt
I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I'll always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom

[Hook: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Bridge: Nate Ruess]
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Now I want two hundred and ménage in my palace
Walkin' out the jeweler with no mothafuckin' balance
Somewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chalice
Rims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I was childish
'Til I fuck a girl, that girl tweeted that I was stylish
When we fucked again, she told me ""That was just some foul shit""
I walk into the room, you can even hear all the silence

[Bridge: Betty Wright]
I can feel his blessings wash away my sins
I'm sanctified and, I have been born again
Now I proclaim, hallowed be thy name
Ohhh

Whippin' the yam, whippin and flippin' the yam
Turn the whole brick to a Lam
Re-rockin' the dope, soon as it get off the boat
Keepin' it soft like a mink
Gold on my link, coke in the sink
Choppin' that work like karate
Servin' a new Maserati, in a brand new Maserati
That's a whole lot of new money
Snatch it, then hide it from the 12
Movin' them squares and them bales
Servin' the rawest of yayo
Beating that china like Kunta Kinte
Whippin' it, whippin' that fish and Parkay
Drinkin' on syrup, I'm rollin' up haze
Made myself a boss, a boss and a plug
Either way you put it, nigga, I'm good
Triple salute, nigga, straight out the hood
Bakin' soda water splash the scales
Fork in my right and my pot in my left
Leanin' all the way over to the side
I whip me a four way to a nine
The dirty, the money is homicide
And my recipe can't be televised

Young enough to still sell dope
But old enough that I knows better
When they sayin' it's 42 for that white powder, I knows better
Get it, nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever
And flood their Rollie till the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tails
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH! Look at the clues
The J's, the jewels, I'm actin' a monkey
From 16 years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies
Pablo, Versace way before Migos
My dinner plates, no silverware, all you niggas my hijos
Toss a kilo like a free throw, crack house, it had the peephole
Made it through to the other side
Now nothing's big as my ego, Push

Me, I try to leave the best for later
But Pusha tried to put me on the respirator
The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite
Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship
She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes
That's Comme des Garçons and the Buffalo
I know guerrillas with the triggers that's on a banana clip
And packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knocking over vehicles
These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea niggas
These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas
These niggas hit the weed then they lean niggas, gee, nigga
If you got two hoes, you need to let one go
Two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro
There's an eye in the sky, I'm tryna let y'all know
Ain't no standards, I'ma set one though
Big ass bag but no man sandals
All that war, we need to let that go
That boom business, I'ma get that ho

Young nigga got that coke, whip that dope like a bad child
How you think about that coupe, with no roof?
Young nigga cashed out
Popped so many Percs, popped so many Xans
Young nigga 'bout to pass out
12 jump behind me, I got some in the car
Young nigga 'bout to smash out
Migo hit that line, say he got some bricks
Young fresh, 'bout to buy 'em out
QuikTrip 'round the corner, dropped a nine
Got the J's in the lunch line smokin' iron
Cocaine, cocaine cowboy, like Mickey Munday
Take over the project, whip a line, me no wait
I keep a .45 in my coat, while I'm servin' dope
The J's in my hood smoke that crack, say it give 'em hope
Serve a nigga whole brick, he hopin' that it come and go

[Intro: Diddy]
You wanted to fuckin' walk around these roaches. These niggas is roaches. These niggas is mere motherfuckin' mortals. I'm tryna push you to supreme bein'. You don't wanna motherfuckin'... You don't wanna embrace your destiny, you wanna get by
You don't wanna go into the motherfuckin' dark where it's lonely. You can't handle the motherfuckin', the pain of the motherfuckin' not knowin' when the shit is gonna stop

[Hook: French Montana]
Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
""Blast for me"" – the last words from my nigga
On the pavement, born killers, body shivers
Drug money, dollar figures
Hustlers movin' out of rentals, art of war is mental
Havin' sushi down in Nobu
Strapped like an Afghan soldier, nowhere to go to
So it's bang, no survivors
Only riders on my rider, murder rate rises
Stalkin' niggas on their IG's, never; I be
Still solo, Under Armour still Polo
No wire, on fire
My desire for fine things made me a liar, a shooter
Gettin' high feelin' like it's vodou
Nine lives, SK with the cooler
Makaveli in the 'Rari, still B-I double G, I, E
I pray you smoke with me
Go to bed with a kilo like Casino
Janet Reno, we all we got the creed of Nino
Pretty cars in the driveway
If you cut it then you sideways, double up, crime pays

[Hook: French Montana]
Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

[Interlude: Diddy]
You fuckin' wanna walk around with these niggas? What the fuck is their culture? Where the fuck is their souls at? What defines you? These niggas with these fuckin' silly looks on their faces. You wanna walk around with them or you wanna walk with God, nigga? Make up your goddamn mind

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm from where the streets test you
Niggas mix business and pleasure where the cocaine measure
The narcotics is our product
The by-product, you walk up on me, I cock it
New Mercedes as it peels off
Nothin' penetrates the steel doors, gang signs, see 'em all
I said my prayer as I'm countin' sheep
Never really athletic, but I play for keeps, do you feel me?
The mortician, the morgue fillin' with more snitches
We kill 'em and takin' their bitches, R.I.P
Chinchillas on a winter night
Black bottles when I'm feelin' like, you wanna know what winners like
And I'm never on that tour bus
Just a decoy for niggas, the PJ's for two of us
Ciroc boys down to die for Diddy
My niggas ride for less, keep it real, homie, made me filthy
Touch mine, until it's even: kill
Like I'm knowin' every heathen will, closed the deal with Steven Hill
We Magic City of the networks
Cut a nigga cast off, how my nigga net worths

[Hook: French Montana]
Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

[Outro: Diddy]
Fuck you wanna talk about? Fuckin' jewelries and Bentley's and Hublot's and fuckin' art that niggas ain't got on their fuckin' walls and fuckin' mansions niggas ain't got. Niggas can't even pay the IRS, let alone their fuckin' staff, nigga. You gotta tell the truth, man. The truth'll set you free, son, the truth will set you free

[Intro: Priscilla Renea]
Seems like your heart stops working
The minute they close the curtain
You take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're taking a smoke break
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doing
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just cause you got somewhere to go
So you take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've got a prescription
You got an addiction
Who do you think that you're fooling?

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
John Doe, I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe, ooh oh oh oooh
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Errybody's addicted to something
Errybody's got to grip onto something
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
Maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or something to find
You're struggling in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private
People that you work with noticed the signs
When you walk in the room
It gets noticeably quiet
So you break up the silence, you say you've been at the gym
But the way that you look, you can't blame on the diet
So what you hiding?

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
John Doe, I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe, ooh oh oh oooh
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh
Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah, I've probably had too many things
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to dro...(I mean)
Had too much to drink
Left the club, ended up in custody
Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up with me cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her ""Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slip and fell, clumsy me!""
Well, at least I admit it, cause the worst you could do
Is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it, well I ain't no different
I love all the money, the fame
And the parties with beautiful women
I'd spent so much time as an underground artist
Cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge I become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn, when they pivot
And change your perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dying to wish and to live and experience
Everything possible
When I told them my dreams, they just said they ain't logical
Now, I can see it - it's optical

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
John Doe, I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home

Si me das la verde, ejecuto, si tu eres la jefa me recluto
Deja que ocurra, caliente que el tiempo transcurra
El ambiente la pone ardiente
Se pega y en el oído me susurra
Abusa y me engatusa, la falda mas cara combina con la blusa
Se mete en mi mente como una intrusa
Yo le digo que lo haga y no se rehúsa
Dame mas
Yo te llevo en la nave si tu te vas
Y quizás me digas que quieras mas mas
Yo quiero saber lo que tu das

You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
Trophy, I won me a trophy
A trophy, I won me a trophy
Trophy, I won me a trophy
A trophy

[Verse 1: Future]
Get to fuckin' on the dresser just to make that pussy wetter
Gotta put you in that vintage then you rockin' Perry Ellis
Then I leave with you, only cause I believe in you
We get to bangin' on the walls just to piss the neighbors off
You and them twelve foot ceilings, I just painted the halls
So I can breathe with you
I want to live my dream with you
You say that money don't matter it's the times and the memories
And now that ass gettin' fatter and I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me, got you in custody
Whoever knockin' at the door, they gotta wait 'til we finished
I know I started at the bottom but that ain't where we endin'

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You the number one trophy wife
So it's only right to live the trophy life
You grew up on J. Lo, Timberlands by Manolo now
Till one day I put an angel in your ultra sound
I wanna dip that ass in gold, I wanna dip that ass in gold
I made it over NBA, NFL players
So every time I score it's like the Super Bowl
Baby, we should hit the south of France
So you could run around without them pants
I put that glacier on your little hand
Now that's the only thing without a tan
My trophy on that Bound bike, I gave you only pipe
If people don't hate then it won't be right
You could look at Kylie, Kendall, Kourtney and Khloe
All your Mama ever made was trophies, right?

[Verse 1: Wrekonize & Bernz]
You said you'd never ever break... down
But here I am sweeping... pieces off of the ground
You said you'd never, ever play... to crowds
But I've seen you hoping to play songs to them now
I've spent all night long scared of tomorrow, I broke my alarm
Everything is almost lost, pick it up slow, before it's gone...

[Hook: Wrekonize & Kendall Morgan]
We’re fragile
(Wish I’d have known)
I never thought I’d be so fragile
(You’re not alone)
If it didn’t break before, it’s about to
(We’ve been here before)
I don’t ever want to change
I’m fragile
I don’t ever want…
I don't ever...

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Some of the people appointed to give an opinion
Never do get it
I want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and... die
N9na be givin the remedy and why?
Critics are really the enemy and I
Can't stand the way they slam today's gifted
Effin' incredible, get fanned away with grands to pay
This jam will lay scripted
Deaf and impeccable
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
I'm the N9ne I'mma look very mean
When a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
By the times it'll be better, leave it in the sto
Cause they wrote nothin' but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes
Amateur writer dissin'
He's a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks I'mma despise
Never do try to listen
It's real - I'm mad
Clueless when you scribble on your pad
How you gonna criticize now with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad
You don't really get why I'm so pissed? Understand this:
I'm an artist, and I'm sensitive about my shit, yes I'm

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me that I'm famous
Tell me that my name is
Big as Venus Jupiter and then Uranus
Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know you're heinous
Tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
Unconditional, I'm hoping I'm your favourite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
That's the feelin' I get when you're concentratin'
On this pen, on this pad
Tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
Stop...
Puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
Drop...
This is more than you, and this is more than you
And your entire building slanderin' and abusin'
What I call the realest comin' from a student
Told myself to use a poem as an UZI
Empty magazine, I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin'
That was nicotine, I'm bout to smoke 'em all
And journalists involved should've known my music

Wake up in the world and I'm just another nigga
Call it public housin' when you next door to the killers
On the corners, it gets better as you go
Grind that mothafucka 'til it's yellow brick road
Free as a bird, spoken word in my verse
On my knees prayin', niggas shootin' in the church
Wake up out my sleep in another cold sweat
I lived on Billboard, where the fuck to go next?
Go against the odds, youngin' go and get a job
Another country boy they want back on the farm
So far from my goals but I'm close to my kids
Thug cry for Mac Dre throwin' up the Thizz

Well, let me light one for my problems
Smokin' on that loud, pumpin' up that volume
Get it crackin' like an eggshell
In this mothafucka make omelettes
Get a bad bitch that posts up like comments
They don't know what I been through
Don't know what I'm goin' through
As long as I get through, that's what I look forward to
Richer than a bitch but still I can't afford to
Let these niggas play with me; need to be remorseful
I swear I got that silencer on that Mac 9
And I kill these niggas with silence
My head stay in the clouds, I really feel like a giant
Can't trust none of these niggas, I murk one of these niggas
Then bury one of these niggas, still got dirt under my fingers
Ain't a threat, that's a bet, cause they coming at my neck
Like the best a man can get, but to make a long story short
I need a shoulder cause the devil on one
The other one, I'm lookin' over
Tunechi...

Niggas hatin' like it's Salt Lake City
No tints on that pretty-ass Bentley
Want you to know that them comments don't offend me
Cause your baby momma so friendly
I proceed with the plan, weed in my hand
Ciroc in my cup, quick pic for a fan
Money over bitches, first nigga with a Wraith
Double M, we handle business
Cause them niggas getting raped
Go get the yellow tape, it's well orchestrated
200 acres estates, a young nigga made it
Came from the hood, ain't nothing changed
Still lemon pepper on my mothafuckin' waaangs

Sometimes I ask myself, do thugs cry?

And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though

Studio with hella purp
I just put in hella work now look at where it got us at
Heard you got some new shit coming
Friends are all like ""shoot me something
Homie when you dropping that?""
Maybe I could be the biggest
Rapper working in the business, wait, I never thought of that
Just take a look at the scores, I put numbers up on the boards
I'm in a section with models
And you're at the bar tryna get at a cluster of fours
When that bottle pours I just keep drinking it straight
And get faded and pass out on floors
Homies like ""Bro, that's my girl, what the fuck are you doing?""
Oops, ain't know that was yours!

[Hook: 1]

[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
Ah, I just shitted on you
Probably licking your honey like Winnie the Pooh
Knock you on the ground then I'm lifting my boot
He get beat like Timbalands head of my group
These ain't Louboutins, but there's red on my shoe
Cause I let that Ruger fly like a pelican do
This rapper shit light, I'm telling you, dude
When I flow niggas drown on jell-o canoes
Better learn your algebra and your decimals too
Cause you square motherfuckers can't mess with my crew
Your bitch on my dick and her lesbian boo
They kiss on the dick, I caress on the boobs
Now I'm just deciding on what R.Kelly'll do
Just pissed on that bitch, filled her belly with juice
Minute Maid lemonade from my testicle, boo
That's what a nigga get when you testing my crew (boo)

[Hook: 2]
Talking 'bout whiskey bottles
(Gotta lotta lotta lotta that x2)
Talking 'bout skinny models
(Gotta lotta lotta lotta that x2)
Talking 'bout groupie chicks
(Gotta lotta lotta lotta that x2)
Talking 'bout lucid trips
(Gotta lotta lotta lotta that x2)

[Verse 4: Danny Seth]
(The British are coming)
Man, I gotta lotta bitches
All up on my dick head Danny
""Can I suck you off"" is all I'm really used to hearing
Call me Mr. Greedy cause I'm not the type for sharing
And I'm always seeing doubles so my bitches come in pairs
They tryna fuck with me
All my white girls sniffing Britney
They never used to notice now they digging me
Reverse Gerald's name cause I get 'em Eazy-G
Fuck boy talking out of turn
My brothers leave you sleeping in an urn
Yeah, I've had a lotta sex
And yeah, I've cut a lot of checks
I'm counting so much paper until my fuckin' fingers hurt
Swear I deaded off the beat somebody bring a hearse
Holler at my at my manager it's 10 K for a verse
That's why I'm filling all these empty duffle bags for features
Don't come around my presence with your mother's empty purse

I'm gonna love ya
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Than to mess with me, honey
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

[Verse 1]
This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothing to something, liking to loving
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feeling stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothing for us, ain't no place in between
Might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last but now you got em mirrored
And as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer
Now sing...

You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doing whatever works
You ain't never met nobody
That will do ya how I do ya
That will bring you to your knees
Praise Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Till you feel like you breathe for it
'Till you'll do any and everything for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
'Till it's got you gasping for air
And you lean forward
'Till they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothing but me, on it (on it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours and you want it
I want it, promise I need that
'Till I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back or quit
Cause this here is fatal attraction
So I take it all or I don't want shhh

Until they cripple, see I cook, like I’m slanging a weed sale
Until I triple bread, and whoop ‘em and drag 'em, like females (Sfu-ahe! Gasp!) Oh, see well, these niggas already know
The way that I fuck shit up, minus the details, the case is shut
Your bitch remind me of replacement butt
Kind of an ancient slut, it's going down
Like she was a basement fuck
Swell up this shit, like I’m sticking steaks in they gut
So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up
Ragdolling these niggas, and attacking
Like apes in the cut, I’m waiting for the taking
While I break niggas neck, like a bracelet (fuck!)
It’s kinda like, me having a case in the truck
And drinking ‘til I’m blasted
Harassing and erase a nigga (WHAT!)
Keeping 'em open and blacking until I’m leaving ‘em stuck
And got ‘em happier, than a child in a park chasing a duck
While I’m chasing a buck
These funny niggas be chasing they luck
I be lacing them up, like boots
When I’m pushing they face in the mud—
(Ahgah!) Missiles I fling, while I spit live wire
‘Til this shit circling back around
With more fire for me to melt a brick surfacing back a sound
While I light up shit that'll cause a quick worship
And gather around, it's certain this shit'll splatter cliques
Painful and make ‘em scatter (Blink!)
Shameful, the way I shatter (Split!)
Shit apart, it doesn't matter (Rip!)

And they break ‘em and they know it's (Classic!)

While I bite the beat up, and I'm starting to heat up (Yack!)
I’m chopping your foot off
Now it’s mine, and I’m putting my feet up (Blauh!)
Back to the hood and off to the wild
And I’m hoping you protect your child

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Apparently, there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
It just might make you sick, so irate
With this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
Is my mind scrambled? Cause I'm lit—narrow minded
But go through such a wide range of this emotion
That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
I just pulled up, in Clive Davis's driveway
With his personal memoir, saying ""He's bi!""
Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride
Making him cry, ""Rape!""—then arrive naked
And drive straight through the gay pride parade
""Yippee-Ki-Yay!"", cause here I—
Wait, did the world just pee on my leg?
And should I take it as a sign
Maybe to take 'em back into time? (Shady!)
I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave 'em the finger
To take the attention away
From my stinking face it was bringing
Changed the whole complexion of the game
But just in case you was thinking an inkling of replacing
The kingpin of crazy, you're wasting your ink then
So if this is any indication, of what you may be facing
You better make a distinction, cause you fake imitations
Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression
That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen
Who raps nasally? Eyes hazely?
Rhymes crazily, but sounds like he may
Need some Flonase when he's speaking?
What kind of stupid question is that?
""Hey Mrs. Abraham Lincoln!
Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
How'd you think that play was this weekend?""
You ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down faggot
See me on a ballot, I'm running for class clown
Rich Democrat bitch, so I'm just a candidate
To come fuck up the whole party
Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
To have every campus, on a fucking rampage
Act my goddamn age? I am—eight!
So let's get smashedand wake up the next day
With the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids
Glass ashtray smashe
Champagne splashed on the lampshades
But this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable
Shady for president ho, don't make me go take it back
To the days of old,with Sway & Tech radio
When I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
I almost fell asleep on the Wake Up Show
Fuck you telling me, fools?
I was rippin' shop, raisin' hell up in Drew's
When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
Me and Bus put it down, like a sick pet
You're fucking with vets dawg,fucking internet bloggers
""I sit in front of my computer all day
And comment on everything, I'm an expert on everything, Everything sucks—play the next song!""
Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop—you idiot prick
With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you
I'd be dead wrong—son of God, I'm the S.O.G.
Like a wet log, pores never get clogged
Cause I'm so full of self-esteem, that I sweat fog
Yes, yes y’all (Y'all!)—steady on the left, y’all
Step off, 'fore you get stepped on
Soft? 'Bout as commercial, as my fucking Lear jet
Jealously’ll get you as green as a Chia Pet
I can see that you’re visibly upset, dawg
Alert, alert, girl—alert
Once you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt
So (Jump around! Jump! Jump!)—get that ass shaking
(Jump around! Jump!)—came to hit you, with a fan favorite
But if you too fly for coach better get them arms
And freaking hands flailing and (Jump) like Van Halen
And pray for a damn tailwind
More afraid of success, than I am of failure
So what does that tell ya?
That on a grand scale, I don’t give a fuck about nothing
Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
Before he ran straight into the damn railing

[Outro]
Yo, chill man! CHILL!!

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called “Hi! My Name Is” dropped
Started thinking my name was Fault
‘Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent
Of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue, it was only entertainment, dog
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it, it was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain, I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
""Do I really belong in this game?"", I pondered
I just wanna play my part; should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful
Or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face
Before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging, it's your only outlet
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it… ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing
Different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is
If there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are, when I was afraid to…

[Pre-Hook: Sia]
I was a... afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

Guts over fear, I shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me 'round

I know what it was like, I was there once
Single parents, hate your appearance
As you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song, learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit harder shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows and I'm frozen
‘Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs, that I make for fun
So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song
But I rather make “Not Afraid 2”
Than make another motherfucking “We Made You”, ah
Now, I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just open enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt
‘Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells, I was made to walk
But thank you, Ma, ‘cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that stadium least I made it out of that house
And found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did
Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde
Lives on through you when I’m gone, and to think I was a…

[Pre-Hook: Sia]
I was a… afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run

[Hook: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, I shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me 'round
I let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

[Intro]
(Cardo got wings!)

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I said you already know nigga, Young gotta flow
Before rap, Young really got dough
Before rap, Young really seen snow
In the kitchen ‘bout to make some magic
Then blow it all in Magic
Pull up to my partner in traffic
Gave it to him, it was all in plastic
All I know, I ain’t tryna go to jail
Heard that shit closest thing to hell
When it's stepped on make it hard to sell
When you been where I been, make it hard to fail
Cause I’m the realest nigga in this
Y’all know it first nigga hitting magic in that 6-45
Valet say ""Jizzle nigga, stay in new shit
But everybody bach back ‘cause that nigga can’t drive""
Doors open up I emerge with ten chains
Even back then they was calling me ten chains
Ask me what I spent, I tell ‘em it’s no thing
Even if I had to add it up, it’da cost like ten things
We used to take a little show money just to throw money
If it’s on the floor nigga, its the floor money
If you brought it out to blow, when you got it from the blow
Then that’s why the fuck they call that shit blow money
Still the realest nigga in this, y’all know it
Kept it one hundred ‘til the day I came through
My nigga hit me up saying “going out of town”
So I threw him fifty thou, told him “bring me back two”
Not only had my fingers crossed, I prayed
Called this little piece up, got laid
Then he walked in, threw them both on the table said
“Fuck that shit, young nigga get paid”
Then I whipped the Benzo on Lorenzo
Stay down, nigga, yeah, I'm talking ten toes
Hoes see me in this big pretty mothafucka
Bet I leave the parking lot with about ten hoes (I done seen it all)

[Hook: Jeezy & Jay Z]
Yay stack seven feet tall
Swear it look white like a wall
What you know about thumbing through the hundreds
20s and the 50s, spending tens and the fives at the mall?
I done seen it all
20/20 Pyrex vision
Catch a contact standing next to my kitchen
Hear the 20s, 50s, hundreds, the money machine clickin'
And my Rollie ain't tickin', I ball
I done seen it all

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Uncle died on the spot
Pop killed the family with heroin shots (Real shit)
Gave my life to the block
Figured I get shot 'least I die on top (Real shit)
I came alive in the drop
Big body all white, shit looked like a yacht (Real shit)
I got ‘em five grand a pop
Had a plug in Saint Thomas on a trillion watts (Trill shit)
Flew him back to the States
Park 92 bricks in front of 560 State
Now the Nets a stone throw from where I used to throw bricks
So it's only right I'm still tossing ‘round Knicks
Probably brought your auntie a couple bags
I probably front your uncle a couple halves
I was in the S-Class you was just in class
You know I was finna blow like a meth lab
Expanded the operation out in Maryland
Me and Emory Jones in the caravan
Took the show on the road out in VA
Dropped a couple off with Rolla in the PA (Real Rolla!)
Plug got shot started slowing up
Took a trip down to see how he was holding up
The wars on now he got shot again
This time he was gone for good then we got it in
Emory got knocked we was down 10
The whole team hot, walls closing in
Niggas can’t tell me shit about this dope game
'Bout this cocaine, man I done seen it all

From the same city as the B-I-G
Wanna serve these bars, gotta see ID
Now I'm on their radar, where B-Dot be
Was a slave for the cars, then we got free
Used to only wanna pull up in a black sport
Just a white man excelling in a black sport
Now I'm really doing pull-ups
Got a honeymoon for the summer tryna get a six-pack for it
Say I won't catch 'Crae slippin' in the studio at like 3 AM
Autograph that forehead with a Sharpie pen and then Instagram
Might swag out a fanny pack
I might bring Velour back
Nobody wanna change the game, man y'all just want more trap?
Okay, say I won't rap over bagpipes
Say I won't talk about that price
To know Christ and live life like every night my last night
'Bout to switch up the program
I rock name brand, I rock no brand
My whole life GoPro cammed
I rap like I had no fans, nope
They say I know I say, ""Veto""
Danny DaVito, and Al Pacino, those are my people
Also I'm rockin' the speedo

Look, I'm from an era of fast living and mass terror
Boys covered in cover girls like mascara
I don't need to keep a gun and a mask ever
I still make 'em put their hands up, ask Derek
My road manager damage all of you amateurs
Sneaking up on a tour bus with a demo to hand to us
When I was younger, I just wanted a chain
Now a  chain of events has afforded a change
See, I been a rebel since back in the day, I don't follow the people
I follow the leader through valleys and shadows of death and I fearin' no evil
So say I won't do it, say I won't turn the music up and get to it
Won't come down H-Town all the way to their town
In the old school, drop top Buick
And I'm getting, maybe 8 or 9 miles to the gallon
Still feeling like a stallion
I got Andy ridin' shotgun with 30 gold chains on, talkin' 'bout he Italian
Say I won't go drop a double album, and rap double time on all dub-step
Got no producers, just me rocking over beatboxing by Doug E. Fresh

Part 1 - Sing About Me

When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow, I'm hoping that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted, I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction or a reaction
Of what we consider madness, I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride, it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, ""Get 'em""
I got 'em, and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality, it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young'n in pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'mma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope (gunshots)

[Hook]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 2]
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80, the message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was, I was hearing about it
But doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit, well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'mma need that forty dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I'm followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinkling keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em back
To where they used to be then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I'll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'mma get it or die trying
I'm eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help 'em
With my story, you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga...

[Hook]
When the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself:
Am I really scared of passing away? If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Reeking the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot, and every day the glass mirror
Get tougher to watch; I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wondering when I'mma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak of something that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like, ""It need to be told""
Cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continued rappin'
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four-
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day, you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?

[Hook]
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And it's my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Promise that you'll sing about me for-ooooh)
Promise that you'll sing about me forever

Part 2 - I'm Dying of Thirst

[Produced by Like from Pac Div]

[Verse 1]
Tired of running, tired of hunting
My own kind but retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst

[Verse 2]
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst

[Verse 3]
How many sins? I'm running out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of balling like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling, I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (money is power)
Yours is ours (yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

[Verse 4]
What are we doing? Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lying 'bout comin'
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding, and the beef is bubblin'
It's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst

[Verse 5]
Too many sins, I'm running out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, are stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, are stress days
Say ""Fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed; what's my next crave
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
Tired of tumbling, tired of running
Tired of tumbling
Back once my momma say
""See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst, you dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""

[Skit/Outro]
“Fuck! I’m tired of this shit! I’m tired of fuckin' runnin', I’m tired of this shit! That’s my brother, homie!”(""Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?)
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry? See you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means? That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of The Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior? Okay, repeat after me
""Lord God, I come to you a sinner"" (Lord God, I come to you a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins"" (And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord"" (I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe you raised him from the dead"" (I believe you raised him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life"" (I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And to be my Lord and Savior"" (And to be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life"" (I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
""And that I may live with him from this day forward"" (And that I may live with him from this day forward)
""Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood"" (Thank you Lord Jesus for saving me with your precious blood)
""In Jesus name, amen"" (In Jesus name, amen)
""Alright now, remember this day: the start of a new life
Your REAL life.""

It’s Mir.I.Am and you know who
Now here’s some things I think are ew
FaceTime and reclining in
Airplane seats and then Vining
Retweeting tweets, I'm not lying
Cuz even rhyming's annoying!
Bread bowls and ravioli, casserole, a roly poly
Caterpillar on my really old and moldy windowsill, ew
Trapper keepers and a creeper wearin’ sneakers
With the toes and maybe Frozen cuz you knowin’
I don't wanna build a snowman

Ew! Ew, ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew
Ew! Ew, ew! Seriously yuck!

Hello my name is Sara, that's Sara with no ""H""
Too bad if you don't like it, cuz haters gonna hate
My Stepdad Gary, he tries to act so cool
Every time we see him, my friends and I say ""Ew!""

[Outro: Stepdad Gary, will.i.am & Jimmy Fallon]
Hey funky bunch, what're you guys doing?
Oh my gosh, it's my step dad Gary
And he just ruined it!
I heard that funky beat that you was playing down here
It's a party over here, it's a party over here
Ew!

Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt fake, worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was Pop Quiz

I don't fuck with them chickens, unless they last name is Cutlet

But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, ""god damn, this is the perfect time""
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, lowkey or maybe highkey
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn’t take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I’m obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that’s right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you

Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin

So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms

I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And now things changin' a lot; he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely as 'bout it as retail fraud, he's sweet
The honest gesture
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester
We tell flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic in my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' make-up, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles, ol' Air, his coupe
Might as well ride by in an ambulance
My pair'll shoot, like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life; call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge
Is like lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
(Real talk!) I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches
That's none of my business, but I don't sip tea

100 percent cut; no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit, where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man, them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy, I hit the beat, I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit
And you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy, so I put my dog in the 'Vette
Ahh! Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
If the ball in my hand, then the ball in the net
Bitch, I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected
My mama gated community's overprotective
So futuristic I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway
Now my closet fifty shades of grey
26, and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings; yeah, a coupon
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Takin' down my number, like, ""You still ain't got a new line?""
Nah, it's the same, we been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months
But fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle
Don't want to, I need to, ya gotta learn to keep it cerebral

Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from failin', that's why they call it the D
Arguably the whole reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in them streets
‘Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas hit ya
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
If you think your hood harder, then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Miller
If the blicka hit your kisser, bet your ass not rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissorin'
So, nigga, I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Has K's in front your school, but I ain't going to Kettering

Xan got me cross-eyed, like Bernstein’s son

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like a refill of
Painkillers to pop the lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, Navy SEAL of bravery
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
Ain't bein' conceited, but I made it to radio; eat a dick!
I still never ABC'd the shit
Mainstream appeal, but the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' these streets
I swear that I would stay here still
And if I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an eighteen-wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here
And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from
On a rampage too crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch?
‘Cause I'm Adrian Peterson, when he's raging and heated
And on the way to go beat his kid?
On a track get spanked like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like we ain't shit
But Jesus, I can see just why people quit callin' me to do features, and them cyphers on BET, ‘cause if I wasn't me
I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' its fever pitch
One hundred and eighty degrees in here
Shoulder blade full of cedar chips
MC's just bit off more than they can chew
Like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and geniusness inconvenience
And for the record, you don't want this type of static in your life, when I'm makin' you cling to it
May consider tryin' to reinsulate your windows
May be in for another crazy winter
‘Cause so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away, but ain't this really what made me into the angry bitter blonde?
But ain't we sick of bein' underdogs?
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this pit
May even seem as if I'm yankin' your chain a bit
Or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with you, but ain't shit changin'
It's still the same shit and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and then attacked the babysitter
With a potato peeler
And mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
Or the Bermuda Triangle
And attempted to make a safe descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters 'fore you came here? And if they mention us...

You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along
I'mma ask on the song

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
So does she know I've been in that bed before?
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So, call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

Look like Mariah, I took another shot
Told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk, dirty dance
She a freaky girl and I'm a freaky man
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck

Why these bitches don't never be learnin'?
You bitches will never get what I be earnin'
I'm still gettin' plaques, from my records that's urban
Ain't gotta rely on top 40,I am a Rap legend
Just go ask the Kings of Rap, who is the Queen and things of that

Drippin' on that work, trippin' off that perc
Flippin' up my skirt and I be whippin' all that work
Takin' trips with all them ki's, car keys got B's

Got a good thing goin' with a bad bitch
You know who to call when you need it
Wish I had another you, I'm greedy
Sometimes like that nigga get greedy
Got damn I fell in love with a bad bitch
You know that every time you leave me
Even though I know how men be talkin'
I just know that nigga wanna be me
Came in here and fell in love with a bad bitch
Back then she ain't have shit
Now she grown up, she got ass, tits
Wanna know where she got that ass at
She hit my heart, a toot, toot on it
She got a dump truck, I put a boot on it
Don't mind spendin' this loot on it
Treat her like my whip, I put some shoes on her
Got a dump truck, put a boot on her
I don't mind trickin', spendin' loot on her
Walk up in the club, and toot, toot on her
She's a bad bitch, put shoes on her
God damn, fell in love with a bad bitch
Said, ""French, take me to Paris""
Dominican mami from Cali
I said, ""Gon' bend it over, let me grab it""
I said, ""Gon' bend it over, make it nasty""
Walked up in the club, rollin', Stevie Wonder glasses
I ain't lookin' at you niggas, lookin' way past you
Young, fly, G's up, pocket full of cash
You know where to find me, you know when you need me
All my dogs eat, they'll tell you I ain't greedy
I ain't gon' love her, too much to leave her
I ain't goin' public, surely is easy
Pull up with my niggas, make a move
Red light, green light, no it ain't Gucci
Used to walk up in the store, couldn't afford that
Now I walk up in the store, buyin' all that
Drink it to the head, man, nigga feelin' woozy
Pull up in the old school, boy I'm on some new shit
Red to the head, man we gettin' all that
And shorty phone answers, she don't ever call back
And I can see why these niggas hate me
Pull up in a drop and the watch 80
Pull up to the front but a nigga faded
Got a new crib and the shit gated
Came from the bottom, watch a nigga ball out
Drink it to the head, smoke 'til you fall out
Countin' up this money, nigga, keep the door locked
All my niggas gettin' to this money, no lie

I play guitar no need to worry 'bout my Drake hand
80,000 people in front of the stage, damn
Waiting for the sun to shine just to rock these Ray Bans
I just wanna leak shit (what?)
Not literally leak shit
Wanna push the music through the speakers
Double shot glass, I'm in the back of the pub
My mate Jason at the bar screaming ""Who want what?""
Now, please be warned
That every song I feature on has capacity to be reborn
I said that anything can happen when I pick up a pen
But now I'm all about love so won't you say it again
I said I used to be the shy type
Backpack on my back on public transport sort of guy type

For you, and for your friends
You can be mine, we can pretend
Oh, typical rapper actin' a typical fashion
I'm doing something that's different

We go together like interceptions and Revis

Three million records get sold and now everybody is winning

Uh, thinkin' out loud—
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here?
Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends
And you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house
Are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka—
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other
Whoop! — Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, thinkin' out loud—
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, thinkin' out loud—
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank, check in my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here?
Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom?
Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum
Put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless
Lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless
Largest in charge
And born in New Orleans
Get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly
Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie
You know!

Look

Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight... look)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog""
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I

I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay mom mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed

On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker

Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?

[Drake]
Yeah—sound, sound, sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it, I be with the bands
Like a nigga went to Jackson State or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

Floatin' all through the city with the windows down

It's gon' take some getting used to (what you say?)

Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the woes
I'm home now, I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times
To play games with 'em, I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her
In the same sentence, I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino, promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target

[Hook: Big Sean]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my step brother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like, ""Ain't too much that's different""
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?

Remember one thing, one man could change the world

My grandma told me, ""If you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white out""
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from, I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive?
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black, you had to extra-extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...

[Hook: John Legend]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place, uh

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Intro: Miguel]
I keep dwellin' on the past, babe
Know what I need, yeah

[Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
It's better to love and then lost than to never have loved at all
If that was true I wouldn't be drinking this alcohol
Every relationship failed to take a toll on you
Especially when you had hoes and area codes on you
Is it easier to erase my memories
At a point when most of my past women became my enemies?
Some on the fence, some befriended me
But when we see each other it's gon' be some weird energy
I'm sorry that we couldn't make it work
Believe in your heart, I never intended to make you hurt
Now they see me on the blogs with my new girl
Friends talking 'bout ""that's supposed to be you, girl""

[Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I got a empty hole in my chest
How do I fill it? Somebody give a prescription
I guess I gotta learn to live with regrets
Pay for mistakes and your exes take a commission
But what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom
After you break up wondering how to live without 'em?
Need solutions, less problems
Cause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum
Hear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em
Kinda lost, need someone to guide 'em
It's nothin' worse than feelin' alone
But I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes

[Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

[Bridge: Miguel]
So I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
On an empty bed
Dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat
Playing empty songs when I'm blowing my high
Feeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed
While I lose my mind
So you know what I need

[Hook: Miguel]
I need some real good lovin'
Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see
I need some real good lovin'
Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me

Who will deny that you and I and every nigga is a star?

[Intro: Josef Leimberg]
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You’ll slip through the cracks hopin' that you’ll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To pimp a butterfly

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When I get signed, homie, I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat ass monkey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the Pres with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that

[Pre-Hook: Thundercat]
We should've never gave
We should've never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should've never gave
We should've never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
(Everybody get out)

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
At first, I did love you (Love you)
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you (Of you)
Until I get my nut (Can I get my nut?)
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)
Destroyed, but what for?

[Break: Dr. Dre]
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want? You a house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché, then say, ""Fuck your haters""
I can see the borrow in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five

[Bridge: George Clinton]
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (when you're on top, you got it)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

[Pre-Hook]
We should've never gave
We should've never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should've never gave
We should've never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same
[Woman Moaning]
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk
Sex

[Bridge: Anna Wise & Kendrick Lamar]
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls, say hey (Hey), say hey (Hey)
(Ah, girl)
Everyone deserves a night to play (Play)
And she plays only when you tell her no

[Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
(I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk
(I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush

[Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
(I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk
(I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
If these walls could talk, they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them
I’m not involved, I’d rather diss them
I’d rather call on you, put your wall up
Cause when I come around, demolition gon’ crush

[Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat & Bilal]
If these walls could talk
(I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk
(I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper
Walls could talk

[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room

Right, I shoulda known you were bad news
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos
Cuz most guys only want one thing
But I'm undecided, tryna figure out if that's you
Either way though, I think you're worth a test drive
Cuz (ooh) you're so much better than the next guy
And a little trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

Don’t you come here thinkin' you ballin' (oh nah)

Smells like trouble to me

Opposites attract, I guess this is that
Good girl, bad guy what a perfect match
And if we ooo, you're gon' want to pay back tithes

I shoulda have never got involved in the first place
But second place never get the recognition, hmm
See what he doin' to me make have to shout it out
Got a hold on me, that's without a doubt
So clear now that he's a trouble starter
But I ain't a saint neither and these ain't no still waters

Just cause all the girls are falling at your feet
Don't mean no thing to me

Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy!

Why you gotta do me like that?

(My sincerest apologies, I mean it)
Look, I'll admit it, albeit pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me cause I'mma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel
Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong

Realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love)
I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of move ons
And dark, good nigga, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but

[Pre-Hook 2: Wale]
But I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though

[Hook: Usher]
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans, oh baby
I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Outro: Wale]
We ain't nothin' but some planets

Seinfield: I always feel like I’m a planet. And these other women that are, kinda moving through this solar system with me. And, marriage is like you decide to jump off of your planet, across to another planet. And you can only do it when one planet passes real close. And you look and you go, “Hey, I think I can jump across.”

I feel like the sky is falling down
Ain't nobody here to play around
Push it to the edge, I won't back down
Cause it's time to go hard or go home
One way up, no way out
I give it all, all for the family
We stay up, no bail outs
Give it all, all for the family (family, family, fa-fa-family

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Five, four, three, two, I got one shot
You lose the love and respect, that's where the trust stop
New work, top drop
I roll up every fifteen minutes like a bus stop
And you can smell just how I'm smokin' when I burn out
And you can catch me ridin' dirty, but my car not
It's love and loyalty until my heart lock
Never turn your back, won't know how it turned out
I said it once, I'll do it again
I'm playin' the game, I do it to win
With you and your friend, that's thick and thin
That's me and my team, you know we gon' win
You know we gon' ball, you know we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
You know we gon' stick to the course, we ain't thinkin' 'bout y'all

Swingin' on the green like I'm tryna get a par four
You ain't sittin' at my table, hope you starve
Ho, don't be pushin' my buttons 'less you startin' up my car
Pressure make a diamond, that pressure made me a star
Got a method to my madness, to bring me down by the bar
People always askin' me how I got this far
My response is just to keep it honest and be who you are
Now they call me Mrs. Money like I'm married to the moolah
Just to measure my success I need at least a hundred rulers
Glory, hallelujah, I'mma take that ass to church
I'mma finish like I started, Iggy still got that work

When she givin' me the neck, she gon' really get the check
Get the check like a money order
Got the Colombianas in the kitchen
Workin' with the soda, I ain't talkin' 'bout Coca-Cola
And all this money to the ceilin', I ain't worried 'bout the world
'Cause I got it sittin' on my shoulder

Check down there, they got the hair that's missin'
Keep it bare, I promise I'll never tear that kitten
I am aware sex hittin' is the care when I share that stick and
So good I might impair that vision
So I dip in, then dip off
Look for another chick, then they pissed off
Till I give them another spliff then they lift off
Party is the mission, I did cross

They big friend wanna lip off

Yeah, yeah, alright

[Verse 1: Drake]
Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move in to Graceland
Madonna’s a ting I know and I’m the king of pop
I’m building Never-Never Land
How he hate me when I never met the man
Woo! We might just get hit with the R.I.C.O

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly!
Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (switch it up)
Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even got to take it here?
Why we even got to play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on list's most wanted but now it's the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echos from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording

Good girls ain't no fun

Fell in love with that ride game
Swimming pool, you surfing on it
Like 'Yonce, do the surfboard, surfboard
They still think you a church girl
We linking up on your days off
And I still give you that work girl
Like work, twerk
Do it like that video
Wanted that for a long time
Cool with it, I get it though
First year we both fronted
We had feelings we didn't show

You'll be the first that I let in the door

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can hear the drummer drummin'
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone
I know something's comin'
But I'm runnin' from it, to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was?
Was it too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens?
‘Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
‘Cause here I sit in Lucifer’s den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin, even if it means I'm sellin' my soul
Just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
‘Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that? I’m somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark
This sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out
And I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
‘Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here
But I'm not a quitter; gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
‘Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
‘Cause someone told me that…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't give me that sob story, liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features
And try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be
A fuckin' blow-out to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback, as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage, and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em
‘Cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say!
It just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent-up rage, ‘cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
‘Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow, and I'm not gonna be…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck
You’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope, all you're gonna get is smoked
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again
All alone and on a throne, like a token of respect
Or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm
And launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go
I'm still not leaving, stop for no one, I don't know
But I've been told, an obstacle that blocks your road
Knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, ‘cause…

[Bridge: Eminem]
They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky!
Try to hold on and prolong these moments
‘Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus, I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness; kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
At Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas
Still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen
But Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat, ‘cause makin' the beat
Ain’t the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that sound-bombing, thirstin' howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God, just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Outro: Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die

[Intro]
I don't wanna hear at that, I don't wanna hear none of that
Talkin' to cameras like ""What you need?"" and all that shit
Fuck that shit, I don't remember none of that shit

[Hook 1: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 1: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, you went and switched sides?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on him?
Where your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? Came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco

[Hook 2: Future]
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

[Verse 2: Drake]
Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was ""what's the hold up?""
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we’re paying back dues
Where were you? When all the dogs needed help
Lawyers and the commissary ain’t gon’ pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain’t got no choice
Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I’m self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I’ll buy the neighbors house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, last winter was the coldest?
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders

[Hook 1: Future]
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 3: Future]
60 for a walk through, bitch don’t panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I’m here today cause I ain't never gave up

[Hook 1: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?

[Verse 1]
Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
The 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that ""Drake you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Outro]
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

[Verse 2]
The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Fuck her, don't need her no more
Six in a row, get a bitch, give her the bone
Break her like six in them stones
Niggas so cold, thinking I sit in the snow
I keep a bitch getting stoned
Smoke in my home, all my whips covered in chrome
All my dips love giving dome
Get it to go, back to my crib stuffing cones
Y'all either kids or my clones
We turnt up on marijuana and champagne
Them niggas talk ‘bout who they are, but they don’t do a thing
Can't tell me I ain't drunk I'm on that water in the club
Different strokes, find me a bitch I can poke

In love with my slang, I'm puffing a J
I hunt her today, come up with a play
Most of these niggas be wanting to cuff on a bitch
I just be up in the way, stuff in the safe
I'm loving the race, stuck in first place
Fuck her for days
Them niggas wanna talk about it but they don't wanna roll
What it takes to be a real G, they don't even know

Back up off me, they want my backs in coffins
It's so cold in the D and they still wanna take my jacket off me
Back when I couldn't afford to get it mixed and mastered, homie
My mama fronted me that money so it's no backup, homie
Bitch so back up off me
Bank account look like a ballot, homie, yeah it's checked up
My niggas packin', you get to trippin', they unpackin', homie
Yeah I overdo it, yeah that's salad, homie
Yeah I'm overdressed and ain't no salad on me
Me and DeJ together, holy matrimony
Yohhh, it's hard to smile and shit
When they ain't free Juan, I got real ones on trial and shit
Fuck all my peers unless we talkin' bout Belle Isle and shit
The check is seven figures, I might try and dial the shit
And if I fuck and make you cum, don't be blowin' up my phone
Lately I've been messin' with girls who tend to own shit on their own
I turn dusk into dawn, turn my chair to a throne
Fuck her off in the whip, make her take Uber home
Cold to the chromosome, I grew up without a hammock
I did everything except panic, feel me? Finally Famous the family
And we expandin' on the top floor like we tannin'
She throwin' tantrums
She gon' hold this dick like a Grammy
I give her bomb D and do damage, she like...

‘Cause I got me for life (Yeah)
Oh, I don't need a hand to hold
Even when the night is cold
I got that fire in my soul

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
And as far as I can see, I just need privacy
Plus a whole lot of tree, fuck all this modesty
I just need space to do me
Give the world what they're tryna see
A Stella Maxwell right beside of me
A Ferrari, I'm buyin' three
A closet of Saint Laurent, get what I want when I want
‘Cause this hunger is drivin' me, yeah
I just need to be alone, I just need to be at home
Understand what I'm speakin' on
If time is money I need a loan
But regardless I'll always keep keepin' on
Fuck fake friends!

Yeah, and I don't like talkin' to strangers
So get the fuck off me, I'm anxious
I'm tryna be cool, but I may just go ape shit
Say ""Fuck y'all!"" to all of y'all faces
It changes though now that I'm famous
Everyone knows how this lifestyle is dangerous
But I love it, the rush is amazin'
Celebrate nightly and everyone rages
I found how to cope with my angers
I'm swimmin' in money
Swimmin' in liquor, my liver is muddy
But it's all good, I'm still sippin' this bubbly
This shit is lovely, this shit ain't random, I didn't get lucky
Made it right here ‘cause I'm sick with it, cuddy

[Intro]

[Hook: Missy Elliott]
Shorty what?
The dance that you doing is dumb
How they do it where you from?
Stickin' out your tongue
Girl, but you know you're too young
A bunch of girls do it and the shit look fun
That's how they do it where we from
You know it don't start till one
That's how they do it where they from

[Verse 1: Missy Elliott]
I'm so faded, no exaggeration
Backs breakin' like a percolation
Boys to the yard for some hip spankin'
Where you make it drop down like you in the matrix
Can't take it, them chicks been fakin'
Y'all still sleep, better stay awakened
Hot new dance for the hood to make it
Make the donk move fast, make them think you drinkin'
Head to the floor don't collect that though
You better huddle up cause the beat's so cold
Pop that, pop that, cock and reload
This another hit, I got an ace in the hole
Boys on my back, playa did you peep that?
You got a small stack, playa, you can keep that
I'm a Big Mac make you wanna eat that
Like m-m-m-m-m, yak it to the yak
Junk in the trunk make you pumps in the bump
Girls wanna have fun make you stickin' out your tongue

[Hook: Missy Elliott]
The dance that you doing is dumb
How they do it where you from?
Stickin' out your tongue girl
But you know you're too young
A bunch of girls do it and the shit look fun
That's how they do it where we from
You know it don't start till one
That's how they do it where they from

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
I come into this bitch like liquid
Drip, drip, then the business
Click, click, get your picture
Hermés Trismegistus
Witness and get lifted
Basic, nigga I was born in the basement
Shape shift, nigga I think like a spaceship
False, oh-nah-nah-nah
I am so different than y'all, so far apart
The way that I balance the bars
I never fall, and if I do I just call
The almighty yellow star, God
Lyrically I'm Optimus Prime
The car I drive, look far I ride
When I go by, smoke in your eyes
So open your eyes, the joke's on you guys
And you ain't gotta be a mason to see through
Some of this shit on occasion

[Hook: Missy Elliott]
The dance that you doing is dumb
How they do it where you from?
Stickin' out your tongue girl
But you know you're too young

That's how they do it where we from
You know it don't start till one
That's how they do it where they from

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
I'm like kak-a-rak-a-rak-rak-a-rak-a-rak
Make a new track, make 'em fall on they crack
Give 'em a slap, appetizer and smack
I'm so fat in the back, make the boys all collapse
Yeah when I rap they be all on my jack
Boys wanna jump on this pussy cat
Got a new idea, let me switch it
Man, I'm so futuristic
Big lips and big, big, big hips
Body be thick like a biscuit
Different, rippin' shit, microphone grippin' it
Gettin' these Benjamins, new car, whippin' it
Uh, I'm so far ahead of ya'll, man I'm on top of the stars
I don't care none of you are, blah-blah-blah-blah
You best to go rewrite your bars

[Outro Missy Elliott & (Pharrell)]
Shawty what?
How they do it where you from? (Triflin'!)
How they do it where you from?
That's how they do it where we from

What is this? Maybach Music
I like this Maybach Music

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
She's just perfect in every kinda way
But I don't think I can handle her pain
So messed up and I'm too busy just running my game
Oh, girl after girl, mistake after mistake

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I've tried to change but they always around, pulling me down in bed
Gave you my word but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex
I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Sorry, won't turn back the clock
Baby I took advantage cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh I'm sorry don't make it right, I know

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We at the crib, she got her legs wrapped around my waist
Conversation, she lick every tattoo that's on my face
Like a thug, I just wanna fuck, that's every day
Temporary separations, confessin' my mistakes
She packed her bags and left me home and I'm still hurt
You new pussy, but she can't tell me that it's real first
A lot of lies apologized, the thirst real
When she hear this thinking to herself, ""Damn this verse real""
Rehab out in Vegas, that made this a murdered sin
Sent the bottles to her table then made love on the jet
Temporary thrills, all these women you think I tossed
My feelings genuine, disregard what you see on blogs
I been a boss before I recorded Meek song
Mill in cash on the gram, they trending Meech home
In the D and my G, he throwin' that P-Stone
Every picture that you post, we comments on each one

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I'm just a typical ordinary nigga
But I know that I can't change the rules
All this time I blamed you cause I know what I'm doing
Stepping on your heart again, relationship ruined
I tried to change but I'm always out, fucking around in the club
Pieces of my love letter tore up from this break up
My worst nightmare went right in my back, I wish I could wake up
I feel like shit, know I ain't shit but I'm

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Sorry, won't turn back the clock
Baby I took advantage cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh I'm sorry don't make it right, I know

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Life's short and baby girl you deserve a winner
Every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger
Hustle from my heart so every night I can deliver
Sayin' sorry, layin' up, I'm way up in your liver
Boss, the red bottoms got you walkin' funny
Get you an agent, she ballin' and all she talk is money
Take her shoppin', baby boy ain't no salary caps
She get it poppin' so you better bring battery packs
Perfect time to relax
Nothing is perfect other than me and the perfect match
They all watch me cause the moves I make out they budget
Diamond district, six figures on my shorty nugget

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I've tried to change but they always around, pulling me down in bed
Gave you my word but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex
I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit

Sorry, won't turn back the clock
Baby I took advantage cause I knew you

Waiting on my taxes, lights camera action
Finna play Michael Jackson, Oprah's in a jacket
Take it but I'll match it, y’all not in my bracket
It’s iHeart Memphis but I also love dabbing
I done took off on em, I feel like a pilot
I done took off on em, I don’t care bout the mileage
I’m so VIP all I know is private
I’ll take the steak, the strip, and the salad
Cause growing up in Memphis, Tennessee I couldn’t have it
Now come correct

[Hook]
Lean and dab, lean and dab
Lean and dab, lean and dab
Lean and dab, lean and dab
Lean and dab, lean and dab

Uh, back in it, it been a minute
Here she go with all that, ""where you been at?""
I been at it, tryna get it
Gotta admit it, I look good with it
You would look good sitting in my car when I start the engine
Left an impression on her greater than my grand entrance
Now she wrapped up in that jet living
Imagining herself in the wifey position
Naked under aprons in the kitchen while I'm blazing something amazing
Plan the next mission, she share my dollar sign vision
And she finer than that fine print contract, big business
Bottom line, she can get it, let her have it, then she feel it

She know if it was a fifth, then we would post some shots and take 'em
She'll be safe cause me and her make a real good combination
Every day she wear her birthday suit, happy belated
Then she drop it down low and pick it up like elevators
Oh Lord, no draws

She throw it at a nigga like a snowball
And I'mma give her something she can choke on Lil Tunechi, yeah

Niggas steady trippin' so I'm steady grippin'
Dirty money on me, got a scale up on me
I don't fuck with phony, 'bout to sell a pony
All these niggas on me, all these bitches on me
Say my price is good, motherfucker, show me

Went and bought a 911 with my trap money
A million up but still ain't never touch my rap money
I'm out in LA fuckin' with that boy OT
Flew to LA, got a plug on that OG
You know I've been gettin' money if you know me
When I first met my plug, I told him, ""I piss a hundred G's""
I ain't comin' to get it unless you got a hundred piece
I don't want it, fuck it, your price, you need to cut it
Your ice, you need to tuck it, she fuck with me, she lucky
A half a million, all 20s in that Gucci luggage
Let's skip the small talk, it's time to talk numbers
Young nigga playin' with commas, might go get a Lamb for the summer
I've been outchea in these streets all my life hustlin'
My nigga beefin' then I'm beefin', wrong or right I'm bustin'
My traphouse, I love it
Put some Forgis on my old school and I had to gut it
But should I put a roof in?

Yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Everybody 'round me sayin' I should relax, cause
I've been goin' hard 'til my eyes roll backward
All I wanna do is forget about my past, and
Smoke a little weed, really nothin' too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smilin'
Probably cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the Fanta
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back, but
I'mma let it slide cause my niggas too violent
Shout-out to the ones who spend money like a habit
Even if they had a million dollars they'd be trappin'
Got a couple girls shootin' movies on the mattress
Then I hit the booth, make the motherfuckin' soundtrack
Then I play it back on that eighty-inch plasma
Then I get 'em faded off that super fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic
Nobody can handle me, I'm gone

[Hook: The Weeknd]
When the shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not

[Verse 2: Belly]
Bitches know, told a ho, ""It's different strokes for different folks""
Came up out the north, we was playin' with a different snow
Took my niggas from the 401 to Pacific Coast
We no longer put no fish scale on the fishin' boat
Listen ho, I know all you bitches want is liquor, smoke
I know all you bitches want is dick and dough
Told her, ""You don't gotta make it difficult""
Baby, sit calm, we don't need another episode
Hippy bitches sendin' me titty pictures
She told me no religion was the new religion
She said she don't believe in God but her shoes Christian
I heard she servin' everybody like the soup kitchen
Gettin' hoes higher, gettin' hoes higher
She got work in the mornin', I'm gettin' hoes fired
Why the fuck you call it purp when you mix it pink?
You know I fuckin' mix the drinks when the shit's too strong

[Hook: The Weeknd]
When the shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not

('Cause I've been smoking a lot, and I've been drinking)
I might not make it, oh no I might not make it

Yeah, yeah

[Hook: Drake]
Dropped outta school, now we dumb rich (dumb rich)
This sound like some forty-three-oh-one shit (one shit)
All my niggas wanna do is pop style (pop style)
Turn my birthday into a lifestyle (a lifestyle)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it (do not make it)
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum
(they do, they do)
And I like to finish what you think you started
Man, you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started
You don't know what you just started
All I do is hang with the young and heartless
All this for my family, man, I try my hardest
It's all I ever did and look where it got him
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately
You've still got my number, girl, you need to call me
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way
But you know I always handle that one my way
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway
I can't trust no fuckin' body
They still out to get me cause they never got me

[Verse 2: The Throne (Kanye West  +  JAY Z)]
They still out to get me, they don't get it
I cannot be got, and that's a given
They like, ""Pablo—""
""Why are all the windows tinted on your Tahoe?""
""Why do you know every single bitch that I know?""
""Why can't you just shut your mouth and take the high road?""
Fuck if I know, that's that Chicago
South, south side, that's the motto
Cop a crib and spend ten million on remodel
Take the devils out my life
And preach the gospel, 'cause I know
We went way, way past the line of scrimmage, aye
Throne is back up in it, aye
In the field like Emmitt, aye, y'all get so offended, aye
I be blacking out, I ain't backing out
Jay about his business, and I'mma let you finish, but I
I just, I just, I just, I just wanna rock your body
Take you to the garage and do some karate
Chop it, chop it, chop it, chop it sipping sake
Throw a thick bitch on a Kawasaki
(Perfect)

Seems like they're just happier than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently

Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it

Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
Sacrificing things
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...

I'm beyond all that fuck shit, hey

[Verse 1: Lil Yachty]
Hey lil' mama, would you like to be my sunshine?
Nigga touch my gang, we gon' turn this shit to Columbine
Ice on my neck cost me ten times three
Thirty thousand dollars for a nigga to get flee
I just hit Rodéo and I spent like ten Gs
I just did a show and spent the check on my mama
When I go on vacay I might rent out the Bahamas
And I keep like ten phones, damn I'm really never home
All these niggas clones, tryna copy what I'm on
Nigga get your own, tryna pick a nigga bone
Word to brother Skip, boy I had a good day
Metro PCS trappin', boy I'm makin' plays
Fifty shades of grey, beat that pussy like Hulk Hogan
I know you know my slogan, if it ain't 'bout guap I'm gone
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm chosen from the concrete I had rose
Shawty starin' at my necklace 'cause my diamonds really froze
Put that dick up in her pussy, bet she feel it in her toes
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
I'm a real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows
Real young nigga from the six throwin' 'bows

[Hook: D.R.A.M.]
In the middle of the party, bitch get off me
In the cut I'm rollin' up my broccoli
Ya I know your baby mama fond of me
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli
Whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me
Said that I can get that pussy easily
Said that I can hit that shit so greasily
I'm a dirty dog, I did it sleazily

Ain't no tellin' what I'm finna be on

[Verse 2: D.R.A.M.]
I got companies and Pesos
I got people on my payroll
She don't do it 'less I say so
I don't smoke if it ain't fuego
I should sauce 'em up like Prego
Fettucini with Alfredo
All I wanted was the fame and every game they made on Sega
I was five or six years old when I had told myself, ""Okay you're special""
But I treat you like my equal never lesser
I was twenty-six years old when we had dropped this one amazing record
Had the world steppin'
That's what I call epic
Couple summers later I got paper
I acquired taste for salmon on a bagel
With the capers on a square plate
At the restaurant with the ""why you got to stare"" face
To know I either ball or I record over the snare and bass
Rapper face, dread headed
Golden diamond teeth wearin'
They just mad cause I got that cheese, bitch, I keep dairy
Turnt up in the party gettin' lit to Yachty
With a Spanish Barbie, word to my mami

[Hook: D.R.A.M.]
In the middle of the party, bitch get off me (Get off of me)
In the cut I'm rollin' up my broccoli (My weed, my weed)
Ya I know your baby mama fond of me (She fond of me)
All she want to do is smoke that broccoli
(My weed, my weed)
Whispered in my ear she trying to leave with me

Said that I can let that pussy easily

Said I can hit that shit so greasily (Oh yeah, oh yeah)

[Intro: Big Sean  + DJ Khaled]
(This is, this is...)
Doing what I gotta do, aaaa
What up though?
We the best music...
I guess I'm on my Don shit
What that mean?
I'mma go, aaaa
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man
Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'mma take it
Just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple
They can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre
Except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement
With you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key

[Hook: Betty Wright  + DJ Khaled]
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said ""Fuck Mother Earth,"" that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two knew Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix

[Hook: Betty Wright  + DJ Khaled]
Oh yeah, mhm yeah
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine

They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' yayo to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

[Hook: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

[Hook: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

All of my niggas with me, you feel me
Straps on everybody in the building

Now you in my living room twerkin', that's crazy
You wear that body suit, I know you tryna tease me
I put on that Tiller, she'd rather fuck me to Weezy
I remember when your money was young
And you stripped all week just to get the tan Yeezy's
Back when lame niggas hit you with the one liners
All sounding the same like Future and Desiigner

Round after round to decisions

Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back

And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

And I love the way your breath
Numbs me like novacaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever

And when we touch, I'm shivering
